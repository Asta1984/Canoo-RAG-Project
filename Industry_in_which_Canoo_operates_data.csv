 Overview  
This is Ofcom’s fifth annual Media Nations report, a research report for industry, policymakers, 
academics and consumers. The main objectives of the report are to review key trends in the media 
sector and set out how audiences are served in the UK. We adopt a c ross-platform perspective, 
including broadcast TV and radio, as well as digital delivery including online video and audio 
streaming.  
As in previous years, this report is accompanied by an interactive report  containing an extensive 
range of data. We also publish separate reports for Northern Ireland , Scotland  and Wales  covering 
specific themes and issues relevant to those nations.  
Rapid change continues to characterise the TV and online video sectors  and the radio and audio 
sectors. We focus on evolving consumer behaviour, and the key industry trends and dynamics 
shaping this, drawing on a range of relevant evidence. 
Another central focus of this year’s report is public service broadcasting (PSB). This fol lows the 
conclusion last year of Ofcom’s Small Screen: Big Debate  review of the sector, which made 
recommendations to Government for new legislation, and the publication in April of the 
Government ’s Broadcasting White Paper . In our dedicated chapter on PSB , we provide data an d 
commentary on public service broadcasters’ performance and strategies to continue to inform the 
debate about the future of the sector.  
Ofcom’s Media Nations report addresses the requirement to undertake and make public our 
consumer research (as set out in Sections 14 and 15 of the Communications Act 2003). It also meets 
the requirements on Ofcom under Section 358 of the Communications Act 2003 to publish an annual 
factual and statistical report on the TV and radio sector. Media Nations 2022

 What we have found,  in brief 
Over all viewing of TV and video has fallen from its pandemic peak, with broadcasters 
losing share despite improved performance for their on -demand services  
• The average amount of time people spent watching TV and video content in 2021 , across all 
devices, was 5 hours 16 minutes per person per day, down 2 5 minutes on 2020, which  was more 
heavily influenced by  Covid -19 restrictions, but up on 2019.  
• Time spent watching TV from broadcasters – across linear channels, recordings and on -demand – 
fell by 9% compared to 2020 and 4% compared to 2019, illustrating that the long-term trend of 
decline in overall viewing of broadcasters’ content , seen over the past decade , has resumed. 
Broadcasters’ viewing share fell to 59% in 2021, down from 61% in 2020 and 67% in 2019. 
• Broadcaster video -on-demand (BVoD) bucked the trend of post- pandemic declines in viewing 
time, with time spent watching services such as BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and All 4 increasing by an 
average of three minutes per person per day to 15 minutes, partially offsetting the declines for 
other forms of broadcast TV viewing.  
• Subscription video -on-demand (SVoD) services like Netflix and Disney+ were used by 67% of UK 
households  by Q2  2022,  declining  from  a peak  of 68%  in Q1.  Collectively,  these  services  have  broadly 
retained their share of viewing after achieving a surge in take-up in 2020, accounting for 18% of 
total TV viewing in 2021 (19% in 2020), or an average of 58 minutes viewing per person per day.  
• YouTube and Facebook remain the largest social video platforms in the UK, respectively reaching 
92% and 95% of UK internet users aged 15+ in Q1 2022. TikTok continues to grow, reaching 35% 
of adult internet users and 66% of online 15 -24-year- olds. 
A resurgent TV advertising market helped commercial public ser vice broadcasters achieve 
their highest revenues in five years in 2021  
• Total audio -visual revenues increased to £19bn in 2021, up 16.9% on 2020. This significant rise 
reflected a return to growth for some sectors of the industry, but also a surge in online  video 
advertising and SVoD revenue, which together accounted for 58% of the £2.7bn increase.  
• Commercial broadcast revenues, which were adversely affected by the impact of Covid -19 in 
2020, rebounded strongly in 2021, rising by 10.6% to £11.3bn, which was also 4.5% higher than 
the 2019 total.  
• Despite a 13% decline in live TV viewing in 2021, TV advertising returned to growth after six 
consecutive years of contraction, with revenue rising to £4.7bn in the year, boosted by the return 
of major live sporting ev ents like Euro 2020. This helped the commercial public service 
broadcasters (PSBs) ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 to collectively generate their highest revenues 
since 2016, at £2.4bn. However, an anticipated economic slowdown could restrict future growth.  
The SVoD market is maturing, with providers evolving their business models as they seek 
to maintain revenue growth  
• A combination of price rises and increases in subscriber numbers drove strong revenue growth 
for the SVoD sector in 2021, with the 27% year-on -year increase, to £2.7bn, almost matching the 
bumper 28% growth  in 2020. Media Nations 2022

 • However, the number of households yet to try SVoD is becoming smaller and harder to convert, 
resulting in slower subscriber growth; meanwhile, the cost -of-living crisis is making cus tomer 
retention more challenging. Less-established services such as Apple TV+, Discovery+ and 
Paramount+ face strong competition to be one of several services used in households that 
already take one or more of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Disney+.  
• In anticipation of slower subscriber growth, most SVoD providers are incorporating advertising 
into their offerings, typically as part of lower -cost tiers, although Amazon’s Freevee is free to use.  
• Streaming services with hybrid business models may become more common, with SVoD players’ 
tiered offerings representing competition to BVoD services such as ITV’s planned ITVX, a 
streaming revamp that will combine ITV Hub, ITV Hub+ and BritBox into a single service.  
There is broad satisfaction with public service broa dcasting among those who  watch it, as 
PSBs  evolve in a bid to arrest declining viewing  
• In line with the long- term decline in viewing of broadcast TV, PSBs have seen both audiences and 
levels of viewing continue to fall. The w eekly reach of PSB channels fell to 76% of all individuals in 
2021, down from 80% in 2019, with less than half (47%) of 16-24-year-olds watching at least 15 
consecutive minutes of the PSB channels in an average week . 
• The remaining audiences are broadly satisfied with PSB, with two -third s (67%) of those watching 
PSB channels in the past six months saying so, and only 12% saying that they are dissatisfied, 
figures that are broadly consistent across age groups. Trusted and accurate UK news is 
considered by audiences to be one of the most important attributes  of PSB. 
• Following production challenges at the height of the pandemic, PSB spend on first -run UK 
originated content returned to growth in 2021 and reached its highest level since 2017, at 
£2.6bn. Such investment, along with that from mul tichannel broadcasters and international SVoD 
providers, looks set to continue boosting the production sector, with the number of high -end TV 
productions (big-budget programmes ) made in the UK in 2021 reach ing a historic high of 211.  
The ways in which people access and listen to  radio and audio content continue to evolve , 
as radio broadcasters recover from the pandemic to varying degrees  
• The proportion of audio listening time accounted for by live radio has fallen  from 75% in 2017 to 
63% in 2022, while the share of music streaming services  such as Spotify or Apple Music has more 
than doubled, from 8% to 20% . 
• About  nine in ten adults listen to live radio each week, with commercial radio attracting more 
listeners than BBC radio. Radio sets (including both DAB and analogue) continue to be the main 
way to listen to the radio, accounting for 73 % of listening hours  in Q1  2022, while  10% were  via 
smart speakers, 12% were  via other online means  and a further 5% were through digital TV.  
• For young adults (aged 15 -34), listening to online music via a streaming service account ed for the 
greatest amount of time spent listening t o audio  in Q1 2022, at 47 % of weekly audio listening , 
represent ing a substantial increase from 22% in 201 7. 
• Radio revenues totalled £ 638m in 2021, up 20% year on year, and 4% higher than 2019, with 
growth driven by national adverting revenues. While advertising, sponsorship and other revenue 
increased across the sector as a whole, the strength and nature of the recovery since 2020 has 
varied across stations and broadcasters, with some continuing to note di fficult  trading conditions. Media Nations 2022

 TV and video consumption trends  
Introduction:  audiences continue to shift their viewing from linear 
TV to on -demand 
Following 2020, when  TV and video viewing habits were significantly impacted by Covid -19-related 
restrictions, tr ends in 2021 and early 2022 have pointed both to  the resumption of long -term, pre-
pandemic trends, and to  the lasting impact of the long periods of lockdown. While most types of 
viewing have fallen from the unprecedented levels of  2020, people are spen ding  an increasing 
proportion of their viewing time watching on-demand content, including on services provided on a 
subscription basis (e.g.  Netflix) and free -to-view from broadcasters (e.g . BBC iPlayer) and social video 
platforms (e. g. YouTube). 
This chapter draws on data from audience- measurement and ratings agencies, as well as consumer 
surveys, to evidence and provide commentary on continuing shifts in audiences’ TV and video 
viewing habits and preferences.  
Total video viewing 
View ing time trends  
Overall viewing of TV and video has fallen from its pandemic peak  
The average amount of time people spent watching TV and video content across all devices in 2021 
was 5 hours 16 minutes per person per day, 25 minutes less than in  2020 (which was more heavily 
influenced by Covid-19 restrictions than 2021, with longer periods of lockdown ) but up on 2019.  Media Nations 2022

Many forms of viewing decreased in 2021, but BVoD has  continued to grow  
Viewing of SVoD services was inflated in 2020 due to people being at home more because of 
pandemic -related restrictions. In 2021, SVoD viewing time across all devices decreased by 6% , to 58 
minutes a day on average. However, this only slightly decreased the SVoD share of all video  viewing, 
from 19% to 18%.  
The average  amount of  time spent watching  content from TV broadcasters in 2021 – across live TV, 
recordings, and on -demand , on all devices –  was 3 hours 7  minutes per person  per day. This was 
down by 19  minutes ( 9%) on 2020, which h ad, like SVoD, experienced a  pandemic -related  increase.  
It was also lower than in 2019,  showing that the long -term trend of declines  in overall broadcaster 
TV viewing , seen over the past decade , has resumed . 
This decline in broadcaster viewing was driven by people watching less live and recorded broadcast 
TV, although  viewing on BVoD services did not follow this trend; it  increased by an average of three 
minutes per person per day compared to 2020 . This resulted in BVoD’s share of overall viewing 
increasing by 2  percentage points to 8%. But t his only partially compensated for the decline in other 
forms of broadcast TV viewing; broadcasters’ overall viewing share fell to 59 %, down from 61% in 
2020.

changes in methodology since the publication of Media Nations 2021 have resulted in the re- calculation of 
figures for 2020.  
SVoD and YouTube together accounted for more than half of young people’s viewing  
Young adults aged 16 -34 reduced their viewing of video content by more than  half an hour a day on 
average  between 2020 and 2021, as they spent less time under Covid-related restrictions. Most 
forms of video were subject to this decline, following the trends observed for all viewers, outlined 
above. In fact, for 16-34s, 2021 was the first year since 2017 in wh ich their viewing on SVoD and 
YouTube reduced . Their SVoD viewing decreased by 11 minutes a day on average (a  small reduction 
in share of video viewing , from 29% to 28%),  perhaps reflecting the  limited scope for growth via new 
subscriptions , compared to older cohorts. Viewing of YouTube (not on a TV set) also declined 
slightly, by two minutes. D espite the decline in viewing minutes since  2020, SVoD and YouTube 
together accounted for just over half (53%) of all viewing among 16-34s in 2021, as  it did in 2020 
(51%) . 
The main exception to the general reduction in viewing time was BVoD, viewing of which increased 
by an average of three minutes per day. However, this only partially mitigated  the 21 -minute  decline 
in live and recorded viewing, and consequently broadcasters’ overall viewing share declined from 32% in 2020 to 30% in 2021.  -25-22-6-2-1123 BVoD

The final of Women’ s Euro 2022 between England and Germany was one of the most-watched TV 
programmes in the first seven months of 20 22, attracting an average audience of 1 1.2 million on 
BBC One’s broadcast TV channel1 and a further 5.9 million programme requests  on BBC iPlayer and

SVoD audiences are drawn to UK -produced titles , the most -popular of which are on Netflix  
Viewing habits on SVoD services suggest a strong appetite for new and original UK -produced 
programming. The top nine most-watched titles on Netflix were all commissioned by , or exclusively 
available on, the SVoD service, and half  of the top ten were produced in the UK. These included the 
series Stay Close , After Life  and Bridgerton, and the documentary The Tinder Swindler . In addition, an 
increasing proportion of time on UK Netflix is being spent watching originals and exclusives3 – in Q1 
2022, an average UK account streamed 45 minutes of content first available on Netflix per day, an 
increase of nine minutes compared to Q1 2021 (36 minutes).4 
The second season of Bridgerton  saw even more binge-watching behaviour  than the first. At its 
release on 25 March 2022, 876,000 UK Netflix accounts binged all eight episodes on the show’s 
opening weekend, 570,000 more than for season one’s opening weekend (306,000). By the end of 
May 2022, 6.9 million households had watched the second season in full , giving it the fourth highest 
UK reach of any title on Netflix in the first five months of the year. M ini-series Stay Close  achieved 
similar levels of viewing and bing eing, reaching 6.9 million households in Q1 2022, with 835,000 UK 
Netflix accounts watching all eight episodes in the show’s opening weekend and 2.1 million bingeing 
on it across the opening week.  
More recently, the first seven episodes of season four of St ranger Things , released on 27 May 2022, 
were binged by 1.2 million UK households in its opening weekend (Friday to Sunday), with 2.2

Findings from Ofcom’s VoD Survey o f online adults and teens aged 13+ indicate a stronger 
preference among UK audiences for programmes made in the UK over those made in the US – 38% 
stated this preference, while only 8% said they preferred US-made programmes. Older people were 
more likely to  say they preferred UK-made content (55% of over-64 s said this, compared to only 17% 
of 13-17-year-olds), while younger adults were more likely to say they preferred US-made content (18% of 13-17-year-olds said this, compared to 2% of over-64 s). However, just over half (52%) of 
adults and teens said they liked UK- and US -made programme equally.

 Broadcast TV and catch -up viewing  
The decline in TV viewing has accelerated since mid -2021 
This section sets out trends for broadcast TV viewing in 2021 and early 2022, in the context of 
longer -term trends across age demographics. More detailed analysis of public service broadcasters’ 
viewing performance can be found in the public service broadcasting  chapter.  
The average amount of time spent watching broadcast TV on the TV set (including catch -up, on-
demand and recorded  viewing up to 28 days after live broadcast) was 2 hours 59 minutes per person 
per day in in 2021. This was 20 minutes (11%) lower than in 2020 and 10 minutes (5%) lower than 2019, illustrating the resumption of the long- term trend of decline following the pandemic -driven 
boost. This trend re -established in April 2021  (following the conclusion of the third national 
lockdown) , when the average amount of  time spent viewing broadcast TV started to decline below 
2019 levels. Since then, each month has consistently been lower than in previous yea rs. 
There are also signs that the decline in viewing has begun to accelerate. Contrary to the typical trend in previous years, in 2021 there was  no uptick in viewing after the summer, with a decline of four 
minutes a day on average between August and September (compared to 2019 , for example, which 
increase d by  eight minutes). So far, 2022 has had  notably lower levels of viewing  – over the first six 
months of the year, average daily viewing in each month f ell by an average of 33 minutes compared 
to the same month in 2021.

TV viewing decreased across all age groups in 2021 compared to 2020, with every cohort seeing a 
drop  in the number of minutes watched, ranging from 5% (65 -74-year-olds) to 23% (16-24s).

 pandemic: 5 hours 50 minutes in 2021, compared to 5 hours 35 minutes in 2019.  For this group, th e 
figure was higher than in 2011.

Looking at longer -term trends, TV viewing has declined much faster for younger people than for 
older people, with changes ranging from slight growth among the oldest cohorts to successively 
greater declines for each younger cohort. For example, since 2011, 16-24-year-olds have watched 1 
hour 52 minutes less (68%) on average, while 55-64-year-olds have watched only 39 minutes less (12%).  
But recent figures from  the first half of 2022, have shown signs of a switch in this long -term trend ; 
average year -on-yea r declines in monthly broadcast TV viewing minutes for younger demographics 
have been exceeded by the declines among older viewers – a 27- minute drop for 16 -34-year-olds, 
compared to 35 minutes for 35-54s and 43 minutes for over-54s .
10 
This is partly beca use the levels of viewing among older people have come down from higher levels 
during the initial peaks of Covid-19. But it could also be a sign that  the use of streaming services, 
particularly SVoD, is starting to affect  older people’s viewing habits in similar ways to younger 
people. For 16 -34-year-olds, meanwhile, the 2022 indicators suggest that broadcast TV viewing 
declines may be beginning to level out. Average daily viewing in this age demographic fell to below 
an hour a day in March 2022 and, so far, has continued to be lower than this – this reduces the 
scope for further significant declines if young people continue to retain at least some level of reliance on broadcast TV, for genres such as news and current affairs, and popular 
entertainment/reality programming like Love Island.

Take -up and subscription habits 
Growth in SVoD households  slowed following a surge in 2020, and there was  a decline in Q2 2022  
After years of strong growth in the number of households using SVoD services, take- up began to 
slow in 2021, before declining in Q2 2022, as the rising cost of living put pressure on consumer 
spend. The proportion of households subscribing to at least one SVoD service fell to 67%, or 19. 2 
million households, down one percentage point compared to Q1 2022, a drop of more than 350,000 
households.11 Over the preceding nine months, SVoD penetration had increased by three percentage 
points to a peak of 68%, or 19.5 million households. This was a smaller increase than in the 
corresponding nine-month period in previous years, including before the initial Covid -19 period, 
which boosted consumer demand for SVoD during lockdowns.  
Netflix remains the largest SVoD provider in the UK, with 17.1 million households (60%) subscribing, 
followed by Amazon Prime Video (4 6%) and Disney+ (23%). Netflix and Amazon Prime Video both 
saw their base of subscribing households decline in Q2 2022 –  Netflix by around 210,000 and 
Amazon Prime Video by around 590,000 – though each still had more subscribers than they did in 
Q2 2021. Although the market slowdown affected third -placed Disney+, it still added subscribers in 
Q2 2022, but at a much slower pac e than in previous quarters –  its subscriber base increased by 1.8 
million (to 6.6 million) in the 12 months to Q2 2022, with Q2 accounting for just 5% ( around 90,000) 
of these. Sky’s NOW, which has consistently struggled to achieve growth as a flanker bra nd to Sky 
TV, saw its subscriber base decline over the 12 -month period, falling by around 220,000 to 2.1 
million, or 7% household penetration. Apple TV+ was in 6% of homes in Q2 2022, having seen its 
subscriber base decline in the second half of 2021 and t hen return to growth in the first half of 2022.

the time of publica tion. 
Netflix customers most commonly subscribe to the Standard tier  of the service , with 39% taking it in 
February 2022, according to Ofcom’s VoD Survey. This compares to 25% for the Premium tier and 
32% for the Basic tier, which is the most popular tier among older subscribers (those aged 45 and above). Upgrades between tiers were more common than downgrades in the 12 months to February 
2022, with 17% of subscribers switching to a higher-priced plan over this period, compared to 7% switching  down.
12 However, this was before Netflix implemented  another round of price rises in 
March 2022, when the monthly cost of each tier increased by £1, taking the price of the Standard 
tier to £10.99 and the Premium tier to £15.99. 
Take -up of multiple subscriptions within SVoD households has become increasingly common  
The launch of several new SVoD services over the past few years – and the successful roll-out of 
Disney+, in particular – has resulted in more households using multiple SVoD services. The average 
number  of SVoD subscriptions per SVoD home increased to two in Q1 2022, compared to 1.6 two 
years earlier, before the Covid -19-related lockdowns.13 This figure does not include free  trials and 
account sharing , which if accounted for would increase the average.  
The proportion of households accessing two or more services was 46% in Q1 2022, or 13.2 million 
households.14 Overlap between the three most popular services (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and 
Disney+) is significant, with 5.2 million households subscribing to all three . The majority of Disney+ 
subscribers  (80%)  take the service  in combination with both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, with 
only 2% taking it without either of those two services.

Cost is a key driver of SVoD cancellations, but most  of those dropping services thought they would 
probably resubscribe in the future  
Among those using subscription services in the three months leading up to our VoD Survey, 2% of 
Netflix users had cancelled their subscription in the past three months, while 4% of Amazon Prime 
Video users had cancelled, as had 4% of Disney+ users. Other SVoD services saw cancellation rates ranging between 2% and 16%, although data for t hese smaller services is based on smaller sample 
sizes and is therefore less precise as an indicator of broader subscriber trends within these customer bases.
15 
According to Ofcom’s PSM Tracker, cost featured in people’s reasons not using an SVoD service. 
Among those who ha d not used specific services in the past six months,16 a quarter (26%) cited  not 
wanting to pay / it was too expensive  as reasons for not using online streaming services. About  one 
in ten (9%)  mentioned not wanting to pay for more services than they already had or preferring 
another paid service . Apart  from cost,  respondents mentioned the content as the key reason why 
they did not subscribe to certain streaming services.

“We had to cancel our Netflix subscription because we could not afford to keep it going.”         
Man, 55 -64 
“Waste of money, plenty of channels to watch free.” Woman, 25 -34 
“I had a subscription to Amazon Prime but had this solely for free delivery on Amazon orders. I 
found it extremely difficult to fin d out when live sports games were on Amazon and have never 
renewed it.” Man, 75+  
Among those cancelling services, their reasons for doing so did not necessarily represent barriers to 
taking the m again in the future – our VoD Survey found that almost three -quarters (73%)  of people 
who cancelled in the three months prior  thought they would resubscribe. This reflects the flexibility 
of the SVoD consumer proposition ; some customers pick up and drop subscriptions depending on 
specific content availability and/or periodic changes in needs and circumstances.17 
There is evidence of SVoD account  sharing, although most users subscrib e by paying the provider 
directly 
According to our VoD Survey, most users of the three leading SVoD services (Netflix, Amazon Prime 
Video and Disney+) paid subscriptions directly to the provider, with Amazon Prime Video (84%) 
having the highest proportion of direct subscribers. However, there is some level of account sharing 
among SVoD users. Disney+ users  were most likely to share a login from someone who  they did not 
live with (17%).18 Relaxed policies on account sharing have helped SVoD services grow in popularity, 
but with subscriber growth set to slow for the larger services, curbing this behaviour and better 
monetising all users is becom ing more of a priority for some – certainly for Netflix (see next chapter 
for further analysis).  
Amazon Prime Video users are most likely to have their own subscription rather than share someone 
else’s account , partly because a high proportion of users (48%)19 take up Amazon Prime for the 
unlimited ex press shipping  of retail purchases, which makes tying a subscription to a home address 
necessary. Amazon also has few subscriber management agreements with its distribution partners, preferring to own the billing relationship itself . This means  that users on platforms such as Sky and 
Virgin Media cannot pay for the Amazon service as part of their pay -TV bill, as they can for Netflix.

BVoD has comparable levels of reach to SVoD, with most consumers using multiple streaming 
services 
High levels of take- up for SVoD services are matched by use of BVoD services, although the levels of 
viewing are not comparable, as discusse d above. According to Ofcom’s VoD Survey, more than nine 
in ten online adults and teens (93%) used a free-to -view service (any streaming service not behind a 
paywall, including YouTube). The proportion of total respondents who  said they used at least one 
SVoD service  (83%) was roughly equal to the proportion ( 82%) who  said they used a public service 
broadcaster’s VoD service (such as BBC iPlayer or ITV Hub) . This illustrates the high levels of overlap 
between these services ; more than half ( 52%) of online adults and teens said they use d both BBC 
iPlayer and Netflix,  for example.20 
Beyond the most popular SVoD services, there are a  number of small services in the UK that 
collectively have significant reach. This includes services such as ITV’s paid ti er, ITV Hub+, and genre 
specialist services Hayu (reality) and Crunchyroll (anime).  
Among all the streaming services, our VoD Survey found that BBC iPlayer was  the most popular for 
watching “programmes, films and other video ” – used by 74% of online adults  and teens – ahead of 
both Netflix and YouTube. YouTube’s lower reach in this context may be explained by its large 
volume of short -form content and creator videos, which survey respondents may not have 
considered21 – higher proportions of users said they used it to watch short -form video (see social 
video section below). The four PSB s’ BVoD services along with YouTube were the top five free 
streaming services ; the others were used by 10% or less of online adults and  teens.22

Among children, the major SVoD services achieved notable increases in reach  
Among children aged 3 -12, the leading SVoD platforms saw strong user growth in Q1 2022. Netflix 
increased its reach by 5 percentage points year  on year, to 62%, becoming the most popular service 
by overtaking YouTube / YouTube Kids, whose reach declined from 61% to 59%. But in terms of 
levels of use,  47% of 3-12-year-olds said they watched more YouTube than other platforms in 
general.23 
The loss of D isney children’s content on Netflix over the years since Disney’s own SVoD service 
launch does not appear to have slowed Netflix’s popularity among children. But Disney+ is gaining 
momentum quickly, achiev ing the biggest increase of any service over the ye ar, up from 31% of 3-
12-year-olds  in Q1 2021 to 37% in Q1 2022, beating BBC iPlayer to fourth place in popularity. While 
BBC iPlayer’s reach declined slightly, there were gains for the other PSB BVoD services (All 4, ITV Hub 
and My5), although they all sti ll have relatively small user bases among children, at 10% reach (ITV 
Hub) or less.24

Viewing  habits and audience satisfaction  
People are increasingly likely to turn to SVoD rather than  TV channels when looking for something 
to watch  
SVoD has d ramatically changed how viewers find something to watch. Forty per cent  of online adults 
and teens sa y they normally go  to SVoD first when looking for something to watch but do not have a 
specific programme in mind, compared to 37% who say  they try  TV channels first. Only 7% choose  
BVoD, less than those turning to YouTube first (11%).25 
Younger viewers’ limited reliance on TV channels is even more stark, with nine in ten 18-24-year-old 
online adults bypassing TV channels when looking for something to watch. More than half of 
internet users aged between 13 and 44 turn to SVoD first, with Netflix the most common destination 
(ranging between 44% and 46% for 13- 17s, 18-24s and 25-34s). Conversely, older adults were most 
likely to turn to TV channels first – 59% of 55-64-year-olds and 76% of those aged 65+.  BVoD’s 
popularity in this context also peaked among older users, with 11% of 55 -64-year-olds turning to it 
first. 26

The leading SVoD services have high rates of satisfaction  
When asked an open question on what they liked about the specific streaming services they had 
used in the past six months, respo ndents to our PSM Tracker survey mentioned the variety and 
range of programmes, the quality of the content , or specific genres they liked on different services. 
In addition to commenting on content, a much smaller proportion of respondents mentioned the 
services’ ease of use, watching when convenient,  or the lack of ad breaks.

Netflix and Disney+ were seen as easy to use and wide -ranging in their content. Netflix w as seen to 
be delivering well on attributes such as ‘ provides services that are easy to find my way around ’ (82%) 
and ‘easy to find something I want to watch’ (80%) by those who ha d watched it in the past six

‘programmes that are relevant to me’  (75%). For Disney+, attributes related to ease of use received 
high scores among those who ha d used it in the past six months: ‘provides service that are easy to 
find my way around’ (78%) and ‘ easy to find something I want to watch’ (74%). It also performed 
well on ‘ appeals to a wide range of different audiences ’ (73%) and ‘ programmes that I can watch and 
talk about with people I know’  (70%).  
BritBox was seen to be delivering well in offering relatable, distinctive UK content, among other 
areas. Seven in ten (72%) thought it delivered  ‘programmes made for UK audiences ’ well, and two -
thirds (65%) said it delivered well on ‘programmes that featur e people like me ’. In addition, it was 
seen to be delivering well on distinctive content, with two -thirds (67%) saying it d id well on 
‘programmes that are different in their approach to other providers ’. 
Sport, traditionally a genre more likely to be watched on linear broadcast channels, is increasingly 
being streamed by viewers 
BBC iPlayer is the most popular online video service , by some margin,  for watching live or catch- up 
sports content; it is  used by 25% of online adults and teens for this purpose. Amazon Prime Video 
comes second , at 18%.27 Netflix and Disney+’s sports programming on their respective UK platforms 
is currently limited to documentaries as opposed to live or catch- up events, explaining their absence 
from the list. However, Netf lix has expressed interest in acquiring premium sports content, 
reportedly failing in a bid to acquire live rights to Formula 1 racing in the US.28

 SVoD services, including those from tech companies (e.g. Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+) and 
those from tradi tional media companies (Discovery+), are increasingly focusing on sport as part of 
their streaming offerings, something that we analyse in greater detail in the next chapter.

Foreign -language programming on VoD services is widely watched by UK viewers  
Alongside UK audiences’ appetite for UK productions and drama, there is significant interest in non -
English language content o n VoD services. According to our VoD Survey, 42% of online adults and 
teens  had watched this type  of content in the past year, with 18 -24-year -olds the most likely to have 
watched it (66%), and those aged 75+ least likely (18%). Internet users from a minority ethnic group 
were more likely than white audiences to watch foreign-language content on VoD (60% versus 40%), with Black teens and adults most likely (67%) compared to Asian (58%) and mixed ethnicity (58%). Most viewers of non -English -language con tent on VoD  used English subtitles, although dubbing was 
also popular.

Netflix, in particular , is driving the push for programming produced around the world that is  
intended to reach international audiences. It  achieved new global viewing records in 2021 with 
Korean series Squid Game , which was watched (at least in part) in 142 million households i n 94 
countries in the first month of release. The dystopian drama was also Netflix’s most popular title 
among UK subscribers, watched by more than  10 million households (69% of Netflix homes) in 
2021.30 French detective drama Lupin was the second most-watched non- English -language 
programme on Netflix, with a reach of 5 million households (33%), followed by Spanish thriller 
Money Heist, watched by 3.7 million households (25%).

Young adults spend almost an hour on TikTok per day  
UK adult TikTok visitors spent an average of a bout 29 minutes per day on the platform in March 
2022, almost as much as Facebook and Messenger visitors spent on those apps (about  34 minutes). 
There were clear demographic differences in the time spent on social video platforms – older adult 
visitors to Facebook and Messenger spent more time than  15-24-year-olds on the platform, while 
15-24-year-old visitors to TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat spen t more  time on these platforms than  
older visitors. In March 2022 , nearly 5 million UK 15 -24-year-old TikTok visitors spent an average of 
about 57 minutes on TikTok per day, while the 5 million 15 -24-year-old Snapchat visitors spent 46 
minutes per day. By  comparison, 15-24 -year-old visitors to Facebook (inclu ding  Messenger) and 
Instagram spent 25 and 20 minutes per day respectively.37 In July 2021, TikTok increased the 
maximum video length from one minute to three minutes, and by October the average video length 
was two minutes, which may be contributing to the increased time spent on TikTo k.38

TikTok’s boom prompted a rush to bring rival short -form video features to market  
In 2020 t he popularity of TikTok prompted social -video -capable platforms to introduce similar short-
form orientated features – Instagram with Reels and YouTube with Shorts. As discussed in our 
Online Nation report , Instagram and Facebook’s parent company Meta (previously known as 
Facebook) said in its Q1 2022 earnings calls that Reels would be core to its business strategy and 
future growth. The company highlighted that 20% of the time spent on Instagram globally was spent 
on Reels, and that video overall makes up 50% of the time that people spend on Facebook.39 
Meanwhile, YouTube announced in June 2022 that 1.5 billion global users log into YouTube Shorts 
monthly.40 Alphabet, the parent company of YouTube, announced in its Q1 2022 earnings call that 
YouTube Shorts was averaging over 30 billion daily views – four times as m any as a year earlier.41 
Twitter is  set to follow this trend  in 2022, preparing to roll out a new test feature that invites users 
to post video reactions to tweets.  
Other  popular social video platforms are continu ing to adapt their business models. TikTok 
introduced Live Subscription in May 2022, a monthly subscription for creators of live TikTok content. 
TikTok intends this new initiative to further diversify creator monetisation opportunities. A feature of the subscription is that it offers Subscriber -Onl y Chat, where creators can chat directly with one 
another.
42 Snap is also  developing its service through  investing in UK originals. It plans to release two 
series, one featuring Rapper Aitch titled What the Aitch, and another featuring diver Tom Daley 
titled Secret Superpowers with Tom Daley.  The company has released more than  150 Snap Original

 TV industry trends and dynamics 
Introduction: a significant financial bounce- back for broadcasters 
following pandemic challenges  
The shock to the TV industry caused by Covid -19 in 2020 was followed in 2021 by a significant 
recovery for those worst affected, with commercial broadcasters benefiting from renewed interest 
and investment in TV advertising. For providers of online TV and video services relying on either 
advertising (e.g.  YouTube) or subscription revenue (e.g.  Netflix), the pandemic did not halt revenue 
growth in 2020, and 2021 brought significant increases that outstripped those achieved by 
commercial broadcasters and pay -TV platforms.  
This chapter quantifies the revenue generated across different sectors of the TV and online video market, and examines some of the underlying industry trends, across advertising, SVoD and pay TV. 
It also provides a summary of current dynamics in the TV production sector.  
Industry revenue overview  
TV and online video see record growth 
Commercial TV and online video revenues grew  by 18% in 2021 to £16. 6bn, a  rise that far exceeded 
any year-on -year change over the past ten years.  Online video’s surge brought it to a total value of 
£5bn in 2021; t his was driven by an 80% year -on-year increase in online video advertising revenue, 
to £2.3bn, while SVoD revenue increased by 27% to £2.7bn. Looking at the longer -term trend, online 
video advertising and SVoD subscription revenue are the two se ctors which are seeing long -term 
growth over and above  the 2021 recovery ; compared to 2019, they grew by 107% and 62%  
respectively.  
Figure 22: Commercial PSB revenue growth , 2021 vs 2019

For some broadcasters, 2021 represented a recovery  from the declines of 2020, with  improved 
performances compared  to recent pre -Covid -19 years.  For instance, commercial PSB channel groups 
ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 collectively generated revenue of £2.4b n, their highest total since 
Media Nations 2022 
30 
 2016, about  £180m (8%) more than what they generated in 2019. D igital multichannel groups such 
as Discovery Networks and UKTV , meanwhile,  recovered to £2.4bn, 2% more than in 2019. These 
sectors had been in decline, or flat,  for several years, and the  improvement  was driven by 
advertisers’ renewed investment in TV  as part of the  economic recovery from the pandemic. Further 
analysis of the PSBs’ financial performance in both  commercial and publicly -funded channels can be 
found in the next c hapter.  
Pay-TV platform operators such as Sky, Virgin Media and BT, which make up the largest single sector, 
recovered to generate £6.5bn in revenue . Like the PSBs and digital multichannels , this was an 
increase on 2019 (of 4%).

video industry, owing to restatements and improvements in methodologies. Values for ‘Platform operators’ include Ofcom’s estimates of pay -TV revenues. This does not include NOW, which is within subscription VoD.  
Platform operators’ data prior to 2019 is not comparable to subsequent years, owing to a change in 
methodology in Sky reporting coinciding with its change in ownership to Comcast. ‘Digital multichannels’ includes non -PSB channels and commercial PSB portfolio channels. ‘Commercial PSB channels’ comprise the 
following: ITV, STV, UTV, ITV Brea kfast, Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C. Online video advertising does not 
include ‘outstream’ video advertising delivered on non- video services. Totals may not equal the sum of the

 How we present financial data  
Financial data quote d in this report is presented in nominal terms, meaning that historical data has 
not been adjusted to account for inflation. In our interactive report , users can view financial data in 
either nominal or ‘real’ (CPI -adjusted) terms, with users able to easily switch between the two. 
Our use of nominal data in the written reports provides a straightforward view of the market in 
terms commonly used. For those who  wish to analyse how inflation has historically affected the 
value of the industry, the CPI-adjusted series in our interactive report  provide an indicative measure.  
Advertising market trends  
Advertising spend rebounded in 2021 , with strong TV and  online sectors  
A broad recovery in the advertising market in 2021 saw  expenditure increase to £31.9bn , a year -on-
year increase of 34%. The contraction in 2020, the first since 2012, hit cinema and out-of -home 
advertising hardest, with drops of 82% and 4 6% respectively . Cinemas were closed for much of 2020 
due to lockdown s, and stay -at-home restrictions meant the market for outdoor advertising was 
much affected. Linear TV  advertising spend also suffered, falling 13%.44 
The 2021 recovery picture was mixed: some sectors rebo unded fully, with higher spend even than 
2019; others appear to have a longer road to recovery. Cinema spend rose but  was still significantly 
less than  in 2019 (£103m compared to £299m); similarly , the badly affected  out-of-home sector was 
worth £901m in 2021 compared to £1.3bn in 2019. The numbers reflect the continued Covid -19-
related restrictions  during  the first half of 2021, with people less able or less inclined to go out for 
entertainment and leisure purposes .

Only two  of the eight advertising sectors are healthier than they were in 2019: TV  and online. Online 
proved the most resilient in 2020, with expenditure rising by 7%. In 2021, it grew 41% to £23.5bn, 
driving the rise in overall advertising spend across all sectors  and accounting for 83% of the total 
market growth. Excluding search and social in-feed advertising,45 online expenditure amount ed to 
£8.7bn in 2021, 40% higher in 2020. TV ad spend, at £4.7bn, also increased significantly from 2020’s 
£3.9bn, up by 22%. But TV’s share of the overall advertising market continues to decline,  reducing to 
15% in 2021 compared to 16% in 2020 and 26% in 2011. Spot advertising ( commercial breaks 
between TV programmes ) is the largest component of TV spend  and drove this recovery.

 Figure 25: UK advertising expenditure for selected segments: 2016 -2021

The growth in TV advertising was partly the result of advertisers be ing prepared to spend more to 
target hard -to-reach y ounger audiences . As linear TV viewing has declined for this demographic, the 
remaining advertising inventory which can deliver younger audi ences has inflat ed in cost, with  the 
price of  CPMs (cost per 1,000 views) for younger viewers increasing steeply . It remains to be seen 
whether  CPMs could become prohibitively expensive for advertisers , particularly those targeting  
younger audiences, or if , because TV’s reach is still the highest available on any platform, even 
higher CPMs are viable . 
Additional uncertainty for TV advertising comes with the prospect of a potential economic slowdown 
or recession in late 2022 or 2023, which would leave commercial broadcasters vulnerable to 
reductions in ad s pend, in turn putting revenue growth at risk.46 
Advertising spend on BVoD has continued to rise. Although  still relatively small compared to 
advertising for TV, B VoD advertising, such as th at on ITV Hub  and All 4 , has grown consistently, even 
through out the pandemic, reaching £733m in 2021. As a result, it is growing in importance for the TV  
advertising market. However, it is also operating in a competitive environment  – BVoD providers are 
seeking to attract viewers who are also likely to be users of SVoD services like Netflix and ad -
supported social video  services like YouTube. This competition will soon intensify  further ; several 
SVoD services are moving into ad -supported tiers  (see Figure 27 in the next section) , meaning that 
advertisers will have even more options for reaching TV and video audiences . 
The significant growth in online advertising spend in 2021 was largely driven by growth for social in -
feed video, spend on which increased by 45 % to £3.2bn. Meanwhile, s pend on in -stream video 
(advertising within video , such as the skippable advertising before YouTube content ) grew by 75% to 
£2.2bn. The growth for both in -stream and in -feed video reflects the still- increasing popularity of 
social video, but also the increasing unit price of advertising on these services. Advertisers have reported soaring CPMs on services such as Facebook and particularly TikTok, whose newness  on the

Another strong year of revenue growth for SVoD  
Following a  bumper 2020, the SVoD sector sustained strong revenue growth in 2021, generating an 
estimated £2.7bn in the year, with year- on-year growth of 27% only marginally lower than in 2020 
(28%). The top three services – Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ – had a market share of 
89% and accounted for 87% of the £566m increase in the year. Market leader Netflix, which raised 
prices in January 2021, increased its revenue by 21% to £1.4bn, a bout  double the amount Amazon 
Prime Video was estimated to have generate d (£713m). Third -placed Disney+ , which also raised its 
prices in early 2021, generated £277m in revenue in its second year of operation, compared to a 
little less than half that figure in just over nine months of operation in 2020 .48 Sky’s NOW saw more 
modest growth of 2%, to £214m.

Although revenue growth has been healthy, achievi ng subscriber growth is becoming increasingly 
challenging, putting pressure on providers to maximise the value of their users 
Increasing numbers of su bscribers , as well as price rises , drove SVoD revenue growth in 2021. 
However, as discussed in the previous chapter, SVoD household growth slowed in 2021 and there 
was a decline in Q2 2022, signalling a maturation of the market  that was compounded by sharp 
increases in the cost of living. Netflix reported two consecutive quarters of customer losses in its

 global subscriber base in the first half of 2022 – down  by 1.2 million over the period, to 220.7 
million. This was in part a result of Netflix’s exit from Russia , following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 
resulting in the loss of about 700,000 subscribers in Q1 and an overall decline of 203,000; but the 
decline of 969,000 in Q2 was the result of slow customer acquisition and the impact of price 
changes , as well as some typical seasonality. Th e company forecasted a return to growth in Q3 
2022.49 
In the UK, as the number of households yet to try SVoD  becomes  smaller and harder to convert, a 
slowdown in growth is natural, particularly for Netflix, which has already achieved significant 
penetratio n. Newer entrants seeking subscription growth in what is a highly competitive market are 
primarily relying on appealing to households that already use other SVoD services. Disney+ has been the most successful, firmly establishing itself in a significant number of homes that subscribe to 
Netflix and/or Amazon Prime Video. The likes of Apple TV+, Discovery+ and now Paramount+, which 
launched in the UK in June 2022 with original series including Star Trek , Yellowstone  and Halo,  are 
also vying to be one of seve ral services used in SVoD households. Bundling has been a key strategy 
for achieving scale quickly for these services,
50 with Paramount+ following the trend by launching in 
partnership with Sky and making its £6.99-a-month service available to Sky Cinema customers at no 
extra cost.  
In a bid to drive continued revenue growth in the face of fewer subscriber additions and growing 
competition , one strategy has been to raise prices. In April 2022, Netflix increased the monthly price 
of its Basic and Standar d tiers  each  by £1 (t o £6.99 and £10 .99, respectively) and its Premi um tier by 
£2 (to £15.99) . Amazon , meanwhile,  announced in July 2022 that it would raise the monthly price of 
Prime (the service that  includes a Prime Video subscription) by £1 to £8.99 in September 2022, 
having implemented an increase in the US (of $2, or about  £1.65) earlier in t he year. Sky raised the 
price of its NOW Boost add -on51 by £2 in July 2021. Price increases run the risk of increasing 
customer churn, particularly as the cost of living increases and household spend becomes tighter – 
but such customer losses may be more t han offset by the increased revenue from those who  
continue to subscribe, as indicated by Netflix’s increase in global revenue in both Q1 and Q2 2022 
despite reduced subscriber numbers .52 
Advertising is set to become a key component of SVoD  services, as business models shift from 
pure subscription  
The maturing market has prompted SVoD providers  to look at new ways of  generat ing revenue. In a 
significant step-change  from the original ad -free  SVoD proposition, an increasing number of  services 
are starting to incorporate  advertising into their offerings. Meanwhile, one of the major advertising-
led services, ITV Hub, is being integrated with ITV’s subscription services ITV Hub+ and BritBox to 
form a new service, ITVX. The result of these developments is an increasing number of streaming 
providers adopting hybrid business models for either ‘freemium’ or tiered propositions.

Gaming, release-schedule experimentation, and account -sharing crackdowns are focus areas  
In other revenue diversification moves, mobile games are providing an expansion opportunity for 
tech companies operating in adjacent sectors. Gaming rose in popularity during the pandemic and 
sustained this into 2021, with 60% of UK adults aged 16+ and 91% of 3-15-year-olds stating that they 
played games on consoles , desktop s or smartphone devices , either on or offline.53 In November 
2021, Netflix became the largest gaming subscription service when it made several mobile games accessible to all customers at  no extra cost. This model differs to Apple’s direct monetisation of its 
(more comprehensive) Apple Arcade subscription service, launched in 2019.

 Figure 28: Mobile video games produced by Netflix

Netflix’s gaming expansion has been supported by its acquisition of three small gaming studios ,54 
and by August 2022 it had produced 2 6 mobile games, with a target of a total of 50 games to be 
available by the end of 2022. Some titles are intended as tie -ins with popular Netflix series – 
Stranger Things: 1984, for example, is one of two games made for the franchise, and features the 
series’ characters in a nostalgic design reminiscent of vintage arcade games. Exploding Kittens , based 
on a popular card game,  was released in April 2022 , and a TV series will follow . Netflix has also made 
standalone casual games Card Blast  and Teeter Up . 
Ofcom’s VoD  Survey, conducted in February 2022, found that 54% of people aged 13+ who ha d used 
Netflix in the past three months were  aware that Netflix offers games, while 8% ha d played a Netflix 
game, and 5% said they ha d played one of the Stranger Things  games .55 While use of these games is 
low, the awareness of Netflix’s entry into casual g ames, among more than half of Netflix users , 
indicates that the company  has achieved some success in promoting them, and this could lead  to 
more users playing them . 
Experimenting with release schedules as a customer retention strategy has become a feature of 
several streaming services. Disney+ now releases new original series in the manner of a linear 
broadcaster, with weekly episodes , rather than making all of them available at  once. Amazon has 
announced that its marquee, big- budget  series Lord of the Ring s: Rings of Power  will also be released 
episode-by -episode, following its use of the same strategy for dark superhero -themed original series 
The Boys . 
Netflix, the founder of the ‘binge watch’ release model, has also experimented with this format. Original programmes  with weekly releases included  feature film series Fear St  and season four  of

 reality show The Circle , while marquee original series Ozark  (season four) and Stranger Things  
(season four) were  released in two parts  (Ozark  three months apart and Stranger Things  five weeks 
apart ). Netflix has also been varying the day of release for its most anticipated films, from the usual 
Friday (just as a film would be released in cinemas) to Wednesdays. Originated feature films such as 
Enola Holmes , The Boys In The Band  and Operation Mincemeat  all had midweek release s. 
As highlighted in the previous chapter, some users of the three most popular SVoD services access 
them through logins belonging to someone they do not live with, representing a potential source of untapped revenue. Netflix is seeking to address this, claiming that there are more than 100 million households worldwide that are using its service but not paying directly for  it. It has been 
experimenting with solutions in some of its Latin America markets – ‘add an extra member’,
56 ‘add a 
home’,57 and ‘transfer profile to a new account’ – all with additional fees. According to our VoD 
Survey, 14% of households using Netflix in the UK access the service via an account registered at a 
different address  (see previous chapter for additional commentary on SVoD account sharing) .58 If all 
these users were converted to paying members, that could equate t o a UK subscriber increase of 
more than two  million – but a proportion of these users would probably  choose  to lose access rather 
than start paying to keep using Netflix.  
Originals are more important than ever, but require significant and potentially risky levels of 
investment  
There are other knock -on effects of the maturing SVoD market  that could affect broadcasters and 
producers. As commissioners, there is pressure on SVoD providers to be more creative and 
innovative than ever, striving for must-see origina ls that drive customers  to keep subscribing. The 
volume of originals and exclusives available on major SVoD services has continued to rise, up 22% in the year to April 2022 to a total of 22,685 hours . Netflix, by far the largest contributor to originated 
hours, increased its volume  of originations by 33% (or 2,613 hours) over this period,  with every 
other major platform also increas ing their  original s output . People in the UK tend to prefer watching 
UK originals, as shown by these programmes’ prevalence in the top -ten most -watched lists.
59 SVoD 
providers continue to cater to this, with the volume of UK- produced original series and films on the 
service rising t o 1,398 hours in April 2022, a 20% year -on-year increase .60

Ramping up production will need to come with tightly -controlled costs if services are to be profitable 
in a more competitive market.  Netflix has said that the rate of growth in its content spend will 
reduce in the years to come.61 Investor concern over high  levels of content spend is becoming more 
evident and was seen as a driver for Paramount Global’s recent stock price slide.62 Pressure on 
budgets also has the potential to hit production firms  commissioned to make originals . 
The role of licensed content in  SVoD providers’ catalogues has the potential to change. Desirable 
acquisitions are becoming less available, as studios/broadcasters reclaim exclusivity of their 
intellectual property for their own services (e.g . Disney+ and Paramount+). Licensed content – 
particularly non-exclusive acquisitions that are carried on multiple SVoD services – could also be less 
appealing, given the increasing focus on originals, which are the primary focus of budgets. There are some indications of diminishing volumes of licen sed content in SVoD providers’ catalogues ; 
following years of growth, the size of Amazon Prime Video’s catalogue fell from 47,000 hours to 
30,000 between April 2021 and April 2022, while Netflix’s total hours has fallen slightly  (down 2% 
year on year). Desp ite increases for some other services (including Disney+, NOW and BritBox), 
overall content hours available across the seven leading services
63 fell from 130,000 to 119,000 over 
the period.

 Pay TV and connected TV  
Pay-TV operators are advancing their content aggregation strategies with new connected -TV 
products  
Despite a good recovery following 2020’s revenue declines, growth in traditional pay -TV revenue has 
been relatively flat for the past five years (see Figure 23 above). The sector  continues to co me under 
pressure from the rise of SVoD services, available on a flexible basis : pay-TV households fell to just 
under 12.7 million in Q1 2022, having declined by 2 .2 million since 2016. More than three -quarters 
(78%) of pay -TV homes also have a subscriptio n to at least one SVoD service, with this significant 
overlap prompting operators to integrate SVoD services into their offerings in a bid to preserve their 
traditional position as aggregators  of all the most popular content and services . 
Figure 30: UK subscription TV and free -to-air households (m illions ): Q1 2016 – Q1 2022 
 
Source: BARB Establishment Survey . ‘Digital terrestrial only’ refers to homes that receive TV through an aerial 
only and not through an internet connection. ‘ All other  households ’ refers to  those using other  free TV 
platforms/services  (e.g. Freesat or through an internet connection) without pay  TV or SVoD , as well as  
households with no  TV reception and no SVoD.  Fieldwork for the BARB Establishment Survey was not conducted 
in Q1 2021 due to Covid -19 restrictions, which is why Q2 2021 data has been used instead.  
The most recent evidence of this is the launch of new connected -TV products by Sky and Virgin 
Media, both designed to better integrate pay-TV channels with on -demand programming from both 
SVoD providers and broadcasters.  
Sky, building on an SVoD aggregation model  that has seen it secure carriage of all the major 
streaming services,64 launched its own smart TV  set, Sky Gla ss, in October 2021 . Positioned as a ‘no 
fuss’ option for premium TV, it provides access to almost  the full Sky TV offering over IP, alongside 
SVoD and BVoD content, without the need for a satellite dish, set- top box or long -term service 
contract. To appea l to those who do not want to buy a new TV set, Sky is also planning to sell 
standalone versions of its Sky Stream ‘p ucks’  – small streaming  boxes initially sold as part of a Sky

Virgin Media, meanwhile,  launched its own new streaming box, Stream, in April 2022. Available to 
Virgin Media broadband customers, the device provides flexible, integrated access to pay -TV, SVoD 
and BVoD content, with discounts on SVoD subscriptions offered in the form of 10% credit back. 
By seeking to reassert themselves as one-stop shops for pay and free linear and on -demand content 
that can be accessed in intuitive ways and via a single bill, the operat ors may  improve their 
prospects of creating a virtuous circle of customer satisfaction, strong relationships and 
advantageous carriage deals with third -party apps, and better user interfaces with ever -growing 
options. 
The use of connected -TV devices is com monplace, creating opportunities for other companies 
seeking to play the role of content aggregator  
Pay-TV operators ’ pursuit of connected -TV strategies comes against the backdrop of widespread 
consumer use of devices other than their set -top boxes to watch online content on TV sets. More 
than half of adults (52%) surveyed in February 2022 said that they used apps or services on a smart 
TV for this purpose, while 28% said they used a streaming box. This compares to a third (33%) who  
said they used a set -top box.66 Among streaming box or stick users, Amazon Fire TV was the most 
popular product, used by 68%. This was followed by Google Chromecast, used by 17%.67

 Amazon and Google – which provides its Android TV software to many smart TV manufacturers – 
well-placed to compete with  pay-TV operators to play the role of content aggregators themselves. If 
they can succe ed in this, they will be better -placed to forge direct customer relationships with TV 
viewers, thereby supporting adjacent businesses such as subscription services or ad vertising. 
Premium sport remains a cornerstone of pay -TV offerings  
The rise of SVoD has, as discussed, put pressure on both linear TV viewing and pay -TV subscriptions. 
Dedicated sports channels, which have long been a key component of pay TV, have proved m ore 
resilient than TV overall to declines in audiences . Between 2011 and 2021, average reach for total 
broadcast TV declined from 95% to 86%, while sports channels’ reach stayed flat, at 19%. But  among 
16-34-year-olds , who are abandoning broadcast TV faster than average , sports channels’ reach fell 
from 20% to 15% over the ten -year period.

But for many audiences, m arquee sporting events are still appointment viewing. Sky Sports recorded 
its highest -ever daily viewing figures on a day in October 2021 when it aired Premier League football 
(Manchester United vs Liverpool), Formula One motor racing ( the USA Grand Prix) and T20 World 
Cup cricket (India vs Pakistan) . It had  an average of 1.2 million viewers across the day, peaking at 4.5 
million, with overall reach exceeding 8 million.68 
Sports rights , therefore, remain highly valuable, particularly to pay -TV providers, which have 
retained the majority of the most desirable rights in the face of emerging competition from the likes 
of Amazon and DAZN. Alt hough still expensive following an escalation in the cost of rights when BT 
entered the sports broadcasting market in 2012, programming costs have stayed broadly static for

 the past few years. Although spending dropped steeply  in 2020 ( -17%), caused by the widespread 
shutdown of sporting events and live b roadcasts, it recovered ( by 26%) in 2021. Spend on the single 
most valuable sports commodity, FA Premier League rights, will remain flat for three years from the 
2022-23 season, following an agreement between the Premier League and its existing rights holders, 
Sky, BT and Amazon, to roll over the preceding £ 4.7bn rights deal. The move, which required 
approval by the Government, was made amid uncertainty caused by Covid -19 and to ensure stable 
funding from rights for football clubs suffering financially as a  result of the pandemic.

BT Sport and Eurosport have combine d for a renewed premium  sport s push 
Sustaining heavy investment in sports broadcasting can be challenging for operators. BT, seeking a 
renewed growth strategy for BT Sport, began speaking to companies interested in the asset in 2021. 
In May 2022, these discussions resulted in the formation of a strategic partnership with Warner 
Bros. Discovery, owner of Eurosport, to create a 50:50 joint venture combining the two companies’ respective sports businesses.
69 Retaining their separate brands initially, BT Sport and Eurosport will 
ultimately be bro ught together under a single brand.  In the meantime, BT Sport subscribers will gain 
access to  streaming service D iscovery+, which includes access to Eurosport and its coverage of 
events including the Olympic Games, Grand Slam tennis (Australian Open and French Open) and cycling Grand Tours. Subscribers to  the joint offering will also have access to most live Champions 
League football matches until at least 2027, with BT securing a new rights deal in July 2022.
70 
The joint  venture generates revenue for BT – an initial £93m from Warner Bros. Discovery and up to 
approximately £540m if performance targets are met – while spreading future rights and production

 costs. The deal was investigated by CMA, which considered whether it would create a “substantial 
lessening of competition” , but cleared  it for completion in July 2022.  
The partnership between BT and Warner Bros. Discovery serves to strengthen the two companies’ 
market position , as streaming players emerge as new competitors for sports rights. SVoD spending 
on UK sports rights remains small, at  £75m  in 2021 ( 2% of total  UK sports -rights spend) , but various 
streaming players are increasing their foothold in sports. For instance, Amazon  Prime Video has a 
presence in the market with a small amount of Premier League football rights, which it has held 
since 2019, as well as regular tennis coverage, including rights to the US Open. It will also, in a significant expansion of its football offering, begin airing weekly Champions League football, having 
secured a share of the rights for the 2024-27 period.
71 
Meanwhile, sports specialist SVoD service DAZN , which has acquired mainstream sports rights in 
some major international markets but currently offers a niche, boxing-led service in the UK , had 
been one of the potential buyers for BT Sport, before talks broke down and BT entered into 
exclusive negotiations with Warner Bros. Discovery. The acquisition would have supported DAZN’s 
ambitions to become a significant player in the UK sports landscape. Elsewhere, Apple TV+ has made 
significant inroads into US sports with Major League Baseball Friday night matches and a global deal 
to show  Major League Soccer . While these sports are less popular in the UK, the move signals the 
ambition and ca pability of another streaming service to compete for sports rights . 
Another new player is set to enter the sports streaming market in late 2022 ; Viaplay is preparing to 
launch in the UK, having boosted its prospects with the acquisition of Premier Sports in July 2022.72 
Multichannel spending rebounded from 2020, but remains lower than pre -pandemic  
Overall multichannel spending on sport s and other genres recovered in 2021 compared to 2020, 
rising 8% to £4. 8bn. However, spending was  still down compared to 2019, at 4 % less than that year’s 
total (just under £5bn). The three highest -spend genres all reduced over the two -year period ; sports 
and entertainment fell by 2% and 3% respectively, while the larger drop in films spend was in par t 
due to  Disney ending its supply deal with Sky Cinema as part of the switch to the Disney+ SVoD 
strategy.  
Only factual and news programming saw growth in 2021 compared to 2019. Factual spend is now at 
its highest level in ten  years, at £112m, partially du e to new Sky channel launches (Sky 
Documentaries and Sky Nature). Factual programming, with its lower per -hour cost compared to 
entertainment  and its fast turnaround to air, may be  becoming a more viable option for 
multichannel schedules as they continue to recover from pandemic losses.

Product ion sector trends 
Financial challenges amid production boom  
The independent production sector has shown  signs of recovery from the disruption caused by the 
pandemic. According to producers’ association Pact, producer revenues rose to £3.25bn  in 2021; this 
was close to 2019 levels, when revenues tota lled £3.33bn, and represents 7% growth compared to 
2020.  
The sector appears to be recovering at a slightly slower pace than, for instance, the advertising 
market (as discussed above), and there are signs of a slowdown in some of its composite parts. For 
instance, there was a further decline in international TV revenue, a segment that covers commissions to UK production companies by foreign broadcasters and streaming services as well as 
licens ing of finished programmes. This segment had been growing steadily  since 2011, but its value 
declined by 13% in 2021, to £952m. Production has stayed slow as the Covid -19 recovery continues , 
and the conclusion or absence of some major UK productions, such as Netflix’s big-budget series The 
Crown (which took an extended filming break after season four) has also been a factor. Meanwhile, 
UK TV revenues, i.e. commissions and sales from UK broadcaste rs, rebounded by 30% to a record

The broader production sector is facing a series of challenges. Although business from UK 
broadcasters is booming, there are still cost pressures. Broadcast ’s 2022 Indie Survey respondents 
continued to  find that their  production budgets were being affected by Covid -19; 92% of indies 
reported that their costs were higher,  by between 10 % and 25% of their pre -pandemic levels, even 
though restrictions on filming had been  relaxed by the end of 2021.  Close to  half of respond ents 
reported that their production costs were higher than in 2020. 73 
National price inflation, Covid -19 prevention measures  and a shortage of skilled crew pose 
significant challenges . Inflation is likely to lead to real-term price increases in everything  from 
camera hire to catering. Hiring skilled crew has been a major issue since the pandemic, as 
freelancers have left  the industry and there is a slower pipeline of skilled new starters .74 Covid -19 
management, including safety measures and increased backu p should talent or crew fall ill, is also a 
significant cost. Having formerly been supported by the Government’s Film & TV Production Restart 
Scheme,75 more of these costs will now be  shouldered  by broadcasters and production companies.  
The result is additional price pressures  on production companies, which could result in significant  
financial challenges  for the smallest and most vulnerable of them. As well as potentially reducing the 
number of small companies in existence, this could accelerate the trend towards production 
company consolidation, with conglomerates of production companies or large broadcaster -content 
producers buying up struggling firms . 
Foreign and domestic investment boost production  in the high -end TV sector  
More than  two years since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the high -end TV76 production 
sector is more active  than ever. A strong Q3 and Q4 bounce- back in 2020 led to  a historic high across

 all types of high -end TV production in 2021. There were 211 productions, up from 116 in 2020 and 
the highest number since the high -end TV tax credit was introduced in 2013. Domestic productions 
were up to 94 (from 50): these included Derry Girls  season  three  and Worzel Gummidge  season  2. 
Inward (i.e. foreign) investment was an even bigger driver of growth, rising to 117 productions from 
66 the previous year: these included programmes such as Good Omens  season 2 and Outlander  
season 6. The strong international numbers for high -end TV content, which identify the content at 
the early point of production rather than at the point of revenue accounting, may predict a future 
boost to these producer revenues, which as shown in Figure 35 above, declined in 2021 . 
In addition, 2021 was a strong year for film -length, long-form SVo D productions ,77 which rose from 
19 to 36. Some of the record increases over the past year can be attributed to productions delayed from 2020, but the five -year trend  shows that  high- end TV is still growing, and long-form 
productions increased even during the pandemic, rising by three in 2020 and by 17 in 2021.

Consolidation continues with new mergers and acquisitions  
The UK production sector has been a busy space for mergers and acquisitions for many years. In 2021 and early 2022, this pattern continued, including deals for producers speciali sing in both 
scripte d and unscripted programming . 
In June 2022, ITV spent £104m to acquire a majority stake in major unscripted producer Plimsoll 
Pictures, which produces natural history programming such as Tiny World  for AppleTV+ and Night on 
Earth  for Netflix. The move indicates that this kind of premium unscripted programming is a draw for 
audiences in an SVoD marketplace crowded with options. It is also versatile, as it can be easily adapted for international markets with the narration in different languages.  
 
77 These are ‘SVoD films’, made for streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video which apply for certification

 Several scrip ted production companies also received investments from other larger producers and 
broadcasters, reflecting the TV production market’s continued interest in drama and the executives 
who can bring it to the screen. Some examples featuring UK talent included Sony Pictures 
Television’s acquisition of a majority stake in UK drama brand Bad Wolf; BBC Studios’ investment in House Productions, the maker of Sherwood ; and Fremantle’s acquisition of a controlling stake in The

 Public service broadcasting  
Introduction: legislative reforms are proposed to safeguard the 
future of public service broadcasting in the UK  
In July 2021, Ofcom made recommendations to Government on the future of the public service 
media (PSM) system for the next decade. The recommendations marked the conclusion of Ofcom’s 
Small Screen: Big Debate , an in -depth review of the future of PSM.  
The Government recently set out its vision for the broadcasting sector  in a White Paper ahead of a 
Media Bill. Among other things, the White P aper explained the Government’s intention to 
implement some of the key recommendations of our Small Screen: Big Debate review. These include 
a simplified PSB remit, a new prominence regime for PSB online services on the major connected  TV 
platforms , and greater  flexibility for PSBs in how they deliver their obligations , including through 
their online services.  
This chapter provides an update on key data relating to PSM, including trends in audience viewing, changes in the amount of  reve nue generated by the PSBs, and  data on programme output and 
investment. It also provides an overview of the findings from Ofcom’s proprietary PSM Tracker, examining audience perceptions of, and satisfaction with, public service media.  
What is public service broadcasting?  
Public service broadcasting (PSB) is an intervention, designed by Parliament, to ensure that UK audiences can enjoy a wide range of high -quality TV  programmes that meet people’s needs and 
interests as citizens and individuals. The pub lic service broadcasters are the BBC, S4C, the providers 
of the Channel 3 services (ITV, and STV in Scotland), Channel 4 Corporation (‘C4C’) and the provider 
of Channel 5 (owned by Paramount).  
Under the current framework, specified PSB channels  must collec tively fulfil certain statutory 
purposes and individually meet a set of service-specific requirements.
78 When  describ ing the public 
service channels taken together, the term public service broadcasting (PSB) is used. The term ‘public 
service media ’ is a broad er term which was used in Ofcom’s review, Small Screen: Big Debate , to 
reflect the fact that audiences are no longer limited to ‘broadcast’ channels and may watch content from the public service broadcasters on a range of broadcast and online services.
79 
Under the current legislative framework, the  PSB channels are : all the BBC’s public broadcast TV 
services, each Channel 3 service (ITV’s main channel80 in England, Wales and Norther n Ireland and 
 
78 See Annex 8. PSB regulatory framework  regarding the PSB regulatory Framework, including the PSB remits and the 
service- specific requireme nts for the individual PSB providers.  
79 During our Small Screen: Big Debate  review, several respondents questioned the concept and scope of public service 
media and suggested  it should  be clearly defined in legislation. We agreed with the need for clarity and considered ‘PSM’ 
as the best way to describe public service content delivered through a range of platforms including broadcast TV and 
online services.

 STV in Scotland), Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C. The PSB channels are all for public benefit, so are 
available to all and are free at the point of delivery, without subscription or contract.  
The BBC is currently primarily funded by the licence fee. A standard licence fee, currently costing 
£159 per year , is required to watch live programmes on any broadcast channel, as well as to 
download or watch any BBC programmes on BBC iPlayer. The other PSB channels are primarily 
funded through advertisin g, and all PSB channels receive regulatory benefits in the form of 
privileged access to spectrum and a prominent position within electronic programme guides (EPGs). 
PSB viewing trends  
Growth in viewing of PSB on-demand services has not been enough to fully  
offset the larger decline in viewing of  linear broadcast PSB channels  
As outlined in the first chapter of this report, the average amount of time spent watching TV from 
broadcasters has been in steady decline over the last decade, as audiences have increasingly chosen 
to subscribe to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, as well as spend more time on social video platforms, in particular YouTube. The trends seen in general consumption of 
broadcast TV over the last decade have been broadly  reflected in audience viewing of PSB channels 
and services. Although PSBs have managed to increase viewing on their BVoD services  (e.g. BBC 
iPlayer, ITV Hub and All 4 ), this has not been enough to compensate for the larger decline in viewing 
of their linear TV channels.

 The increase in viewing of  PSB channels during the pandemic has not been 
sustained, falling below pre -pandemic levels in 2021  
In 2020, PSB channels bucked the overall downward trend in linear TV viewing seen in recent years, 
with the average amount of time spent watching PSB channels increasing by seven minutes per day, 
driven mainly by an increase in viewing of news programming during the Covid -19 pandemic.  
However, the main five PSB channels  saw either a drop or no change in their average minutes of 
daily viewing in 2021, and the long -term decline , interrupted by the anomalous 2020 , resumed. 
Collectively, viewing of PSB channels such as BBC One and ITV fell to 1 hour 42 minutes per person 
per day, down two minutes compared to 2019, while the associated commercial portfolio channels 
(such as ITV2 and  E4) together declined to 25 minutes (down by three  minutes). Viewing of 
multichannels (such as Sky -branded channels, UKTV and Discovery) collectively reduced to 53 daily 
minutes (down  by four  minutes) . 
Despite the general decline in viewing over the last decade, PSB channels continue to represent the 
majority of daily viewing of broadcast TV, at  57% in 2021, a proportion that has remained relatively 
stable, ranging between 59% and 55% since 2011.

The decline in viewing of PSB channels has been across all age  groups, but is 
most pronounced among younger audiences 
Following the increase in 2020, viewing  of PSB channels decreased across all age groups in 2021, 
with every cohort seeing a drop in the average number of minutes watched per day. 
The trend of declining viewing of PSB channels is particularly prominent among younger audiences. 
For 16-24-year-olds, there was a 52-minute decline in daily TV viewing between 2011 and 2021 (to 144140

 just 26 minutes a day), while for 25-34-year-olds  there was a 54-minute d ecline over the same 
period (to 46 minutes a day). 
PSBs have been attempting to attract younger audiences through various initiatives, with B VoD 
services central to their future strategies. Recent moves and announcements  in this area , such as 
ITV’s planned launch of ITVX , its revamped on-demand and streaming offering,  are discussed later in 
this chapter.  
On broadcast TV, the BBC re-launched BBC Three as a linear channel in February 2022. The youth-
orientated channel was , as a cost-saving measure , closed in March 2016 and made available only 
online via BBC iPlayer. An assessment of the impact of the re -launched BBC Three linear channel will 
be included in Ofcom’s next annual report on the BBC in autumn 2022. 
Among children aged 4-15, viewing of  PSB channels also declined further in 2021, with this cohort 
watching 25 minutes per day, compared to 31 minutes in 2019  (before the pandemic) and 1 hour 9 
minutes in 2011. In May 2022, the BBC announced proposals  to stop airing CBBC , as w ell as BBC 
Four , as a linear broadcast channel within three years , and to make it available online only via BBC 
iPlayer , which the BBC has sought to make appealing and user -friendly to children, with features 
such as child profiles that tailor the experience based on the age of the child user. Figure 39: Average daily minutes of PSB channels viewing per person, by age: 2011-2021

Weekly reach of PSB channels among 16 -24s has fallen below 50% for the 
first time  
While the pandemic drove an increase in daily viewing of the PSB channels in 2020, there was no 
corresponding uplift in weekly reach.81 Among all individuals, weekly reach of the PSB channels 
declined from 80% in 2019 to 79% in 2020, with a further decline to 76% in 2021.

 As with daily viewing, the decline in weekly reach of the PSB channels has been mo st apparent 
among younger audiences. Among 16 -24-year-olds it declined further in 2021 and now stands at less 
than half (47%) of this age  group for the first time. Similarly, only a bout half (53%) of children aged 
4-15 now watch at least 15 consecutive min utes of the PSB channels in an average week.  
The decline in weekly reach of the PSB channels is not limited to younger audiences ; weekly reach 
among people aged 35 -44 and 45-5 4 has been declining more gradually over the last three years. 
Audiences aged 55  and older  (a growing segment among the population in general ) are the only 
cohort where there has not been a significant decline in weekly reach , both year  on year and over a 
longer period.

or more in an average week. Data consolidated up to 28 days.  
There has been a decline in weekly reach for a ll the individual PSB channels  
All the individual PSB channels have been affected by the general  decline in viewing  of linear TV, 
although to varying degrees. BBC One and ITV have had the largest falls in weekly reach , both 
declining ten  percentage points since 2012 to 6 2% and 4 8% respectively in 2021. BBC Two and 
Channel 4 have seen their weekly reach decline by eight  and six percentage points respectively over 
the same period, to 39 % and 3 8%. Although Channel 5 has also had  a decline in weekly reach since 
2012 – down five percentage points to 30% – its reach has been more stable than the other PSB 
channels. This  may be due in part to an increase in investment in original content following the 
acquisition of Channel 5 by Paramount (formerly ViacomCBS) in 2014.  
Weekly reach of the commercial PSB portf olio channels (e.g. ITV2 and E4) – which are not ‘PSB 
channels’ but are included here for comparison – was 48% in 2021, down 14 percentage points since

Enterta inment, factual and n ews programming are the most -watched genres 
on PSB channels  
Figure 42 below illustrates how viewing of the PSB channels was split between different programme 
genres in 2021, with a comparison of all individuals and 16-24s -year-olds. Among all individuals, 
entertainment (24.9% of viewing time) was the most-watched genre as a propor tion of total viewing 
minutes, followed by general factual (16.7%), news and current affairs programming (13.7%) and 
sports (10.5%).  
Among 16 -24s, the top four genres watched on PSB are the same as among all individuals, although 
the extent to which each genre is watched is different. For example,  while 13.7% of the time spent 
viewing PSB channels , among all individuals , is to news and current affairs programming, this falls to 
8.3% among 16-24s. This is probably because younger audiences are increasingly getting a higher 
proportion of their news content from online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as news websites and apps, rather than via broadcast TV news.
82 Younger audiences also spend 
a higher proportion of their viewing ti me (28.9%) watching entertainment programmes on PSB 
channels, as well as sport (15.8%) , compared to all individuals. Smaller genres – such as education, 
religion and arts programming – each account for less than 1% of total viewing among all individuals 
and younger audiences.

VoD services are central to the PSBs’ strategies and are critical to driving 
future viewing and revenue  
On-demand streaming services now form an integral part of the PSBs’ strategies. To make their 
services more competitive and appealing to audiences , PSBs have been including more ‘ box sets ’, 
thereby  extending the window (or  period of time)  when content is available, as well as  improving 
the functionality of these services. Consequently, there has been significant growth in viewing of the 
PSBs’ BVoD  servic es. Among all VoD services,84 BBC iPlayer was the second largest by streams85 in 
2021, and again broke its Q1 record with 1.83 billion streams in Q1 2022 – an increase of 100 million 
compared to Q1 2021 (1.7 billion).86 This puts it well ahead of other PSB BVoD services, as well as 
Amazon Prime Video,  although its volume of streams and rate of growth in recent years are well 
behind Netflix. The SVoD market leader delivered 20.1 billion streams in 2021, including a quarterly high of 5.6 billion in Q1 of that year (compared to 4.9 billion in Q1 2022).

Despite the popularity of PSB B VoD, the increase in viewing on  these services has not been enough 
to fully compensate for the decline in linear viewing, and PSBs are continu ing to invest in VoD 
services as they attempt to maintain revenues and compete for audiences with online streaming 
platforms.  
As part of its current strategic vision,87 ITV has made streaming one of its three critical priorities, 
with the objective of doubling digital revenues to at least £750m by 2026. Part of this strategy includes the launch of ITVX
88 – a new service that will consolidate and enhance ITV’s existing VoD 
services: ITV Hub, ITV Hub+, and BritBox, the UK version of which is now fully owned by ITV, after it 
bought out the BBC’s minority stake in the joint-venture.89 Due to launch in late 2022, ITVX will use a 
‘freemium’ model, with free and subscription tiers offered in a single service.  And in a departure 
from its traditional approach, ITV plans to adopt a digital -first content strategy where much of its 
new content will be shown first on ITVX, before being broadcast, potentially months later, on ITV 
linear broadcast channels. The revamped service will also benefit from higher content spend, more premieres and exclusives, and a bigger library of box -sets and films . 
PSBs are also seeking to reach audiences with VoD content distributed on alternative platforms, 
including social media/video services. In May 2022, Channel 4 announced an extension to its 
strategic partnership with YouTube.
90 The deal will enable  1,000 hours of full episodes of Channel 4 
(and E4) content to be available on YouTube, and will allow Channel 4 to sell its own advertising 
around these shows. The partnership is part of Channel 4’s strategy to accelerate digital growth, develop new revenue streams and reach younger audiences on the platforms they use.

 ITV, meanwhile,  announced content partnership deals with both Twitter and Snapchat  in the first 
half of 2022. These will enable highlights from sporting events (to which ITV hold s the broadcasting 
rights) such as the FIFA World Cup and Rugby World Cup 2022, to be made available on the social 
media platforms .92 In addition, short -form content made specially for mobile, from ITV programmes  
including I’m a Celebrity … and Love Island , will be created as part of the content deal with Snapchat.  
PSBs are also working to improv e the functionality of their on-demand services. For example, in its  
2022/23 annual plan, the BBC states that continuing to improve the user -experience of BBC iPlayer is 
a top priority for the year ahead.93 It will focus on  increased personalisation and improved content 
discovery, among other  improvements to the BBC iPlayer interface.  
More tha n half of online adults have used PSB BVoD services to watch TV 
programmes live at the time of broadcast  
While the PSBs’ streaming services are typically used to watch programmes on  demand, users can 
also stream channels and events live. The vast majority (82%) of online teens and adults are aware 
that they can use services such as BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub in this way,  with 59% of PSB B VoD service 
users using them to watch channels or programmes live at the time they are broadcast. BBC iPlayer 
is the most po pular BVoD platform for watching live TV at the time of broadcast, with 56% of online 
adults claiming to do this.94

 Audience attitudes and sentiment  
Overall, audiences are broadly satisfied with public service broadcasting  
Ofcom’s P ublic Service Media  Tracker is an ongoing research programme that measures audiences’ 
satisfaction with PSB and how well they think broadcasters are delivering on numerous different 
attributes.  
When asked to think about PSB channels overall, two -thirds (67%) of those who said they ha d 
viewed PSB services in the past six months said they were  satisfied with it; only 12% said they were 
dissatisfied. Men were more likely than women to be dissatisfied with PSBs (15% vs 10%). Despite 
the differences in consumption habits, levels of satisfaction wer e broadly consistent across age 
groups, although those aged 16 -34 were significantly more likely to describe themselves as very 
satisfied with PSBs overall (28% vs 23% overall).

News programming is considered one of the most important elements of PSB  
When respondents were asked to consider what are the most important elements of PSB to 
society ,95 trusted and accurate UK news was chosen as the most important (15%), followed by 
 
95 Our methodology used a MaxDiff approach , whereby consumers were asked to indicate the ‘ most important ’ and ‘least 
important ’ options in each of a series of 16 randomly generated sets of five  options. By using a ‘ trade -off’ approach, we  
can determine  relative importance scores for each attribute, adding u p to 100 overall.  This question was asked of all 
respondents who completed the survey online, excluding those who completed over the telephone.  
Media Nations 2022 
60 
 ‘programmes that help me understand what is going on in the world’  (11%) and ‘a wide range of 
different types of programmes, such as drama, comedy, entertainment or sport’  (11%). Elements of 
PSB relat ing to quality and range, and news and current affairs , made up over half of the most 
important elements.  
There was significant variation by demographics when looking at the importance t o audiences  of 
different PSB attributes . Older audiences found trusted and accurate UK news more important than  
did younger audiences, whil e younger audiences were more likely to place value on elements 
relat ed to relatability and diversity such as ‘programmes that feature people like me’  and 
‘programmes which feature people from different backgrounds’ . 
PSBs are highly valued for delivering a wide range of programming made for 
UK audiences  
For PSBs overall,  audiences generally considered most of the PSB attributes as being delivered well.96 
Among those who ha d used a PSB service in the past six months, PSBs were seen as delivering 
particularly well on ‘ programmes made for UK audiences’ , ‘a wide range of different types of 
programmes’ , ‘programmes that help me understand what is going on in the world today’,  and 
‘appeal[ing] to a wide range of different audiences’ . Given that ‘programmes made for UK audiences’  
is also one of the top-rated  statements at the  individual broadcaster level, it is clear that this is 
considered to be a important and  well-delivered element of PSB for UK viewers.  
Across several  statements, younger viewers were more likely than older viewers to say that PSBs are 
delivering well. For example, ‘ programmes that feature people like me ’ (56% of 16-34-year -olds 
rated 7 -10 vs 42% of 55+ -year -olds), ‘ programmes made for UK audiences ’ (72% vs 65%) and 
‘programmes tha t are different in their approach to other providers ’ (53% v s 44%).  
We also observed differences between socio -economic groups, with those in ABC1 households more 
positive than those in C2DE households across several  statements, including ‘ programmes that are 
relevant to me’  (62% vs 56%), ‘programmes that help me understand what is going on in the world 
today’  (67% vs 59%) and ‘programmes made for UK audiences ’ (72% vs 64%).

Looking at individual broadcasters, there were differences  in views  about the delivery of the various 
PSB attributes. The top attributes  on which BBC TV channels  were seen as delivering  well were  
providing ‘ programmes made for UK audiences’ , ‘programmes that help people to understand what 
is going on in the world today’, and ‘a wide range of different programmes’. ITV channels97 also d id 
well on providing ‘ programmes made for UK audiences ’ and ‘appeal[ing] to a wide range of 
audiences’ , as well as providing ‘ a wide range of ‘ different types of programmes , such as drama, 
comedy, entertainment or sport ’. Channel 4  TV channels  deliver ed well on distinctiveness, with 
elements such as ‘providing programmes different in their approach to other providers’ , and 
‘programmes that help me see things from a different angle/perspective’ rated well. 
Satisfaction with PSB BVoD services is high, especially among younger 
audiences 
Provision of PSB B VoD services was seen as important to audiences: three -quarters (73%) of UK 
adults said it was important to them, with only 7% seeing it as unimportant. The most popular 
reason for usin g PSB BVoD services is to ‘catch up on programmes missed on live TV ’ (63%); this is 
more likely among older than younger respondents. Other popular reasons include ‘ being able to 
watch what I want, when I want ’; ‘to watch specific programmes or box -sets’; and ‘ to access older or 
archive programmes ’.

A lack of interest in the available content is the main reason  people do not 
watch  PSB channels or use PSB  BVoD  services  
Among those who  had not watched specific PSB channels in the past six months, there was some 
variation in the reasons given for each channel, but in general the reasons most likely to be cited 
were related to the available programmes not being of interest. Other reasons given related to viewers not watching live TV and preferring other chan nels/services.

Financial performance and funding  
The resurgent advertising market fuel led a return to revenue growth for the 
commercial PSBs in 2021  
Commercial PSBs and digital multichannels both had  unprecedented dec lines in revenue in 2020 as a 
result of the Covid-19 pandemic. C ommercial PSBs ’ revenue  was impacted significantly by the sharp 
downturn in TV advertising, as many advertisers either cancelled or postponed their campaigns. 
However, the commercial PSBs benefited from a resurgence in the TV advertising market in 2021, 
which drove a £438m increase in t heir revenues, to £2.4bn.  
Despite the overall decline in audience viewing, advertisers continue to consider  linear broadcast TV 
the best way to reach a mass audience. ITV reported that  June 202 1 generated the largest monthly 
ad revenue in the company’s history. In addition to pent -up demand from advertisers followi ng the 
initial peak of the Covid -19 pandemic, ITV’s  June record was driven by the significant ad revenue 
generated during the Euro 2020 football tournament (which was postponed to 2021). The semi -final 
between England and Denmark was watched by 24  million people, with ITV reportedly charging up 
to £500,000 for a single 30 -second advertising spot.  
Channel 4 recovered strongly from the pandemic in 2021, generating £1.16bn in revenue in the year . 
This was  the first time the broadcaster ha d exceeded £1bn annual ly; it was  up 25% year on year, and  
up 18% on 2019.  While Channel 4  is still heavily reliant on linear TV advertising as its main source of 
income, its digital revenues have been growing steadily over the p ast few years in line with its Future 
4 strategy ,98 which prioritises growth of digital audiences and digital revenues. Compared with 2019, 
Channel 4’s spot advertising revenue grew by 8% to £835m , whil e digital advertising revenue 
increased by 37% to £224m.99 
Following a consultation  in 2021, the Government has set out its view that Channel 4’s current 
public ownership model is constraining its ability to respond to the challenges and opportunities of 
the changing broadcast landscape. The White Paper confirmed its intention to legislate for a change 
of ownership for Channel 4. 
Although the BBC is not subject to the same financial vulnerabilities as advertising-funded 
broadcasters, pressure on licence fee income is posing funding challenges for the broadcaster. It has 
been impacted by the Government ’s decision to pass responsibility for TV licences for the over -75s

 to the BBC, with a proportion of them now funded by the BBC directly.  The number of TV licences 
sold (including to over -75s) has also decreased by 5.1% since 2017/18, from 26.2 million to 2 4.9 
million.100 In April 2020, the BBC announced that it would need to make savings of up to £125m as a 
result of the uncertainty created by the pandemic, as well as the ongoing pressures on the licence 
fee. It implemented several cost -saving measures, including a pay freeze for all employees and a 
pause on all recruitment for non -business -critical roles.  
In January 2022, the Government announced that the TV licence fee would be frozen at £159 until 
2024, before rising in line with inflation for the following four years.101 As a result, the BBC has 
estimated that it will need to make £285m in annual savings as of 2027/28.102 In May 2022, it 
announced £200m of cost saving measures, including the proposed clos ure of CBBC and BBC Four as 
broadcast channels within three years, although the content for these channels will continue to be 
produced and made available online via BBC iPlayer. The BBC’s two news channels (one for UK 
audiences and one for international  audiences) will be merged into a single channel, while Radio 4 
Extra will move online -only  via BBC Sounds.

Since 2016, digital advertising revenue ha s grown faster than traditional

Despite the resurgence in advertising revenue in 2021, linear TV  advertising continues to face 
pressures , including the possibility of advertiser s cutting back on TV ad spend in the event of a 
downturn in the UK economy  in late 2022 and 2023;103 furth er declines in audience viewing of

 YouTube has significantly increased the amount of advertising minutage on its platf orm, following 
the decision to change its monetisation rules and place video ads around all content,  not just 
content from creators in the YouTube partner programme. However,  while YouTube has a higher 
reach, especially among younger audiences, the amount of attention given by viewers to a YouTube 
ad is significantly lower than a traditional linear TV advert, especially as many ads on YouTube are 
skippable.  
Commercial PSBs have also successfully managed to capitalise on the growth in digital advertising , 
increasing ad revenues from BVoD services since 2016 . In that year, BVoD services generated £197m  
in revenue,  which increased to  £733m in 2021,  a compound annual growth rate of 30%. However, 
the growth in BVoD advertising has not been enough to fully compens ate for the decline in 
traditional linear ad revenue over the same period.  
BVoD advertising now accounts for 14% of TV advertising (excluding revenues from sponsorship and product placement) and is likely to grow .
104 To this end, commercial PSB s have been working hard to 
accelerate growth in BVoD advertising and attract more advertisers to the ir services. This includes 
improved cross -media measurement to better understand the incremental reach of BVoD 
advertising (for  example,  via the C Flight joint initiative between ITV, Channel 4 and Sky)  and 
investing in new technologies to enable advertisers to purchase BVoD ad space on an automated 
basis, as well as improving the targeting of adverts via addressable advertising.  
In addition, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA) has been working with the World 
Federation of Advertisers (WFA) on a new, advertiser -led, cross -media planning tool called Project 
Origin. The initiative aims to incorporate TV, BVoD and  online video advertising into a single 
measurement tool to help advertisers better plan and evaluate campaigns across the different 
platforms . The initiative is supported by many of the UK’s largest advertisers, as well as leading 
internet platforms includi ng Google, Facebook, Amazon and TikTok.

Programming output and spend  
PSB channels 
Investment in first -run UK-originated content by the PSBs increased in 2021, as the pressures of 
the pandemic on the production sector eased  
Spend on first-run originations by PSBs has been in steady decline over the last two decades, 
although spend levels had been relatively stable  in the few years before the pandemic. In 2020, 
however, PSB spend on first -run originations dropped sharply, due mainly  to difficulties in creating 
new content during the pandemic.  
Reduced or shorter periods of Covid-19-related restrictions in 2021 , and the easing of pressures on 
the production sector , resulted in a rebound in first-run UK originated content spend for PSBs, 
increasing by 25.9% to £2.6bn , its highest level since 2016. This was helped by the Government’s 
Film and TV Restart Scheme – a £500m fund introduced in July 2020 which made direct 
compensation available to producers who incurred costs when productions were abandoned or 
delayed as a result of Covid -19.105 However, there were some genres in which spend did not return 
to pre-pandemic levels, such as drama, where  some titles continued to be subject to production lags 
due to Covid -19, and specialist factual, which continued to be susceptible to restrictions in travel. 
All five main PSB channels increased their first -run origination spend  in 2021 compared to 2020, with 
BBC One seeing the biggest recovery – its spend increased to  £914m , up 33% compared to 2020 and 
19.6% compared to 2019. Among the main commercial PSB channels, Channel 4 ’s spend increased 
the most in percentage terms in 2021,  rising by  29.7% to £427m, followed by ITV (up 23.9% to 
£784m). Despite this increase, 2021 spend for each of the two channels was still slightly lower than

Funding from other sources has flattened out compared to growth over previous years  
In addition to the £2.6bn spent directly by PSBs on the production of original content, some PSB s 
continue to make use of funding from third-party sources, such as co -productions, tax incentives and 
distribution secondary rights revenue.  While this type of funding was trending upwards  before  2020, 
it has since levelled out, with the total amount in 2021 being broadly unchanged from 2020, at 
£483m , and £66m lower than in 2019. Last year was also the first year in which third -party spend as 
a proportion of total investment in PSB first -run network originations declined – from 19% in 2020 to 
16% in 2021.  While an element of this is the result of the  reverberating effects of Covid 19’s impact 
on productions, it may also indicate  the finite nature of outside financing opportunities – with SVoD 
providers, for example, focusing more on their own original productions than co -productions – and 
reflect changes in wider economic conditions. £810m£730m£815m £764m £687m£914m£303m£292m£285m£283m

Hours of first -run UK originations increased in 2021 in line with higher  investment following the 
peak -pandemic production challenges 
As with spend, t he pandemic interrupted what was a broadly stable trend in PSBs’ first -run 
originated output. Although  there were still some lasting effects on the delivery of some productions 
in 2021, the overall output of new original programmes on PSB channels  was similar to  the pre-
pandemic level. Hours of first -run UK-originated content from linear PSB channels stood at 35,769 in 
2021, up 5.4% on 2020, driven by an increase in originated hours on the main five PSB channels . £2,599m£2,459m£2,586m £2,522m

PSBs first -run originated programming continues to span a wide range of genres  
The range of first -run originated content provided by PSBs has remained consistently broad in recent 
years, with no major changes seen in genre breakdown in 2021. The main changes in genre provision 
in 2021 reflected the return of major sporting events , including  the UEFA  Euro  2020 football 
tournament and the Tokyo Olympic Games . There were also subtle movements within factual 
programming, with a slight shift towards general factual and factual entertainment programming rather than specialist factual content. However, this is partly  due to  the lingering effects of the 
pandemic, as noted above. There was also a small uptick in the hours of education provided on PSB 
channels in 2021, from 57 hours in 2020 to 114 hours in 2021, which can largely be explained by the 
first-run programming broadcast on CBBC and BBC Two to support home learning while schools 
were closed during the early 2021 lockdown.  20,110 19,611 19,663 19,15417,97519,76013,11612,373 12,73612,585

PSB video -on-demand 
PSB BVoD services have increased the number of hours of programming available on their 
platforms  
The ability to watch content on  demand is seen as important to audiences, and satisfaction with PSB 
BVoD services is high. This section provides analysis of the PSBs’ BVoD catalogues, including 
comparisons with  rival VoD services.  
In recent years, PSBs have been making more of their back  catalogues available to audiences, as well 
as releasing entire series of new programmes on BVoD, and the total number of hours of content 
available on the PSB BVoD services exceeded 40,000 in April 2022. This was roughly equivalent to 
the total number of hours available on Netflix ( also around 40,000) , which , unlike the PSBs,  serves a 
global subscriber base.

A higher proportion of PSB B VoD  content is made in the UK  
Although SVoD services such as Netflix have considerably more hours of content available overall 
than individual PSB B VoD services, only a small proportion  (8%) of these hours are programmes 
made in the UK. UK -made programming makes up 77 % of hours on BBC iPlayer, 73% on both ITV 
Hub and My5 , and 65% on All 4. BritBox, which is due to be folded into ITVX when the new service 
launches in late 2022, has the highest proportion of UK-made content (8 3%).

510 million streams on Netflix were to programmes first broadcast by PSBs, 133 million fewer than in Q1 2021 (643 million). Over the same period, an average UK Netflix account streamed 11 minutes 
of PSB-origina ted programming per day, with programming from the BBC accounting for four 
minutes, ITV two minutes, Channel 4 three minutes and Channel 5 two minutes. This compares to 45 
minutes per day for content first available on Netflix.

 The wider UK media market’s contribution to public service 
objectives 
Some providers of TV and video services in the wider media landscape choose to produce content 
that aligns with the statutory public service objectives.107 For instance, multichannel broadcasters, 
SVoD providers and social video platforms  invest in content that may also fulfil some of these 
objectives, across a wide range of genres. However, these groups can have very different approaches to content creation, formats, monetisation and distribution, and often work to different 
strategic aims. As a result, it can be difficult to consistently measure them, or directly compare them with PSBs, al though each can  contribute programming that is i nformative, culturally relevant, wide -
ranging and appealing to different audiences . 
The multichannel sector contributes content across a broad spectrum, from 
premium entertainment and sport s to arts and religious programming  
‘Multichannel ’ refers to broadcast TV channels that are not PSB s or their associated commercial 
portfolio channels, and includes pay -TV channels like Sky Atlantic and free- to-air channels like 
UKTV’s Dave . They are typica lly thematic, i.e . genre-specific; some  multi channels target  specific 
religious and ethnic groups, for example, while Sky operates a dedicated arts channel, Sky Arts.  
There were 29 religious channels, 27 news, 18 factual and 13 children’s channels available in the UK 
in 2021, all featuring content that aligns with PSB objectives. General entertainment channels like 
Sky Showcase and Dave show a mix of content that can include, for instance, comedy and specialist 
factual programming. While multichannels do pr ovide original content,  many contain a higher 
proportion of repeats and content bought from other providers, and/or US and other overseas content.  
Many multichannels have a strong entertainment and sport s focus – which is currently where 
channel groups concentrate the vast majority of their content spend. There are many premium entertainment channels (58 in 2021) as well as dedicated channels for sport s (42) and films (29). The 
majority of these are exclusively available on a paid-for basis and therefore not available to all audiences – especially the sports channels featuring competitions such as Premier League football or 
Formula 1 racing, 41 of which are on pay platforms only. The multichannel sector also contributes a 
significant amount to drama spend in the UK, with Sky in particular increasing its output in 2021.
108 
 
107 Under sections 264A (4) and 264(6) of the Communications Act 2003, the p ublic s ervice objectives are that broadcasting 
should: b) reflect and support cultural activity in the UK, such as drama, comedy and music; c) facilitate civic understandin g 
and fair and well -informed debate on news and current affairs; d) satisfy a wide range of different sporting and other 
leisure interests; e) include a suitable quantity and range of educational programmes and programmes dealing with 
science, religion and  other beliefs, social issues, matters of international significance or interest and matters of specialist 
interest; f) include a suitable quantity and range of high -quality and original programmes for children and young people; 
and g) reflect the lives and concerns of different communities and cultural interests and traditions within the United 
Kingdom, and locally in different parts of the United Kingdom; and include programmes made outside the M25.

 Figure 61: Number of commercial multichannels: 2021  
 
Source: Ofcom. Based on the number of channels broadcasting in the UK during 2021 , including pop -up 
channels and channels that ceased broadcasting before the end of the year , which in turn is based on 
broadcast hours submitted by Ofcom -licensed broadcasters. Free-to- air channels are defined as channels 
available on Freeview and Freesat. ‘Other’ includes adult, arts, games, and shopping channels, as well as 
‘general’ channels with no distinct genre. Channel counts exclude +1 and HD channel variants, and do not include BBC portfolio channels. 
Sports , entertainment and films drew most (94%) of multichannel spend in 2021, at £4.5bn 
combined, as illustrated in Figure 34 in the previous chapter. These key genres also receive a high 
proportion of viewing. Sports is the largest ca tegory, drawing 17.6% of multichannel viewing among 
all individuals and an even higher proportion among younger audiences (25.6% for 16 -24-year-olds). 
Films also rank highly, accounting for 9.4% of all individuals’ viewing.  
Multichannel spend on genres such as news, which drew £134m spend, and factual, which drew 
£112m, is relatively small in  the context of overall multichannel spend . Although  these spend figures 
are dwarfed by sport s, films  and entertainment, these genres are appreciated by audiences. 
Specialist factual, which includes channels like Yesterday, Discovery Channel and Sky Documentaries, 
was the second -largest category for viewing, with a 15.3% multichannel share. Other high -
performing genres included comedy, with 5.7%  share , and this genre was particularly viewed by 16-
24-year-olds (6.9%  share ). 8

SVoD services contribute significant programming spend, mostly in scripted 
content  
Like pay- TV providers, SVoD services  often have their own content specialisms, some of which 
contribute to public service objectives . But as with pay -TV providers, this content may be behind a 
paywall and therefore not available to all audiences. Major international SVoD services typically 
specialise in scripted TV , although there has recently been diversification into genres such as sport s, 
documentaries and reality programming, with large investments in UK originations by Netflix and 
Amazon Prime Video.  
The volume of originals and exclusives by major streaming companies continues to rise quickly, 
increasing by  22% in the year to April 2022 to a total of 22,685 hours (see Figure 29 in the previous 
chapter). In terms of drama spending, SVoD services have led the market in high -profile originations 
with all-at -once releases, and this extends to UK -made series such as Sex Education, Good Omens  
and Bridgerton . SVoD services have invested significantly in UK productions – Netflix by around $1bn 
across all genres in 2021 ,109 and Amazon by a similar amount across five years.110 Yet overall, this  
spend represents a relatively small output – Netflix offered 675 hours of UK -originated programming 
in April 2022, while Amazon Prime Video offered 156. PSBs remain by far the most significant provider, by content hours, of original UK programming, with 3 6,000 hours of first -run originals in 
2021, as shown in Figure 54 above.

 There is a growing amount of content on SVoD services in genres that can be  
more commercially challenging  
SVoD services also provide content in genres that can be underprovided, such as comedy, specialist 
factual and children’s. These genres can have limited audiences on domestic and ad-supported 
services, making global services , with subscription funding, more viable places to produce and 
distribute them. In line with the growth of th e overall size of SVoD catalogues, the availability of 
these genres has increased in recent years. For example, across the top seven SVoD services, 
programming aimed at children , which focus es on animation, increased in volume from 3,900 hours 
to 13,200 between 2016 and 2022.111 Children’s content is key for several SVoD services, including 
Disney+ and Netflix, and an increasing amount of what they offer in this genre is original. New and original programmes include spin -off short series from established franchises like Toy Story,  Frozen  
and Lilo and Stitch  on Disney+, and A Series of Unfortunate Events  on Netflix, which is in its third 
season.  
Comedy also remains  a focus for SVoD , continuing in importance despite plateauing in terms of 
volume of catalogue hours ; comedy hours reached 15,100 across the top seven SVoD services in 
April 2022, with catalogue expansions led by BritBox and Disney+. S pecialist factual catalogues have 
followed a similar growth trend.

Social video services are a source of news, children’s, factual and education al 
content, among other genres  
Social video services like YouTube and TikTok provide a vast amount of content hours, often in the form of short clips which range in quality and type. Many professional content makers bring their productions to the services. Although user -generated and content -creator video is at the core of 
social video’s offering, there is evidence that these services are being used as a source for news,

 particularly among young people. According to Ofcom’s latest report on news consumption in the 
UK, TikTok and YouTube and were the second and third most-used sources for any kind for news by 
12-15 year-olds , with 28% of this age group using TikTok and a further 28% using YouTube . A smaller 
but fast -growing proportion of adults were using  TikTok for news consumption  – 7% in 2022, 
compared to 1% in 2020.112 
Other genres that have succeeded  on social video services include children’s content; there is  a 
whole subsection of YouTube for children with its own website version and app. YouTube, including 
YouTube Kids, is popular among 3 -12-year-olds, of whom 59% use it, putting it in second place 
overall for places to watch content (Netflix was first, with 62%) .113 Factual  how -to videos have also 
become very popular among adults, watched at least monthly by 64% of adults who  watch short 
videos online , making these the most commonly watched type of video.114 When asked open 
question s for Ofcom’s 2021 PSM Tracker about their viewing, some respondents  pointed particularly 
to the specificity and uniqueness of some of the content available on YouTube, including how -to 
videos. 
People said:  
“Mainly use YouT ube – niche interests are available on YouTube that I would never expect BBC to 
pick up. I can watch really specific video tutorials for art / vlogs for cycling / tips for techniques etc 
which are not available on terrestrial [TV] and don't need to be.” Woman, 25 -34 
“…YouTube in particular provides information you can't find on other [TV -]type sources.”          
Man, 35 -44 
“…YouTube is used to find out something like how to open a specific watch in order to change the 
battery , etc.” Man, 75+  
Educational c ontent has been a focus for some social video services. Early in the pandemic, TikTok 
pledged to invest $50m in educational content globally, including US partnerships with “ 800 public 
figures, media publishers, educational institutions, and real-world pro fessional experts ” to create 
more professional learning content.115 The hashtag #learnontiktok has become very popular, with 
327 billion global views – in comparison,  #music and #workout have 244 billion and 86 billion views 
respectively, although #comedy h as more, with 1,635 billion. While this figure is significant, some of 
the content using the hashtag does not necessarily reflect learning or education  – videos uploaded 
with the hashtag cover everything from typical specialist factual topics (e.g . biology , history) to 
lifestyle (e.g. money tips, cooking, makeup) to less relevant miscellaneous meme content (e.g. prank 
and reaction  videos), which use the hashtag to boost views.

 SVoD and social video services carry content from PSBs in different windows 
or different formats 
Some SVoD services’ acquired content – which complements their original programmes – includes 
licens ed back -catalogue programming originally shown on PSB channels. Netflix had 1,100 hours of 
programming from the BBC, ITV and Channel 4116 in April 2022, while Amazon Prime Video had 
1,300. As detailed in the first chapter of this report,  SVoD services have significant reach – 
particularly Netflix and Amazon Prime Video  – and users typically find them easy to use ,117 meaning 
that global SV oD services may  have a role in introducing people  to programmes  they might  
otherwise not discover.  
However, there has been a decrease  in SVoD catalogues  in the volume of programming originally 
shown on a PSB channel. This trend was led by a notable drop in BBC content on both Netflix and 
Amazon Prime V ideo. The SV oD service with the largest volume  of PSB archive content is  ITV-run 
BritBox ; its library has been growing for the past two years, and in April 2022 reached nearly 5,000 
hours of programmes previously shown on BBC, ITV and Channel 4. The composition of this library 
may change in the future, as ITV’s new ITVX service absorbs BritBox.

As with SVoD, people also see PSB brands on social video services. According to Ofcom’s PSM Tracker, three in ten (31%) of those who had  used YouTube in the past six  months sa id they had 
watched a PSB YouTube channel. BBC YouTube channels were  the most likely (24%), followed by any 
ITV YouTube channel and any Channel 4  YouTube channel  (14% each) . Younger YouTube viewers are 
more likely than older ones  to use these channels; for example, almost half (47%) of 16-34-year-olds 
 
116 Channel 5 hours are not broken out separately from total Paramount hours and have therefore been excluded from this 
analysis.  
117 According to Ofcom’s  PSM Tracker  survey, high proportions of people who had used SVoD in the last six months agreed 
that the services were easy to find their way around  – 82% that had used Netflix  said so , followed by  78% for Disney+ and 
72% for Amazon Prime Video . 912

 Radio and audio  
Introduction: 100 years of radio stations broadcasting in the UK  
A century of innovation  
The first experimental radio broadcasts took place in the UK in 1920, but it was not until 1922 that 
the Marconi Company made the first recognisable radio stations with regular broadcasts and  
programme content. Its 2MT radio station started broadcasting fr om outside Chelmsford in February 
1922, followed by London station 2LO a few months later.  
The last century has seen an expansion in the number and types of radio service accessible to UK 
listeners. The UK radio sector has also innovated in its use of new technologies and platforms to reach audiences. Improvements in sound quality and choice of services came with the introduction 
of FM broadcasting in the 1950s, then with the introduction of DAB and online streaming from the 
mid-1990s and the roll -out of some radio services on digital TV platforms from the late  1990s.  
As we discuss in more detail below, innovation and evolution will continue this year  with the launch 
of the first small-scale DAB multiplexes and the ongoing swich -off of analogue AM medium wa ve 
(MW) services, which use the same fundamental broadcasting technology as 2MT back in 1922.

Work continues to support the radio sector in delivering for its listeners over the coming decades  
Data in this and previous Media Nations  reports  show that the ways in which people access and 
listen to  radio and audio content continue to evolve. Listening on digital platforms has grown over 
time, but the proportion of audio listening time accounted for by live radio has fallen. This reflects in 
part the growth of music s treaming services, which more than doubled their share of time spent 
listening to audio from 8% in 2017 to 20% by 2022.118

 In the light of  these and other changes in audience behaviour , and related industry developments, 
DCMS commissioned the Digital Radio and Audio Review , which included input from radio 
broadcasters and their trade bodies , as well as device and car manufacturers.  The Review published 
its findings in October 2021 and set out a total of 42 recommendations. One recommendation was 
that FM radio would be needed in the UK until at least 2030 ; although  online listening continues to 
grow, FM remains an important part of radio listening. While suggesting that no formal date for AM 
switch -off should be mandated, the Review recommended that industry should plan for migration 
away from the platform for national services from around the middle of this decade. The review also 
made recommendations concerning access to radio content on connected devices, funding of 
content, the availability of digital radio in vehicles , and net zero . 
The Government published its response to the review in April 2022. In particular, it said:  
• The Government and industry will carry out a review in 2026 to look at a potential timescale for the switch -off of analogue radio in the UK  
• It would seek to update the regulation of commercial radio when legislative time is available  
• It agreed that the argument had been made for new regulation to protect radio’s long-term 
position in the context of smart speakers and other connected devices, but that given the 
complexity of the issue, further work and research would be necessary in this area  
• It has asked Ofcom to undertake a review of DAB+ to help determine whether it would be 
appropriate to allow a faster migration from the DAB to DAB+ broadcasting standard. 
(Ofcom has started to undertake this work.)  
The remainder of this chapter discusses recent industry developments and audience trends, sets out key statistics and commentary on the sector , and provides context to the recommendations above. 
Industry revenues   
Radio revenues re turned to growth in  2021, as the advertising market started 
to recover  
Radio revenues grew by 20% in 2021 to £638m . This was driven by growth in national advertising 
revenues, which increased by 22% to £346m.119 In contrast, other relevant turnover (which includes 
items such as premium-rate SMS revenues from competitions) grew by 8% year on year.  
Although  advertising, sponsorship and other relevant turnover was up across the sector as a whole, 
our analysis suggests that the strength and nature of the recovery since 2020 has varied across 
stations and broadcasters, with some continuing to note difficult trading conditions into 2021 and 
beyond. This may reflect differences in underlying business models and broadcaster scale, as well as 
the characteristics of local advertising markets between the nations and regions of the UK, with 
broadcasters noting differen ces in the strength of recovery in different parts of the country.120  
 
119 Note : this national spot advertising figure includes revenues from advertising sold via agencies from bases outside 
London in centres such as Manchester and Edinburgh , in addition to London- based agency offices.  
120 For example, some broadcasters told us that local advertising, from some businesses , e.g. restaurants and hospitality , 
had continued to be affected in 2021 due to Covid -19 restrictions around business openings and gatherings.  Media Nations 2022

The pandemic  brought  changes in the types of companies wishing to advertise on radio. In 2021 , 
Government, social and political organisations’ share of radio advertising  continued to be 
significantly higher than in 2019. Online retailer s’ share of radio advertising doubled between 2019 
and 2021, accounting for 4% of expenditure in 2021  compared to 2% two years earlier. 
As in 2020, the largest single advertiser on UK commercial radio in 2021 was the Government. 
Second place in 2021 was McDonald’s Restaurant Limited, which had t he third largest expenditure in 
2020 (Camelot Group Limited was second place in 2020).121

 Total expenditure on digital audio advertising grew by 58% in  2021 to reach 
£164m 
At £110m in 2021, expenditure on audio advertising on streaming platforms and online  radio  apps 
was greater than the total expenditure on digital audio in the pr evious year, with expenditure up by  
a reported  56% year on year. Advertising expenditure on podcasts grew by even more in 
proportiona l terms, increasing by a reported 61 % to reach £54m.

Although it does not break out UK advertising revenues, Spotify reported growth of 62% in its global 
ad-supported revenues between 2020 and 2021, to €1.21bn (£1.04bn) , driven by increases in 
advertising impressions as well as an uplift in advertising price.122 
Subscriptions continued to increase their share of growing consumer 
expenditure on recorded music  
Overall consumer expenditure on recorded music grew by 10% in 2021 to reach £1.7bn. Consumer 
spend  on music subscription services grew by 13% to reach almost £1.4bn, meaning that 
subscriptions now account for 79% of total consumer expenditure on music, compared to less than 
half in 2017. Spotify’s UK revenues (including  both premium and advertising-supported accounts) 
grew by 19% year on year, reaching €994m (£854m) in 2021.  
In contrast to the trend seen in previous years, expenditure on physical formats grew between 2020 and 2021, driven by a 23% year-on -year increase in vinyl LP sales, which totalled £135m. E xpenditure 
on CDs continued to decline. The number of cassettes sold in the UK grew by 18.5% to reach 
185,000, the highest since 2003.

Advertising and subscription funding models are increasingly important 
revenue sources for the UK recorded music industry  
Music streaming services accounted for 66% of the sector’s revenues in 2021, up from 40% in 2017. 
At 88% of overall streaming revenues, revenues from subscription streaming accounted for 58% of 
total recorded industry revenues in 2021.

Radio sector trends  
The n umber of AM MW  radio services in the UK continues to decline  
There has been a further decline in the number of AM medium wave ( MW ) services available , with 
the BBC switching off MW broadcasts for ten  of its local and nations stations in May and June 2021, 
while reducing  MW coverage of BBC Radio Gloucestershire and BBC Radio Ulster.125 The continued 
availability of MW AM services is a distinctive feature of the UK radio market , given that in many 
European countries these services have  ceased,126 with the Czech Radio  switchi ng off AM MW and 
LW broadcasts at the end of 2021.127

 In late February 2022, three national services128 owned by Jack Media National ceased broadcasting 
on the Sound Digital national DAB multiplex, with Jack Media National Limited entering 
administration in early March. Three slots on the multiplex were advertised. Throughout the past 
year, services have co ntinued to launch on local multiplexes , with others ceasing to broadcast.

Coverage of national DAB multiplexes has remained constant in recent years. However, UK local DAB 
multiplex coverage grew between March 2021 and March 2022 following the launch of local multiplexes in England covering North and West Cumbria  and Morecambe B ay, meaning that 92% of 
UK homes have local DAB coverage, an increase of one percentage point. A local multiplex for the Channel Islands also launched. As noted above, the launch of these multiplexes has finally enabled all BBC local stations to be availab le on DAB. In addition to simulcasting the existing local analogue 
stations, the multiplex in the Channel Islands has enabled additional local stations to launch, as well as UK national commercial services such as Capital, talkSPORT and Virgin Radio , accessible on the 
islands  for the first time  on DAB .

The first small- scale DAB multiplexes have now launched, with others 
expected to follow later in 2022 
The first non -trial small -scale DAB multiplex launched on 10 December 2021 , covering a population 
of around 400,000 people in North -East England ( Tynemouth and South Shields ) and carrying  14 
DAB+ services, which had increased to 18 by August 20 22. Three of these are Community -Digital 
Sound Programme ( C-DSP) services that, like analogue community radio services, are required to be 
run for social gain and on a not-for-profit basis. By August 2022, a further half -dozen small -scale 
multiplexes had launched in locations  around Engl and and Scotland, and successful applicants 
around the UK continue to prepare to launch services. Ofcom has continued to advertise and license 
small -scale DAB multiplexes , and opened the fourth round of licensing in July 2022 , with a deadline 
for applications in October. In the July announcement we also set out the areas in London and 
South -East England that we expect to advertise in the fifth round of licensing, scheduled for 2023.  
DAB+ radios account for an increasing proportion of DAB radios sold  
The first DAB+ services in the UK launched on the Sound Digital national multiplex in 2016. Since 
then, the number of services using this more efficient standard has increased , and includes services 
on the Digital One multiplex and some local multiplexes. All services on small-scale multiplexes are 
broadcast using the DAB+ standard. DAB+ is backwards -compatible with DAB, meaning that all 
DAB+ -capable devices can receive standard DAB broadcasts, but DAB radios without DAB+ 
functionality are unable to receive services broadcast using DAB+. By 2021, 69% of DAB radios sold in the UK were compatible with DAB+, up from 49% in 2017, although overall DAB+ device sales 
declined in absolute terms during this period. Due to the number of analogue- only radios continuing 
to be sold, sales of DAB+ -compatible sets accounted for only 38% of total radio sales in 2021.  Media Nations 2022 
90 
 In the Government’s  Digital Radio and Audio Review , it was recommended that Ofcom should 
undertake a market study to assess the current status of DAB+ device penetration and use by 
listeners.129 Ofcom has recently commissioned a quantitative survey which will be used to estimate 
the extent of DAB+ device ownership and use, both in-home and in -car. The findings of this research 
will be published alongside our call for inputs on the issues relating to the future use of D AB+.

M&A activity continues to extend the reach of broadcasters into new 
geographies and markets  
Although  the past year has not seen the large -scale mergers -and-acquisitions activity of certain 
previous years, Global and Bauer have both acquired licences or businesses which they have used to 
extend the reach of their services on analogue. In August 2021 Global acquired Quidem Media, the 
owner of six stations in th e Midlands that since 2019 had been Capital franchisees. In the same 
month, Bauer completed its acquisition of Imagine FM licences, allowing it to expand the FM 
coverage of its Greatest Hits network into parts of Greater Manchester, Cheshire and the Peak 
District. Outside the UK, in May  2022, Bauer acquire d the radio assets of Portuguese media group 
Media Capital Group, following its expansion into the Irish market in 2021.130  
In March 2022, Nation Broadcasting acquired a 10% stake in Podcast Radio as part of a funding 
round that will be used to support Podcast Radio’s expansion into the North American and 
Australian markets.131 Nation Broadcasting announced in July 2022 that, fo llowing the end of its 
licensing agreement with Bauer, it would rebrand stations using Bauer’s The Hits and Greatest Hits 
brand with Nation Radio and Easy Radio.132

The BBC will increasingly focus on digital radio and audio platforms  
In May 2022 Tim Davie, the Director -General of the BBC, set out the BBC’s digital-f irst strategy ,133 
designed to shift the BBC’s focus (and expend iture) more towards digital platforms, which account 
for an increasing proportion of consumption of the BBC’s content . As a result, the BBC is proposing 
to reduce spend on live linear broadcasts. Concerning radio in particular, the BBC is proposing to: 
stop broadcasting BBC Radio 4 Extra ; end specific programming for BBC Radio 4 on AM long  wave 
ahead of the closure of long wave broadcasting ;134 and to cease broadcasting BBC Radio 5 Live on 
AM MW no later than December 2027, as part of the withdraw of nati onal AM medium wave 
services. As we note in our discussion a bout the number and availability of radio services in the UK, 
the BBC has been reducing the number and coverage of its AM medium wave services for some 
years, and these announcements  continue this  trend.  
Audience trends 
This section provides data and commentary on some of the latest audience trends across radio, online, and in -car audio habits. Analysis of consumer trends relating to music streaming, podcasts 
and smart speakers can be found later in this chapter. 
Radio in context  
Live radio listening on a radio set was the audio activity with the greatest reach each week in Q1 
2022, although the competition from streamed music intensified  
Listening to live radio on a radio set continues to be the mo st popular audio activity, with almost 
two-thirds  of adults doing this each week. While radio maintained a high reach, the proportion of 
adults listening to the radio this way has continued to decline each year as more listeners turn to 
online audio activities, especially online streamed music. Listening to online radio and podcasts has 
seen a slow but steady increase in the p ast five years, but overall reach remain s relatively low 
compared to that of streamed music. Streamed music services were used by nea rly half of all adults 
at the beginning of 2022, and over three -quarters of those aged 15 -34. We take a closer look at 
these changes in music streaming in the section below.

Listening to live radio on a radio set continue s to account for the largest  share of time spent 
listening, at  over half (55%) of all listening time.  However, this is down from 71% five years ago. Over 
the same period, streamed music’s share has increased from 8% in 2017 to 20% at the start of 2022. 
Online radio has doubled its share of time spent listening in the last five years, from 4% in 2017 to 8% in 2022.  79%

 How young adults aged 15 -34 spend their time listening is quite different to the behaviour of the 
overall population. Listening to online music via a streaming service account ed for 47% of their total 
listening time in Q1 2022 – more than double the 22% in 2017. For t his age group, live radio on a 
radio set’s share of listening was  around a quarter of  total time, a considerable decline from 44% in 
2017.

About  nine in ten adults listened to live radio each week in Q1 2022, with commercial radio 
attracting more listeners than BBC radio  
RAJAR, the body that measures radio listening for the industry, suspended its research in March 
2020 as a consequence of the Cov id-19 pandemic , so RAJAR data could not  be included in last year’s 
Media Nations report. However, fieldwork resumed last year, resulting in quarterly data from Q3 2021. These figures show that overall reach of  BBC and commercial stations held steady over t his 
period. The  latest figures , from Q1 2022 , show that  89% of adults listened to live radio for at least 
five minutes each week, and on average, listener s tune d in for about  20 hours across the week. BBC 
radio account ed for just under half of all live radio listening hours, driven by listening to its ten  
national services (but especially BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 4) , and its share of list ening has 
increased slightly since Q3 2021 . Two -thirds of UK adults tune d into c ommercial radio stations each 
week, slightly more than those who listened to BBC radio stations.  44%71%24%55%

There are some differences in radio listening across the different parts of the UK. Figure 80 shows  
the top three stations based on market share in each of the BBC local areas.135 Across t he UK as a 
whole, BBC Radio 2 was the most -listened-to station , followed by BBC Radio 4 , then Global’s Heart 
network of stations. In fact, BBC Radio 2 wa s the number one station in most markets , apart from  
seven of the areas shown , where it holds the number two slot , and in Northern Ireland where it is 
fourth behind BBC Radio Ulster and Bauer local stations. 
BBC nations/local stations featured in the top three positions in eight of the markets shown, holding 
the number -one spot in Northern Ireland and in Cornwall. Bauer’s Greatest Hits Network, including 
some stations which have retained their heritage names , such as Metro Radio in the BBC Radio 
Newcastle area, feature d in the top three in many areas across the north of England as well as in 
Scotland an d Northern Ireland. Global’s Heart Network appeared  in the top three stations for most 
areas but particularly in the south of the UK , with Smooth Network performing better in the north. 
Tindle Radio, one of the smaller UK commercial groups, dominated liste ning in the Channel Islands  – 
Tindle’s stations were the only commercial stations to broadcast in the Channel Islands until the 
recent arrival of the DAB multiplex.  
  
 
135 We have used BBC nations/local radio total survey areas (TSAs) for this analysis as they are non -overlapping areas. A

Online radio  
Industry trends  
As we have noted in previous reports, broadcasters, including the BBC, the commercial and the 
community radio sector s, have developed their online radio services, both on and off their platforms 
and websites , offering both live streaming and catch -up services. Distribution via large third- party 
platforms potentially offers broadcasters global reach but may reduce their ability to control the 
user experience and to capture and analyse data on use and audiences. RadioPlayer, first launched 
by the BBC and UK commercial radio sector as a broadcaster -owned-and- controlled platform for 
radio stations, has continued to expand, with services now available in 14 countries.  
Cross-industry partnerships such as this may become increasingly important to broadcasters , as car 
manufacturers increasingly adopt hybrid or online -only radios in new cars. Given their scale, car 
manufa cturers may be unwilling to deal directly with individual broadcasters seeking to ensure that 
their services are available in cars, while an industry -wide approach allows for standardisation of 
metadata and guidelines around the listener experience.  
Broadc asters – especially those creating speech content such as LBC and talkRADIO/TalkTV  – 
continue to use their YouTube channels and social media accounts to distribute catch -up clips of Media Nations 2022 
97 
 their shows. This  broadens the reach of their content (helping to raise aw areness of their broadcast 
stations) while also providing an additional advertising revenue stream.  GB News and TalkTV 
simulcast their TV output as an audio -only stream online and on DAB. The BBC, which also makes 
video clips of some of its radio output av ailable on YouTube, and some full shows on BBC iPlayer, 
announced in July 2022  that it plans to broadcast the BBC Radio 5 Live Nicky Campbell weekday 
programme on BBC Two as well as on a new BBC news channel.136 
Audience trends  
Radio listening on smart speakers accounted for 10% of all hours in Q1 2022  
While reach and time spent listening to radio have both decreased steadily over the past few years, 
how people listen to radio has also changed considerably. Time spent listening to radio online 
accounted for over a fifth of listening during January to March  2022, with smart speakers 
contributing to almost half of this  (the first time RAJAR has measured radio listening on smart 
speakers ). Among those who own them,  smart speaker use accounted for 20% of  their time spent 
listening to the radio. We go into more detail about how listeners use their smart speaker for radio, as well as other activities , in the dedicated section below . 
As noted above, radio sets continue to be the main way to listen to the radio, w ith over 70% of 
listening hours accounted for by a DAB or analogue radio set. The o verall share of listening that is 
digital (online, DAB, digital TV) has increased over the last two  quarter s (67.9%, up from 64.5% in Q4 
2021 and 65.8% in Q3 2021), as a result of the  increase in the proportion of online listening hours.

 In-car audio habits  
Listening to live radio on an AM/FM radio was the most common in -car audio activity in 2022  
RAJAR data indicate s that a bout a fifth of listening each week took place in cars in Q1 2022. Ofcom’s  
Technology Tracker show ed that listening to live radio on an AM/FM radio was the most common 
audio activ ity in cars in 2022, with 54% of drivers/passengers saying they listen ed this way, closely 
followed by 47% who listen ed via an in -car DAB radio.  
Passengers and drivers of cars also listen to audio content via a range of online means. A bout  a fifth 
listened to music using a streaming service on a mobile phone and a further 9% listened to a 
streaming service via an in -car infotainment system. Both activities are more likely for younger 
listeners – 38% of 16-24-year-olds  listened to a streaming service via a m obile phone, and 19% 
listened via the in- car infotainment system. In terms of time spent listening to the radio in a car, 
RAJAR indicates that this was relatively evenly split between analogue (46%) and DAB (47%) , and 
that online listening accounted for 7%  in Q1 2022.

Music streaming  
Industry overview  
Firms active in the music streaming space are seeking to diversify their revenues  
As noted above, music streaming retail and wholesale revenues have continued to grow in recent 
years. However, there is some evidence to suggest that growth in subscriptions may slow or even decline in 2022 as households seek to reduce expenditure.

 While the core streaming business has grown, platforms have been seeking ways to differentiate 
themselves and offer new services to their users. In October 2021, Apple launched its Apple Music 
Voice plan, offering a discount on a standard Apple Music subscription,138 with the proviso that the 
music can only be accessed via Siri (for example , on a HomePod smart speaker) rather than via a 
range of interfaces and devices.  
Firms in the online music sector have rolled out other services rela ted to music streaming, while 
platforms in other media sectors are also looking at music distribution platforms to supplement their existing offerings. For example, in March 2022, Bytedance, the parent company  of TikTok, launched 
a music marketing and distribution platform called SoundOn, which manages the uploading of music 
content to TikTok and ByteDance’s Resso music streaming platform, in addition to Spotify, Apple 
Music, Pandora and other platforms.
139 The same month, Epic Games, publisher of Fortnite , acquired 
the independent music -focused download platform Bandcamp.140 Having previously hosted live 
virtual concerts in Fortnite, this acquisition may suggest that virtual events and music will play more 
of a role on the Fortnite  platform.  
The streaming sector has come under increased scrutiny  
As the scale and scope of the content hosted on music streaming services has increased, some platforms, notably Spotify, have been subject to criticism for their approaches to content 
moderation. In early 2022, seve ral music artists including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell requested 
that their music be pulled from the platform in protest at Spotify continuing its exclusivity deal with  
The Joe Rogan Experience  podcast, following concerns about Covid -19 misinformation on  the 
podcast.
141 Spotify published its Platform Rules,142 establishing policies around music and podcasts 
hosted on its platform , in January 2022, and in June announced the creation of the Spotify Safety 
Advisory Board to advise in areas related to audience protection and content moderation.  
The past year has also seen business models in the music sector , including streaming, come under 
particular scrutiny following the DCMS Select Committee’s report into the Economics of Music 
Streaming  i n July 2021. The report highlighted concerns about the competitive posi tion of some 
players in the market , with copyright advantages due to their roots as user-generated platforms, in 
addition to the relative bargaining position of authors and artists as opposed to publishers and distribution platforms. 
In response, in Januar y 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) formally launched a 
Market Study  into music and streaming services , with a particular focus on the recorded music 
element of the value chain. In July 2022 the CMA published an update : its initial analysis indicates 
that the market is delivering good outcomes for consumers. However, the CMA  also said it  would be 
concerned if the market changed in ways that might  harm consumer interests. Its final report will be 
published in January 2023.

 Audience trends  
The weekly reach of music streaming services seems to be plateauing, although there is still room 
for growth, particularly among  older listeners 
The w eekly reach of streamed music to  all adults has nearly doubled in the past five years, but since 
2020 has remained relatively stable across all age groups. Younger people still stream music the 
most, with nearly eight in ten 15 -34-year-olds streaming music on a weekly basis in 2022. This was 
also the only age group to see an increase in reach in 2022, while those aged 35+ either streame d as 
much or less than in summer 2021.  This slight drop in average reach could be due to changes in 
working patterns and behaviour, as Covid -19-related lockdowns eased at the start of 2022 and more 
people resumed commuting and in -car radio listening.  
Figure 83: Weekly reach of streamed music, by age group : 2017-2022

Spotify accounted  for the majority of time spent streaming  music in Q1 2022, with Amazon and 
Apple Musi c a distant second and third  
In terms of the platforms people are using, most  of the time spent streaming music in the period 
January to March 2022 was on Spotify. Together , the free and paid -for (Premium) subscription tiers 
accounted for more than two-thirds of adults’ time spent streaming music , and this was even higher 
for those aged 15 -34, at 81%. Young adults  were also more likely to use Spotify Premium, but less 
likely to use other paid-f or services , including Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music, and Amazon Music 
Unlimited. This may  be linked to a number of factors, including the popularity of Spotify’s Premium 
Student , a discounted subscription tier for people in higher education, introduced in 2014.  26%49%

Podcasts  
Industry overview  
Companies in the sector are using M&A to acquire new podcast content or tools for monetisation  
Platforms and broadcasters continue to use acquisitions to increase their access to podcast content 
or technology , to aid the monetisation of this and other spoken -word content. For example, in 
December 2021, Global acquired Sheffield-based Captivate, a podcast hosting and monetisation platform,
143 two months after acquiring US -based Remixd, whose platform automates the creation 
of natural -voice audio output from written content.  
Spotify has also made acquisitions to develop its portfolio of spoken-word digital audio content and services, acquiring audiobook platform Findaway in November 2021 and both Chartable (an advert 
measurement and attribution tool) and Podsights (a tool for p odcast analytics)  in February 2022. It 
also acquired Heardle, a game in which players name song s being played based on short excerpts, in 
July 2022. Spotify believes the game can also be a music discovery tool, as at the end of the game, 
the player is give n the option to listen to the full song on Spotify.
144  
In May 2022, Sirius XM announced that it had acquired US comedian Conan O’Bri en’s production 
company Team Coco , which produces  a range of podcasts and other content formats. As part of the 
deal, O’Brien will stay with the company for five years.145 The acquisition gives Sirius XM ownership 
of the podcasts and expands its production capability while also allowing it to sell advertising across 
Team Coco’s content.

 However, the past year has seen at least one example of a shift away from podcasts and other forms 
of spoken -word content, with Facebook closing some of its audio services and its Audio Hub, 
removing services launched in the previous year.146 From May 2022, publishers were no longer able 
to add podcasts to Facebook, and its short -form audio product Soundbites has also been shuttered. 
The functionality of Facebook Live Audio Rooms is being rolled into the Facebook Live product rather than continuing as a separate product.  
Publishers (including broadcasters) and platforms have continued to see value in attracting established podcasts and talent to their services. Examples of this in 2022 include Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel, presenters of the BBC’s Americast podcast, moving to Global, where they will launch a 
new podcast scheduled for September 2022.
147 Following the end of their BBC show and podcast in 
April 2022, Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo launched a new film and TV review podcast with Sony 
Music the following month.  
Audience trends  
About  one in five adults listen to a podcast at least once a week  
RAJAR indicates that just under a fifth of adults listened to podcasts at least once a week (18%) in Q1 2022. This varies by demographic, with podcast listeners more likely to be men, aged under 45  and 
in the ABC1 socio -economic group. While people  from a minority ethnic background were less likely 
than the white population to listen to the radio each week (75% vs 92%), they were slightly more 
likely to listen to podcasts. This is likely to be drive n by the sheer range of content available through 
podcasts, covering many different interests.

According to data from Ofcom’s latest Podcast Survey, t he most popular reasons for listening to 
podcasts were entertainment, to learn something new or improve knowledge of something, and to 
relax. In comparison, the most popular reasons for listening to music radio were background 
listening, entertainment and discovering new music, while speech radio was mainly for catching up 
on news. The same proportion of people reported listening to podcasts and radio for company  and 
out of habit, perhaps indicating that listeners are building podcasts into their r outines in a similar 
way to traditional radio listening.

 Podcast listeners said they had a wide choice of content and that listening helped to inform them  
Almost nine in ten people who listened to podcasts regularly in 2022 said that they liked the 
convenience of being able to listen to podcasts when it suited them. Listeners were also likely to 
agree that podcasts offered a wide range of content, including content not  available on radio. Three-
quarters of people who listened to podcasts regularly in 2022 said they felt more informed as a 
result, although only 48% of regular listeners said that they trusted what they heard in podcasts. The 
majority of listeners (56%) ag reed that there should be clear warnings about possible offensive 
language or topics at the start of podcasts, but a similar proportion (55%) were not worried about content being potentially offensive or upsetting, either to themselves or others.

Digging deeper into how these attitudes vary across demographics, we see that women, people 
from minority ethnic backgrounds and those with children in the household were more likely than 
the overall average to agree that there should be clear warnings about possible offensive language 
or topics at the start of podcasts (64%, 72% and 67% compared to the average of 56%) . Those from 
minority ethnic backgrounds were also more likely to worry about content in podcasts being potentially upsetting to themselves or others (39% v s 20% among all respondents ). They were also 
more likely to listen to podcasts only  from people they  had heard of , and to trust what they hear in 
podcasts , compared to both the white population and the overall average.  9%23%31%32%32%40%40%41%57%6%10%11%18%20%11%14%

 Smart  speakers  
Industry developments 
Voice assistants are being launched as new platforms and are being integrated into other  apps  
The relationship between devices such as smart speakers and voice assistants is complex, reflecting 
the range of devices through which a voice assistant may be ac cessed, and the range of purposes  for 
which the voice assistant is designed. Some platforms such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and 
Apple Homeplay work ac ross a range of devices developed by the platforms themselves , as well as 
third parties , and are designed with a wide range of purposes  in mind , including controlling devices, 
content discovery and acting as a general voice interface for online services . In contrast, other voice 
assistant platforms are designed for more specialist use s; for example, controlling the functionality 
of particular devices, or for use in cars.  
In June 2022, Sonos, whose smart speakers support a range of other platforms, launched its own 
voice assistant platform , Sonos Voice Control.148 In contrast to Alexa and Google Assistant, Sonos’s 
platform is focused on  controlling devices and access ing music . The platform launched in the US and 
will expand to France later this  year. Alexa can be used with devices with Sonos Voice Control (for 
example, for smart home control or online searc hing), although Google Assistant cannot. In contrast 
to some other voice assistant platforms that use the cloud rather than local processing to process 
and transcribe speech, Sonos Voice Control uses devices that process the speech locally.149 
In a shift away from standalone voice apps, in 2023 Google will cease supporting Google Assistant 
Conversational Actions for its voice platform on Android devices. Instead, developers will be 
encouraged to develop voice-enabled Android apps for mobile, wearables, TV an d cars , which 
integrate with Google Assistant.150  
Take -up and consumer trends 
Take -up of smart speakers has increased since 2020  
Ofcom’s Technology Tracker  found that a bout four in ten (39%) people in the UK aged 16+ had a 
smart speaker in their household  in 2022, up from just 22% in 2020. There was little variation in 
household ownership of the device in terms of age, although the 35 -54 age group were the most 
likely to say they had one in their home. Most people who had a smart speaker in their household 
personally used it  – only 10% of those who had the device did not personally use it. Households with 
a smart speaker own an average of  1.7 devices.  
In terms of the type of device people use, 39% of those who had a smart speaker in their household had a device with a smart display.
151 However, only 4% of smart speaker owners used their device 
for watching video. Amazon Echo was by far the most common type of smart speaker owned, with

 80% saying they had one. Google Home/Google Nest was  the second  most popular,  with 15% of 
people having one, followed by Sonos at just 3%, and all other brands were at 2% or less. 
Although  using smart speakers to listen to audio from video content was a relatively less popular 
activity, listening to music via a streaming  service (61%) and live radio (59%) were more common. 
These were followed by getting weather reports (37%) and searching for information online (35%). 
Using the smart speaker as an alarm or personal reminder (32%) or  for news reports (27%) was also 
common.  
We noted above that total online radio hours increased in Q1 2022 compared to the previous quarter. While the share of listening to BBC radio stations overall was the same on smart speakers as 
on other online devices (41%), the share of all commercial radio stations was slightly higher on smart 
speakers (56% vs 54%) and  was even higher for 15-24 -year-olds .

Ofcom has recently commissioned a piece of qualitative research to further understand the impact of smart speakers on daily life and how use of the devices may affect  listening behaviour. We plan to

PLANNING FRAMEWORK  
  The City Commission  has established  the following Missio n Statement  which states : 
  
The City of North Port will provide the health, safety and welfare services to our  
residents which would not be otherwise provided or could not be provided efficiently or 
equally without the intervention of government at the local level.  
 
The City will provide said services in a professional and financially responsible manner, and 
by listening , engaging, and serving our residents. 
 The Planning Framework, developed as part of the Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR) of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan updated as part of the 2005 EAR  visioning process , and further modified 
as part of the 2016 Evaluation and Appraisal Review , contains the basic  building- blocks of the 
citizens’ vision for the City at build -out.  The Planning Framework is an instrument created for use 
by City citizens , City officials , and the public to help guide in the revision of the state mandated 
Comprehensive Plan. While not required by statute, t he Citizen Advisory Committees and staff  
developed the Planning Framework through public input to provide a synopsis which formally establishes the focus of the newly amended Comprehensive Plan.  The Goals, Objectives and Policies tha t are found in each element of the Comprehensive Plan have been designed to implement 
or better define one or more vision statements in the Planning Framework.  
Article I.  Planning Vision  
 
Planning begins with vision.  This vision focuses on what a desirable future would include.  When looking at the development and past planning for the City, the vision includes availability of jobs and business opportunities; the strength of existing and future neighborhoods; urban design; the 
provision of adequate utilities includi ng potable water, sewer and solid waste  disposal ; the condition 
of streets; the quality of the Myakkahatchee Creek; the quality of open space and City parks; the availability of affordable living homes and diversified housing  opportunities ; and the accessi bility 
and adequacy of health care, social services, employment,  libraries, schools and protective services.  
In summary, the City should be a place where citizen s can live, work, shop, learn , and recreate within 
the corporate limits of the City.  These ar e some basic elements that contribute to the quality of life  
acceptable to the citizens of North Port .  
 Concepts are a result of vision.  Concepts provide the framework and direction which will enable the City to best achieve its desired goals.  The planning concepts for the City of North Port are as follows:   
                                                                                                                          Planning Framework 
                                                                               
 1-4 1.  Projected Growth  
 The City  recognizes that its  population will increase with time.  The City will plan accordingly to 
ensure that future community needs and vision are realized , based on the projected population 
growth .  To accomplish  this, the City shall utilize the master planning approach for in frastructure 
needs.  This approach shall implement the Goals, Objective and P olicies  and shall identify the needs 
at build -out and program the needs over time, within the  financial  capability of the City.   
 
2.  Neighborhoods 
 
This concept involves ensuring that existing and future residential areas are designed and developed 
in a way that creates  viable and stable neighborhoods.  The City was originally  conceived with a 
basis on a  neighborhood concept  that would include  small commercial and park areas in each 
neighborhood.  The City recognizes that stable neighborhoods are major assets to the community.  
The original design concept remains valid. For existing neighborhoods, the neighborhood’s 
character needs should be defined so that necessary improvements are built and policies are 
developed to support the  neighborhood’ s character.  For future neighborhoods , the City ’s 
Comprehensive Plan, Unified Land Development Code, and Pattern Books  should guide 
development to create aesthetically pleasing and safe neighborhoods, and ensure the provision of the necessar y infrastructure which will enhance the neighborhoods overall character. Neighborhoods 
should be externally connected to other neighborhoods, activity center s, and town centers.  
Connectivity includes vehicular and/or pedestrian bridges, fitness trails, sidewalks, golf cart paths that would also serve as access for emergency vehicles , and mass transit facilities.   
 
3.  Activity Centers  and Town Center s 
 Several Activity C enters  and Town Center s exist within the City, each having its own potentially 
unique characteristics and functions.  The City has developed  design guidelines which will guide 
development and define the individual character of each Activity Center and for Town and Village  
Centers . The Activity C enters  and Town/ Village  Centers  should provide for a mix of land uses that 
implement the goals desired for each area.  For example, an Activity C enter’s design can provide for 
diverse housing types, affordable living , employment areas,  a variety of recreational opportunities 
and community spaces , internal and external connectivity,  etc.  Each A ctivity Center  and Town 
Center s defines the area by allowing a mixture of uses at varying intensities and densities such as 
employment, medium/high density residential, hospitals and /or mixed use developments.     
 
3a. The US 41 corridor , contain ing the City ’s existing shopping area , is an activity center 
characterized by long established retail, office and service uses  and a more recently 
developed larger scale commercial area at the eastern end of the corri dor.  This activity center 
should continue to be developed, with a Mediterranean design theme .  
 
3b. The area around the Sumter/Price intersection is a town center  that serves as a key 
component of the Heron Creek Development of Regional Impact (DRI) . This activity center                                                                                                                          Planning Framework 
                                                                               
 1-5 will contain a mix of uses including government, multifamily , office professional, retail and 
medical facilities.  This area should be designed to be pedestrian oriented . 
 
3c. The I -75 interchange with Sumter Boulevard is another activity center.  This activity center 
will be characterized by highway uses , medical/hospital (on and adjacent to properties owned 
by Sarasota Memorial Hospital) , and retail at lower intensities than those at the I -75/Toledo 
Blade activity center.  The proximity of this activity center to the City ’s primary potable 
water supply source will restrict the types  of uses and intensity of development. 
 
3d. The area around the I -75 and Toledo Blade interchange is an activity center defined by 
highway commercial uses near the interchange, office, and retail . The Panacea DRI, which 
contains a range of land uses from retail and office to light industrial and multifamily, will be included in this activity center.  This activity center will also serve as th e home to the North 
Port campus of Suncoast Technical College .  This activity center will provide the highest 
allowable intensity due to the available land area, surrounding  land uses, and accessibility  to 
the road network. 
 
3e. The Price/Toledo Blade intersection is an activity center characterized by commercial/retail 
uses, multifamily, office and industrial uses, and motels.  This will be a multi-modal activity 
center.  
 
3f.  The area around  I-75 and Yorkshire  Street  has been designated as  Activity  Center  6. The 
designation of this area  was determined through data and analysis contained within the City’s 
Activity Center Report and through public input which , also determined that this location was 
the best site  for an inter change to serve an Activity Center area in the eastern section  of the 
City.   As part of the Master Plan called for  in Policy 2.6.2 of the Future Land Use Element, 
the City shall coordinate with FDOT to identify this location as a future interchange and wi ll 
also coordinate with FDOT, the Sarasota -Manatee MPO, and any other applicable public or 
private agencies to identify funding sources and potential phasing for development of this interchange. The character of this Activity Center is to provide areas of high quality 
employment. 
 
3g. Warm Mineral  Springs shall be developed to take advantage of the unique geographic feature 
of the spring, while serving to protect the natural function of the spring.   
 3h. River Road Office Park shall be designed as a mixed -use development including 
employment, residential, public and commercial uses.  
 3i. W est Villages  Town Center  is a high density/intensity area designed to be a more 
urban/regional commercial, employment, residential area than the  suburban development 
pattern  present in the remainder of North Port. 
 
                                                                                                                            Planning Framework 
                                                                               
 1-6 4.  Gateways  
 A gateway is an area around a point that is an entrance into the City.  The City ’s primary gateways 
are the I -75 interchanges, U.S. 41 at the eastern and western City limits, North and South River Road 
at the City limits ; West Villages Parkway , Winchester Blvd ., and Yorkshire  Street  at the Charlotte 
County line ; the intersection of Hillsborough and Toledo Blade Boulevards, and a future interchange 
at I-75 and Yorkshire  Street . The purpose of the gateways is to provide a sense of entry into the City. 
 To accomplish this, design standards are appropriate. These standards can range from architectural  
features/themes  and special landscaping requirements  to City-sponsored st reetscaping projects  that 
would encompass a gateway or corridor.   
5.  Infrastructure Systems 
 These systems include roads, parks, utilities, schools, drainage, fire/police, open space, and the environment.  These systems help define the quality of life within the community.  As a general concept, these systems should be designed so that they implement several goals.  Examples are as follows:   road system improvements should be designed to implement the gateway and park/open 
space concepts ; schools should be designed to promote/provide a neighborhood focal point as well as 
recreational opportunities , trail or bike/pedestrian bridges should be designed to also serve 
emergency and rescue vehicles , drainage systems should be aesthetically designed to include 
park/open space opportunities and, if possible, to provide a source of potable water.  Also, 
infrastructure systems such as water/sewer, roads, and fire/police need to be phased to guide development, and should be used to accomplish other goals such as economic development, and be financed by creative methods to achieve the goals of the City.  
 
6.  Financial Feasibility  
 Any changes to the Comprehensive Plan should be financially feasible.  Changes to the 
Comprehensive Plan that improve the tax base shoul d be favorably considered, whereas changes that 
negatively affect the City ’s financial health should be considered with caution.  Any improvements 
called for must be financially feasible to implement and to maintain.  An accompanying funding concept is that growth should pay its own way provided the growth supports the Comprehensive Plan.  This concept does not preclude the use of public funds to accomplish a public purpose such as economic development.  To test the financial feasibility of the Comprehensiv e Plan, a planning tool was developed to 
compare the projected capital funds that will be available to the estimated cost of the capital projects necessary to maintain the existing levels of service.  Due to the long- range  nature of this planning 
tool, the numbers should not be used to analyze yearly budgets or five -year master plans.    
 The results of the analysis clearly show that the Local Government Infrastructure Surtax (1 cent sales tax) must continue, and the City must review the existing impact fee s and analyze the 
benefits/impacts of establishing other impact fees.  The Infrastructure Surtax is critical to financing the capital projects.  Therefore, if this funding source is discontinued, the City must review this Comprehensive Plan and amend it where appropriate.   Other funding sources such as proportionate                                                                                                                          Planning Framework 
                                                                               
 1-7 fair share, grants, City TIF, real estate transfer tax, vehicle license fee, public/private partnerships 
may be used to accomplish capital improvements.  The City may support initiatives to modify state legislation that establishes new funding sources.   
7.  Annexation Areas  
 Since the 1997 Comprehensive Plan, the City has annexed the two areas that were identified at that 
time as potential annexation areas .  The only area identified in 1997 tha t has not been completely 
annexed is the area along US -41 from the City’s western boundary to the River Road/US -41 
intersection,  and the SCF campus.  In addition, the Citizen Advisory Committees for the EAR 
showed that the citizens do not want the City  to become larger unless an annexation results in an 
increase in employment opportunities. Since the development of the 2008 EAR, the City has also 
annexed several tracts within the West Villages that were once owned by  other agencies (Pine Street 
and the tract owned by Sarasota Memorial Hospital.)   Also , the Housing Report  concludes that with 
the 2000 annexations , there is ample land area to diversif y the housing stock. The Activity Center 
Report concludes that the land area for tax base diversification is  nearly balanced with residential 
land area.  Since the time of the 20 08 EAR , Mattamy Homes has purchased the entire undeveloped 
West Villages area, including the parcel to the south of the North Port City Limits. Mattamy could, at a future date, consider the annexation of the southern portion of the West Villages  into the City . With 
the land under one owner and with sewer and water provided by the West Villages Improvement District, it would be sensible for all of Mattamy’s holdings to be included within the City Limits .  
Therefore, no further annexation shall be approved other than the US -41 corridor , the SCF campus , 
and the southern portion of the Thomas Ranch, as shown on the Community Concept Map unless the 
annexation clearly benefits the City by diversifying the tax base .   
 Any future annexation shall meet the requirements of the appropriate state laws; in particular  Chapter 
171, Florida Statutes .  In addition to the requirements of state laws, the extension of City services 
shall be economically and financially feasible to ensure the cost of extending services does not 
burden the existing rate payers and property owners within the City limits prior to the annexation.  
8.  Joint Planning Opportunities    
 Several joint planning opportunities extend beyond the corporate limits of the City.  Drainage, traffic 
circulation, hurricane evacuation, potable water, affordable housing , regional trail and transportation 
systems,  conservation lands (eco- tourism) , regional scaled recreational or special use facilities,  and 
schools are examples of the general areas that require intergovernmental cooperation and coordination to resolve problems and to take advantage of opportunities.  Therefore, the City accepts its responsibility in or der to meet  regional needs .  The  City will cooperate with other jurisdictions to 
seek regionally acceptable solutions to regional problems and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise without degrading the unique character of the City, the  City’s quality of life, or lengthening  
the bureaucratic processes.  
 The City shall annually review and analyze the previous actions and events to determine if any changes are needed to the Comprehensive Plan .   
                                                                                                                          Planning Framework 
                                                                               
 1-8  
9.  Community Concept  Map  
 The purpose of the Community Concept Map (Map 1 -1) is to identify the general geographic limits 
of the City, existing and future neighborhoods, major civic centers, activity centers, community parks and major conservation areas.  The Community Concept Map is intended to graphically depict the general development pattern of the City at build -out. Consequently, a planning period date is not 
appropriate.  These concepts form the basis for the proposals found in the EAR and accompanying Comprehensive Plan amendments.  The goa ls, objectives, and policies  further refine, define and 
implement the concepts.  
 
10. Intergovernmental Relationships  
 
In order to build positive intergovernmental relationships the City shall strive to cooperate with other 
governmental jurisdictions on ma tters of  mutual interest and advantage such as mechanisms for 
identifying and implementing joint planning techniques and methods to implement the plans ; 
direct ing development to those areas which have in place the land and water resources, fiscal abilities  
and service capacities to accommodate growth in an environmentally acceptable manner;  respect the 
standards and values of the other jurisdiction;  continued economic sustainability that  strengthens the 
social and economic environment; addressing issue s suc h as  commuting pattern s, cost of living, 
water resources, implementing the City of North Port’s design standards  and infrastructure and 
facility needs.

 2-4 FUTURE LAND USE  ELEMENT  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Future Land Use Element provides direction for managing anticipated growth in the City of North Port in an orderly and balanced manner.  The Future Land Use Element, Future Land Use Map, and the other elements of the Comprehensive Plan are designed to work in concert to ensure that the distribution of land uses will meet the future economic, social, physical, and environmental needs of the City of North Port, thereby increasing the overall quality of life.   
 
BACKGROUND  
 The City of North Port is located in s outhern Sarasota County , sharing common borders with Charlotte 
and DeSoto Counties.  The City of North Port is one of Florida’s platted land communities -the initial 
development of which was begun by the General Development Corporation (GDC).  The first plat of what was then North Port  Charlotte  was approved by Sarasota County in 1959, shortly before the 
incorporation of the City.  After City incorporation, and the election of a City Commission, the other plats  and annexations were approved by subsequent City Commissions. The City boundary history as 
illustrated below  in Figure 2-1 shows how the City of North Port has grown over time. In a very real 
sense, the Sarasota County Commission and the Sta te of F lorida began the development processes that 
resulted in the present development patterns in the North Port area.    Beginning from a population base of under 50 people  at incorporation, the City’s population has 
increased steadily with a large surge  in population growth beginning in the late 1990’s through 2006.  
The City’s estimated population as of the writing of this Comprehensive Plan is approximately 64,472 people, making North Port the 49
th most populous c ity in Florida.  It is anticipated that  under the 
current Future Land Use Map, including platted lots, and approved developments, the population of 
North Port at build out is estimated to be  just over 270,000 residents. The larger population figure 
would be dependent on the northeastern corner of the City that is currently being considered for inclusion into a conservation area being  developed instead.   
 As the City has grown in both size and population, the average age of its citizens  has decreased to 
approximately  41 years of age.  This makes  North Port one of the youngest communities in southwest 
Florida.  The demographic make -up of North Port with a younger population creates challenges and a 
need for a diversity of services ranging from those to serve the very young (schools, day care, park s 
and active recreational facilities, social services) to the elderly (medical, transportation,  passive 
recreational facilities,  social services).   
 North Port was platted primarily for single -family residential development on approximately 95% of 
its total land area, leaving only 5% for multi- family residential or non- residential uses.  Through a 
series of annexations, and the designation of Activity Center #6 in the area of I -75 at Yorkshire Street,  
the City has increased its percentage of non -residentia l, economic development type uses to 
approximately 15% of the total land area, not including conservation and recreation/open space lands.  As North Port’s population has grown, the City has begun to witness the development of commercial and office uses to  serve residents and visitors, a trend that will likely continue at a steady pace.  
However,  the City is still lacking some essential facilities that will be necessary for the growing 
population, including but not limited : to a hospital , multi- modal transp ortation connections , and a 
wider range of business es that would enable the majority of North Port residents to both live and work 
within the City.                                                                                                                              Future Land Use Element

GROWTH TRENDS  
 
As noted in the background section of this document, there are now over  64,472 year-round residents  
in North Port.  From its incorporation in 1959, the City has grown from under 200 people to its current 
population.  Much of that growth has occurred since 1990.  In fact, the City grew over 90% between 1990 and 2000.  Between the year s 2000 and 2016, the City more than doubled its population by 
adding 41,000 people.  Looking at it another way, the City grew by approximately 181.08% per year during that seven -year period. North Port, as opposed to Sarasota County does not have a sizable  
seasonal population.  According to the 2000 US Census, North Port has an average seasonal population that adds an additional 7.6% to its residential population during the winter season (November to April).                                                                                                                                 Future Land Use Element 
 2-6 Figures 2-2 through  2-4a  below illustrate the  development history of North Port from 19 35 through 
2016.  Each dot represents a developed parcel. As noted earlier, over 95% of the City was platted for 
single -family detached residential development until the recent annexations.  Therefore, most of the 
growth indicated on these figures is single -family residential development.  Most of the commercial 
development that had taken place within the City  was in Activity Centers 1 and 2 (see Activity Center 
Report (North Port Planning Department, 2008)  for a fu ll analysis of all Activity Centers, Town 
Center, and Neighborhood C ommercial  areas ). As development opportunities within Activity Center 1 
move towards the redevelopment of the older shopping centers as the limited existing vacant land is developed, comme rcial activity has also begun to take place within Activity Center 5 and in the 
Neighborhood Commercial area at the intersection of Price and Cranberry Boulevards.  These figures 
show how growth has radiated from the original  core of the City and illustrat es the growth patterns as 
development spreads throughout the platted lots.  Figure 4 shows that since the 1990’s, development is 
now occurring in the villages and DRI’s as well as infilling within platted neighborhoods.  It is 
interesting to  note that pre- 2000, the placement of utility trunk lines influenced  growth in areas east of 
the City’s original core.  Subsequently, housing has  infilled between  these lines, albeit that most of that 
growth is still on well and septic systems.  The City, through utilities  master planning efforts, is 
steadily expanding its public utilities which will mean the eventual retirement of many if not all of the privately maintained well and septic systems that are being  utilized today.

Figure 2-5 below is a phasing map  which  illustrates projected growth trends within the platted areas of 
the City as well as non -platted areas such as the West Villages , Activity Centers, and other residential 
developments.  Although it is anticipated that the platted lots will continue to develop in a steady fashion, regional trends indicate that growth within newer developments is taking place at a  faster 
growth rate than the platted lots.  Reasons for this trend include s: a wider  diversity of housing types, 
higher quality infrastructure,  a wide variety of in- community social and recreational amenities,  the 
presence of lighting and sidewalks, current or expected linkages to commercial districts, such as t own 
center s and activity centers. Many of these new developments are required to provide commercial 
areas through the village process . Some developments that are not villages are still utilizing similar 
concepts by encouraging  internal capture  which provides resi dents the opportunity to meet their 
everyday needs in close proximity to their homes.  
                                                                                                                                          Future Land Use Element

 2-11 PLANNING TIMEFRAME  
 
For purposes of this Comprehensive Plan, the City’s planning timeframe is a 10+ year period from 
2017-2030. Any discussions beyond the established timeframe, is conceptual but consistent with the City’s planning for the ultimate build -out of the City.   
 
PLANNING FOR RESIDENTIAL USES  
 
The platted land nature of North Port implies that the majority of developm ent sites are intended for 
single family residential  uses with a typical lot size of 80’ X 125’ or 10,000 square feet.  Prior to the 
2000 annexations , 95% of the City ’s land area was zoned for single family r esidential uses with only 
5% set aside for other uses.  T he City’s annexations have allowed for the potential diversification of 
the housing stock in innovative planned developments, but approximately 2/3 of the City’s platted lots  
remain undeveloped.  To address this, t he City  has initiated a planning strategy  that encourages the 
combining of lots in order to reduce the number of platted lot s. The assembly / and de- platting  of lots 
can create large scale developments that continue to offer alternatives to the single family de tached  
unit and include infra structure and amenities not otherwise available  in much of the platted areas.  A  
successful example of such an initiative is the  Charleston Park  development off of Pan American 
Boulevard.  Although the Activity Centers constitute much of the original 5%  that was available for 
non-residential uses , medium and high density multi -unit residential uses are also permitted within 
Activity Centers, primarily to promote the City’s concept of a live -work community  and to provide a 
wider range of housing options to existing and potential residents .  Specifically,  to Activity Center 5, a 
reduction in medium and density gross acres as part of Figure 1 is proposed.  Currently 9% gross land 
use is allowed for each use.  Since the 2008 Comprehensive Plan update, the Saraso ta County School 
District purchased 52 acres of the Activity Center for a future High School and Elementary School campus  and for a transportation storage facility .  In order to maintain an overall mixed use balance, 
and ensure lands available for light industrial and commercial land uses, a reduction to 4% for both medium and high density residential uses  is recommended. 
 Since the implementation of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan, the City ha d discussed the creation of an 
urban service area boundary along wit h other phasing mechanisms, in order to encourage development 
within areas currently served by utilities or areas where utilities could be reasonably extended to, but 
due to private property rights issues, and economic development interests these initiatives had not been supported. In addition, no portion of the City is located within Sarasota County’s urban service 
boundary.  Although the City had no urban service boundary  designated through the 2008 EAR 
amendments , there are areas in the City’s southeastern corner where major power infrastructure and 
municipal facilities do not currently exist, and is not anticipated to be provided in the 10- year planning 
timeframe, therefore the City anticipates little to no residential development in this area over the 10-year period.  Consistent with these findings, the Utility Master Plan, and other areas of the City 
specified in Policy to not receive City services as part of an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan in 2012, formed the basis for the creation of the City’s  Urban Service Boundary. 
 Following are brief descriptions of each of the City’s residential land use designations as shown on the Future Land Use Map:  
Agricultural, Estates  - These are very low density residential areas that retain the open 
character of the land.  Small- scale a gricultural related uses and low density development are 
allowed in these areas.  The maximum density is 1 residential unit per 3 acres.  These lands are                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-12 primarily located on the City’s north and northeast, with a second area design ated in the City’s 
southwest between River Road and the Myakka River in the Lake Geraldine area.   
 
Low Density Residential  - This land use encompasses the majority of the City’s land area.  
The maximum density for the single family platted lots is 4.3 units per gross acre.  For unplatted areas utilizing this designation, the maximum density is 4.0 units per gross acre.   
 
Medium Density Residential  - Whereas low density residential land uses dominate the City’s 
landscape, there is a minimal amount of mediu m density residential development within North 
Port.  The maximum density is 10 residential units per gross acre.  One of the largest areas is 
located on the western edge of the City’s core, north of US 41 and consists of older/smaller 
units that are conducive to homes for the elderly and as starter homes for young singles and families.  In contrast to the ‘old’ medium density residential, some of the newer developments are incorporating this density via townhomes, single family attached, villas, and duplexes.  An example of this includes Lakeside Plantation, within the Panacea DRI  and the townhomes and 
carriage homes included as part of Gran Paradiso in the West Villages .   
 High Density Residential - These lands are designated for high density residential 
development with an emphasis on multi -family  housing .  The maximum density is 15 
residential units per gross acre, excluding bonuses, incentives, or TDR  units obtained from 
properties in the “sending areas” of the City .  Similar to medium density  residenti al zones , 
there are few areas with this designation in North Port.  Currently, the largest high density development is Holiday Park just off the US 41 corridor.  More recent developments include 
the Lakes at North Port, and Grande Court Apartments (tax credit developments), as well as Willow Creek (elderly only, located within Activity Center 1). In addition, the Toledo Club 
Apartments, while part of the overall Bobcat Trail development, would be considered high -
density residential.   
 Village  - As defined in the adopted City of North Port Unified Land Development Code , this 
classification was designed to promote a traditional, centralized pattern of development similar to the villages and hamlets in parts of the country from where many of North Port’s reside nts 
relocated . It is expected that Village areas will achieve the following goals: E ncourage a better 
job/housing balance; reduce reliance on the automobile by allowing a greater variety of land uses in close proximately to one another (including mixed use  structures) ; protect and enhance 
environmental assets; and provide  for an orderly transition from rural to urban  development .  
Villages are composed of neighborhoods, neighborhood centers, village centers, and possibl y 
town centers.  West Villages and Toledo Village are currently the only approved villages in 
North Port.  The maximum density in these communities is 3 units per adjusted gross acre.  A subset of village is the rural village which would be encouraged in unplatted areas that have the agricultu ral, estates Future Land Use designation.  The gross density within the rural village 
shall be no greater than 1 dwelling unit per 3 acres, with a village center component.   
                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-13 PLANNING FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL USES  
 
As noted earlier, very little land had been set aside for non- residential uses in North Port.  With the 
annexations that occurred since 2000, the City has expanded the land area that could be devoted to such uses, especially tax base diversification type uses.  Other non- residential  uses include: 
 
Recreation/Open Space-  These lands are designated for either passive or active recreational 
uses.  
 Public - These lands are designated for sites where governmental and public activities are 
conducted, including schools. 
 
Conservation- These lands are designated to protect the environmentally sensitive lands by 
maintaining them in a nearly pristine state as aquatic preserves, wilderness areas, wildlife sanctuaries, state forest, or similar uses.  
 Activity Centers - These lands are designated to provide an area for coordinated development 
of industrial, commercial, professional office, residential, public and recreational uses.  This designation provides for a variety of uses where project components and land use relationships are physically and functionally inte grated.  
 During the City’s Evaluation and Appraisal process as part of the previous Comprehensive Plan update , it was expressed that the City needed to examine the existing condition of the 
commercial, office, industrial, and mixed use/Activity Center are as.  Further, the EAR directed 
staff to identify other areas for expansion of economic development opportunities .  As a result, 
an Activity Center Report  has been developed which looks not only at Activity Centers but the 
other tax base diversification type uses. Th e EAR based Comprehensive Plan amendment 
designated a new Activity Center (AC 6) located in the I -75 and Yorkshire Street area.  
Objectives and Policies relating to AC 6 are included in this element.  While  the potential 
impacts of the activity c enter shall  be further examined, the City developed a series of  interim  
guidelines that allows  a portion of the potential development that could occur within this 
activity center area to develop if potential projects were to come online while the City is preparing an overall Master Plan for this Activity Center (Policy 2.6.2).  Designating this activity center as part of the Comprehensive Plan, with the interim guidelines, actually reduces 
the potential impact of development in this area in contrast to what  could have occurred under 
the previous Future Land Use designations while allowing limited development to come online, if proposed while the City prepares the Master Plan.  
 
COORDINATION OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND LAND USES  
 The coordination of urban land uses with the availability of facilities and services , specifically sanitary 
wastewater , solid waste, drainage, and potable water;  is required by the Community Planning Act of 
2011 and identified in F.S. 163.3161.  This requirement is address ed by the le vels of se rvice standards 
established in the North Port Comprehensive P lan policies and five -year schedule of capital 
improvements (CIP) plan.  Each year the capital improvements plan is amended to include an updated five-year schedule of capital improvements , which is contained within the C apital Improvements 
Element of this plan.                                                                                                                                  Future Land Use Element 
 2-14 EXISTING LAND USES  
 
As noted throughout this document, residential is the predominant land use in the City, with 54% of overall gross acres devoted to agricultural estates, low, medium, and high density land uses.  Table 2-1 
below shows the land use breakdowns for the City of North Port.   In total, the City  consists of 66,667 
gross acres, of which 19.8% is built.  Incorporating roads and drainage rights -of-way into the overa ll 
built acres, the City is approximately 23% built and 78.8% vacant.   The Existing Land Use Map (Map  
2-9) is located at the end of the Future Land Use Element.

DESIGNATED AREA OF CRITICAL CONCERN 
The City of North Port does not have any designated areas of critical concern per Section 380.05 within its boundary  
 
REGIONAL DREDGE SPOIL  
The City of North Port does not have regional dredge spoil responsibilities, nor does the City have 
regional disposal site.   The City does dredge its canal sys tems, and the majority of the spoil is used to 
build up/replenish the canal banks.  Excess spoil is disposed of at the Charlotte County Landfill per  a 
letter of authorization (Solid Waste Division, November 2007). 
 
POTABLE WATER  
General Development Corpora tion (GDC) platted large areas in parts of Florida including the City of 
North Port .  The common practice was to install roads  and swales to provide fill for building lots.  This 
practice resulted in approximately 70,000 lots (nearly all of which designated for single family 
residential uses)  with vested development rights that pre -date current State l aws, i.e. in 1972 Florida 
State law discontinued allowing well and septic systems on platted lands less than ½ acre in size .  GDC 
declared Chapter 11 in 1990, whereby the City of North Port acquired the GDC’s Utilities .  Today, the 
City owns the North Port Utilities  Department  which  manages the potable water, wastewater , and 
reclaimed water systems. While North Port Utilities defines the standards and details f or design and 
construction of these systems, because of the 1972 law, new developments are required to design, install, and de dicate  all potable and reclaim ed water and sewer infrastructure for their respective 
development(s) .  Altho ugh wells and s eptic systems are allowed, the Comprehensive Plan calls for 
potable water, reclaimed water,  and wastewater  lines to be expanded to areas of the City within the 
Urban Service Area Boundary.   The City utilizes the master planning process to guide the extension of                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-15 utilities.  Potable water, reclaimed water, and wastewater  facilities are most prevalent in the C ity’s core 
area and radiate out from the core to the platted lots and in newer developments.  The newer 
developments are required to provide their own utility in frastructure and are thus served by potable 
water , and sanitary wastewater which increases their desirability in the market. Newer developments 
are also required to install irrigation infrastructure to reclaimed water standards.  From an 
environmental standpoint, the extension of service s results in a positive impact, and from a fiscal 
standpoint, the City does not initially have to expend City funds to provide this service.  The extension of these  lines to the new developments maximizes the City’s ability to serve the platted lots in the 
future, again through the utility master planning process.  Because of the geographic size of the City, there are logistical issues with developments far removed from main trunk lines, and/or lift and pump stations.  These issues must be addressed either through utility master planning, developer agreements, cooperation amongst multiple developers or other options which should also address the timing/phasing for providing these services. The City’s water sources are the Myakkahatchee Creek, 
CocoPlum Waterway, Myakkahatchee Creek RO Wellfield, and water allocated from the Peace River 
Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority.  The City will continue to identify and explore the utilization of alternative water supply sources , including regional sources, to meet the need of the  
future population.   
 
DRAINAGE  
Drainage in North Port is handled by a system of canals, ditches, and weirs.  These systems are carefully monitored and maintained by City’s Road and Drainage District  and Publ ic Works 
Department .   
 
SOLID WASTE  
Solid Waste collection is handled by the City ’s Solid Waste District with once weekly service 
including recycling.  Trash is disposed in the South County facility off Laurel Road in Venice.   
 
Specific data and analysis for sanitary wastewater , potable water, and natural groundwater aquifer 
recharge can be found the elements and backup data pertaining to each, found within this Comprehensive Plan update.     
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK 
The majority of the transportation and dr ainage network were installed during the original platting of 
the City.  The majority of the roads were developed as local roads to serve the platted lots.  A series of collectors were constructed throughout the City , all of which are  two lane facilities.  The collectors are 
then funneled to the arterial  system s which include two hurricane evacuation routes (Toledo Blade and 
Sumter Boulevard) and U .S. 41.  Although right s-of- way were set aside for the majority of the arterial 
network (and along several coll ector roadways) , it should be noted that these facilit ies, as constructed, 
were two lane facilities , many of which were platted in such a way that individual drive ways 
proliferate and subsequently impact the function of these roads.  This is a challenge t hat all Florida 
platted communities seem to face.  Besides U .S. 41, only one east - west arterial was constructed (Price 
Boulevard) from border to border.  Essentially all of the collector  roads  funnel traffic onto Price 
Boulevard. As the City’s population has grown, the level of service has subsequently dropped.  U.S. 41 
is another arterial roadway that is State maintained and bisects the City east to west along the southern boundary.  U .S. 41 represents the City’s original Activity Center which is nearing buildout at this time.  
Early on, t he C ity has realized the importance of the US 41 corridor and since 1997 has focused a 
number if initiates on improvement the corridor.  These initiatives include  enhancing the corridor 
aesthetically, improving connectivi ty to adjacent neighborhoods, and enhanc ing economic 
development opportunities  along the corridor  through various endeavors including the attempt to                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-16 establish a CRA, yearly applications for grant funding, and the now-sunset citizen boards which 
specificall y focused  on the U .S. 41 corridor.  The last major component of the City’s existing 
transportation network is I -75 which was constructed in the 1970’s, bisecting already platted property 
in some areas.  As a result , platted residential lots actually abut the I -75 corridor creating a unique land 
use challenge in its own right.  The 1997 Comprehensive P lan identified the need for noise 
wall/buffers to mitigate the impact of I -75 on these platted lots, although as of the time of this writing, 
it appears that F DOT may not support or may not have the funds available for such a facility.  In the 
future the City could consider creating a frontage road system along I -75 by converting local roads and 
assembling residentially platted lots to possibly create a commercial corridor or commercial nodes.  I -
75 is an FDOT maintained roadway therefore FDOT is responsible for maintaining the level of service.  
North Ports ’ platted nature, and current lack of major employment opportunities, result in many 
residents use I -75 to commute north  and south to jobs in other communities, thus causing I -75 to 
essentially function as a local road.  The continued development of the Activity Centers combined with 
the ongoing planning and econom ic development effor ts to create interconnectivi ty and transportation 
options , would provide opportunities for the development of live/work community.  The achievement 
of this goal would have a two gold benefit, it would decrease much of the need to use I -75 and would 
increase the quality of live for Ci ty residents.

ANNEXED AREAS  
 The City of North Port was incorporated in 1959 and has grown geographically in size to its current 104 square miles.  When the 1997 C omprehensive Plan was adopted, the C ity was approximately 74 
square miles . Between 1997 and 2005, t he City annexed 7,000 acres of  property known as the 
(Taylor /Thoma s Ranch ) West Villages , which is now designated a s Village land use with a  20,398-unit 
cap.  The C ity also annexed the 9,000 acre Kelse Ranch  in the northeast section of the City , portion s of 
which are designated Village  and Activity Center.  The remaining land in the  northeast quadrant has an 
Agricultural E states  designation per neg otiations  with the then -named Department of Community 
Affairs.  This Agricultural Est ates area offers a  natural gradation of uses from urban to 
rural /conservation land uses . Surrounding this site , bordering the City limits, are c onservation 
easements which encompass a majority of the area to the north and east of the City limits . There are 
natural uplands, the A ldmerman and O range Hammock Sloughs (also indicated as Recreation/Open 
Space) , along with thousands of wetland acres  that connect to wetland systems on conservation 
easements directly north abut ting the North P ort City limits.   As pa rt of the annexation of this land, the 
City considered the water resources that are clearly available as a potential source of potable water for 
the City.  An e nvironmental analysis of this area shows that the wetland systems in this area are in very 
good shape and serve as habitat for a wide range of species  such as wading birds  and mammals listed 
as protected species.  Because the City already has a plethora  of platted lots with a 4 unit per acre 
density, the current Agricultural Estates  has proven to be one of the most desirable areas in the C ity, 
with a majority of the lots already developed at a 1 unit per 3- acre density, which not only preserves 
the natural  environment but f acilitates  movement of wildlife, and offers equestrian and other 
agricultural  type activities.  The No rth P ort Housing R eport  (North Port Planning Department 2007)  
illustrates that the developed  estate properties have some of the  highest market values in the C ity 
overall.   
 
CONSERVATION AND RECREATIONAL AREAS  
 Within the City’s 104 square mile area, there are thousands of acres devoted to conservation, recreation/open space, and park areas.  Bisecting the City north to south is a very important natural                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-17 feature known as Myakkahatchee Creek or the Big Slough  waterway .  The Creek not onl y serves an 
important environmental function; it also serves as a potable water source for the City.  In the original 
platting of the City, the lands abutting the Creek were platted for residential development.  Continued 
development of these lots beyond c urren t levels would negatively impact the potable water, 
environmental, and floodplain functions of  the Creek.  Realizing the importance of this feature, t he 
City’s comprehensive planning efforts have long focused on the preservation of this corridor.  In a 
major initiative, the  City of North Port has purchased all but a few of the platted lots along  the first tier 
of the creek and has been awarded a Florida Communities Trust Grant in order to continue to purchase 
the second tier of platted lots along the Creek.    The City is also unique in that it has a designated State Forest completely within the City limits.  The Myakka State Forest which is located at the City’s southwest border, is approximately 8,592 acres in 
size. In addition, there are 1,488 acres of SWFWMD conservation land on the City’s north west corner  
(Deer Prairie Creek Preserve) .  It is important to note that originally this entire area had been slated for  
residential development.  With the preservation of this land, passive recreation opport unities are 
available for the citizens of North Port and the region, while also preserving significant natural habitat.      
AVAILABLE RESIDENTIAL LANDS  
 The original platting of North Port resulted in the creation of  approximately 70,000 platted single 
family residential lots, all of  which are considered vested and suitable for development .  The typical 
North Port platted lot is 10,000 square feet or 80 x 125 feet in size. As a result, until the recent annexations, options for housing diversity were minimal.  The annexations now allow for a mix of residential uses such as cottage, duplex, single family attached, and on lots of different sizes in order to give developers additional flexibility and residents a variety of options while enhancing their  ability to 
move from one housing type to another as their needs change through time.   Most future development 
of the annexed lands will be guided by the City’s village land use designation/code which encourages internal capture of automotive trips  and the ability  to conduct activities within the development as 
opposed to loading up the regional road network.  The annexe d areas also have the ability to  guide 
development in a fashion that utilizes  and preserves the  natural resources within developments, as 
opposed t o construction on individual lots from the original platted land s which have, and will 
continue to severely impact almost all the natural systems within the City of North Port.  In terms of 
inventory, there are 24,914 gross acres zoned for low density resi dential  uses, of which 6,787 have 
been built upon, leaving 18,127 acres available for development.  There are also 1,828 acres available 
for medium and high density residential land uses. Further, 6,685 gross acres remain for development  
within the agricul tural estates zoning district. 
 
AVAILABLE NON- RESIDENTIAL LANDS  
 As originally platted  (single -family detached residential lots) , approximately 95% of North P ort’s land 
area was dedicated to residential land uses  the balance ( only 5% ) of the area being set  aside for tax 
base diversification type s of development (commercial, industrial, office, etc).  This type of pattern 
placed a significant tax burden on citizens and made it hard for the community to be sustainable.  This 
again was another reason why the C ity undertook the recent annexations -the opportunity to diversify 
the City’s tax base and to diversify housing options. The Activity Center Report analyzed the non-residential areas currently available in North Port, and because of the annexations the percentage of non-residential to residential has increased to approximately 15%, thereby achieving the City’s goal of 
13-17% non- residential  (Tabl e 2-2, below). Please note that this 15% includes the addition of Activity                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-18 Center 6 as designated as part of the  2008 Comprehensive Plan update.  Because it is anticipated that 
AC# 6 will not be developed for a t least 20 years, the City must continue to strive to reach the 17%  or 
possibly 18% , to further increase the City’s overall sustainability. This can be accomplished through 
initiatives, including but not limited to, identification and designation of more neighborhood 
commercial areas, redevelopment activities, and commercial/professional overlay zones in existing residential areas along US 41.   It should be noted that many of the designated Neighborhood 
Commercial land uses are being purchased and/or identified by churches and g overnment facilities.  
The loss of these areas not only affects the overall sustainability and diversification of the tax base of 
the City , but removes these properties from the tax roll.

HISTORIC AND ARCHAELOGICAL RESOURCES  
 The City has a number of historic  and archaeological resources including Little Salt Springs, which is 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  This site is protected and administered by the University of Miami and is owned by Sarasota County .  There are several other archeolo gical sites that 
have a Florida M aster S ite file number, all of which are located within the platted areas of the City , and 
fall under the City’s Archeological Protection code, as well as Florida Statute .  The City has one other 
site (Nona’s Site) , similar  to Little Salt Springs , that upon further study, could be considered for  listing 
on the National Register as well.  This site is under the private ownership of a developer, therefore the 
City, Sarasota County, and local archeologists are working with the landowner in order to purchase and protect this site from potential development.  Another natural resource within the City limits i s the 
City-owned Warm Mineral Springs, which is the  only warm mineral spring in Florida. Its water has 
more mineral content than any spring in the United States and is the third highest in the world.  It  
produces over nine million gallons per day of new waters, coming from over 1,000 meters (over 3,000 feet) deep in the ground, infused with the richest density of minerals of any  known warm water spring 
in the world.  This area also has a recreation/opens space land use designation, but is also imbedded                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element

SOIL AND TOPOGRAPHY 
North Port lies on land that was originally dominated by a series of sloughs with pockets of upland habitat with very little topographic variation.  The elevations in North Port range from 10 feet or less in the south to a height of 31 feet in the City’s northeastern area.  The soil regimes within North Port are typical of those throughout southwest Florida, dominated by sandy- loamy soils.  
 
LAND NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE PROJECTED POPULATION 
 
Because the City is a platted community, there is an excess of land available for low density residential development.  In fact, 37.5% of the C ity’s overall gross acres (including conservation, recreation/open 
space, and park land) are devoted to this land use, or approximately  70,000 residential lots.  Medium 
and high density residential land uses are spread throughout the City, both in platted areas and within Activity Centers.  The designated Village areas offer the potential for a variety  of uses although 
residential still dominates.  The West Villages  area is capped at 20,398 dwelling units at this time, and 
the Toledo Village development is capped at 1,999.  If new V illage areas are designated, they too will 
have a cap placed upon them, which will be reflected in Future Land Use Element policy language, as necessary. The City has two a griculture estates areas  - Lake Geraldine i n the southwest corner of the 
City, and the large  agricultural estates area that dominates the C ity’s north and northeastern areas .  
These agricultural estates lands provide a logical transition  from urban areas to the conservation  areas 
(including the Mya kka State Forest and the Carlton Preserve) located adjacent to these areas.    
 
METHODOLOGY  
To identify the City’s projected residential population, City staff has performed a needs analysis which 
is illustrated below.  The basic methodology used involved the examination of inventory of built and un-built platted lots  and overall gross acres and allowable densities , all approved developments 
including villages, existing DRI’s, Activity Centers, and the estimated population at build -out based on 
the expected uses in each area.    
 The following  Table 2 -4 shows the development that was approved or under review, the number of 
dwelling units and the proposed or anticipated population.  This table shows both the new developments and the old General Development Corp. (GDC) platted lots.  There are approximately 30,334 remaining units approved in new developments and 45,000 platted lots remaining to be 
developed. It is anticipated that, under the current Future Land Use Map, including platted lots, and 
approved developments, the City’s population has the potential to be just over 270,000 permanent residents.                                                                                                                               Future Land Use Element

NEEDS ANALYSIS  
This presents the City’s analysis to quantify the impact of the development approval since the 2008 
Comprehensive Plan update.  In order to understand the potential impact of these approvals, it is critical that we emphasize that a  short- term 10+- year planning period (2017-2030) was used.  Then the 
population projections were compared to the amount of dwelling units that were previously  approved.   
 
Table 2-6 compares the two sets of data in, Table 2-4 and Table 2-5 over the short t erm next 10-year 
planning period ending in  2030.  This shows that the City will have  ample supply of housing units for 
the short and long term planning horizon.  Pursuit to this analysis the City has a need for an additional 
16,529 dwelling units by 2030 to meet the demands of its growing population.  
                                                                                                                              Future Land Use Element

Several thousands of these lots are GDC platted parcels within the eastern section  of the City, both 
above and below I -75 that are without water, sewer, and electricity .  Although development  rights for 
these parcels remain in tact, Comprehensive Plan policies will encourage infill development and 
discourage the proliferation of well and septic systems.  A July 26, 2007 memo from FP&L, shows a  
rough cost estimate for 25,300’ of feeder lines at a cost up to $1,012,000 and 24,738’ of line extension from the feeder lines (which would only serve a fraction of the entire district) at a cost up to $371,070.  Based on comments from FP&L, the City believes that these parcels will develop further into th e 
future.  FP&L position to extend electrical services to the area is demand driven, thus leaving rather large costs for individual lot owners desiring to build.  It is understood that if a property owner  wishes 
to extend power to this area, they are within their rights to do so.  It is the City’s opinion that the probability of such extension is minimal within the timeframe of this plan.  
 New developments typically phase the number of units they build, based on market demand, the extension of the internal utility network,  and for taxing purposes. Although a development may be 
planned for 10,000 units, development is typically incremental  (typically occurring in plats of 100 to 
200 lots) , whereas the platted lands are readily available for development.  In recent years, citizens 
have found the new developments more amenable to their lifestyle, with amenities, interconnectivity, 
and pedestrian friendly design. Further, it is anticipated that beyond the short- term timeframe, the 
supply of new development parcel s will increase within the West Villages .  Therefore, the City,  again, 
would like to see more new development come to North Port to create a more sustainable balance, as expressed in the Housing Element of this Comprehensive Plan.

 2-23 Recommendation:  
 
The excess of pre- platted lots (GDC lots) creates numerous issues relating to the sustainability of the 
community.  In terms of urban sprawl, platted lands communities like North Port and Cape Coral in 
Lee County essentially could be considered as sprawl in and of themselves with acres of land devoted 
to residential uses, often far removed from core areas of the community with little public infrastructure to support them.  It has been proven that development of these pre -platted lots creates a drain upon 
communi ties that must provide service to these remote sections of the community. In North Port ’s 
case, utilizing the N orth Port F iscal Analysis Model NPFAM , it was shown that development of each 
typical platted lot costs more for the City to provide essential ser vices than tax dollars brought in for 
the developed property.  Of course, the size of the structure on the lot will influence the overall tax dollars coming into the City, but the typical 80’ x 125’ platted lot is not conducive to the construction of extre mely large domiciles  that may hold a higher value, particularly since nearly all housing that has 
been constructed within the City is single -story. 
 Although the City recognizes that at this point, each platted lot is vested with development rights and 
most lots are already privately owned, the City wishes to apply a higher priority to infill- type 
development closer to the City’s core and municipal services, and also applies a higher priority to new developments in either un- platted areas of the City or whe re pre -platted lots are assembled to create a 
newer development.  It is expected that the “new” developments will pay for the extension of infrastructure to serve their development, and that these developments will look for unique ways to enhance the City’ s housing stock, add to the City’s non- residential tax -base, and be developed in a 
manner which is environmentally friendly. The infrastructure and other human- scale amenities in the 
“new” developments make them desirable to many people and, on a regional scale the “new” developments are where new citizens are locating overall.  As was stated in the Charlotte County Comprehensive Plan – “… Finally, the market has demonstrated a rapid growth in amenity laden 
developments and a marked slow down in the development of individual single- family lots.”   
 By paying their way to provide for necessary infrastructure, these “new” developments will tend to have an overall positive fiscal impact on the City and, in turn, will aid the City in being better able to secure f inancing for future extensions of infrastructure into the pre -platted lots as they begin to 
develop, in accordance with the parameters outlined in the City’s utilit ies master planning documents. 
Areas for “new” development in the City include, but are not limited to, the West Villages Improvement District, the Heron Creek and Panacea Developments of Regional Impact, developments like Charleston Park wherein pre- platted lots have been assembled and re- platted into a new 
subdivision, and in the northeastern quadrant of the City.   The far eastern section of the City is a good example of the pre -platted lot dilemma.  In this area , 
thousands of platted lots have sat idle for decades .  The lots are accessible by old, substandard roads – 
most of which have vegetat ion encroaching into the pavement.  Most of this area is not currently 
provided with power infrastructure by Florida Power and Light (FPL), and FPL has no immediate plans to provide significant infrastructure , according to correspondence from FPL to the Ci ty.  Of 
course, individuals can pay for extension of power lines to their property at their own expense.  There is no municipal potable water or wastewater  service in this area, and the City’s utilities  master plans do 
not anticipate the extension of servi ces to these areas in the near future unless a developer assembles 
the lots, re -plats, and develops a “new” subdivision while also paying for the extension of municipal 
services to the “new” subdivision. Although Police and Fire/EMS services are available to all areas of 
the City, response times can be hindered due to distance from facilities and road conditions.  Other municipal services including garbage and recyclable pick- ups to remote areas of the City, with limited 
residential density, is also a financial drain on the City.  The City will continue to participate with                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-24 State, regional, and local authorities to develop methodologies, including the viable use of Transfer  of 
Development Rights and lot assembly to address the pre -platted lots issue and to enhance the 
sustainability of North Port and similar communities.  
 It is because of the nature of these pre- platted lots with substandard roads and drainage, no sidewalks, 
no water or sewer, and no human- scale amenities, that the City anticipates that development of these 
lots will extend well beyond 20 40.  The “new” developments with services are where the City 
anticipates new residents will predominantly locate during the City’s planning time frame, and beyond.    
REDEVELOPMENT: THE RENEWAL OF BLIGHTED AREAS  
The City of North Port is a relatively new City.  While most areas of the City are in good condition, the original core of the City (located to the west of Myakkahatchee Creek and to the north and south of 
U.S. 41) have experienced a decline in quality, s ince many of the homes in this area are over 40 years 
old and do not have the size or amenities desired by modern home buyers .  The 1997 Comprehensive 
Plan identified this area as an area of concern as certain elements of blight had begun to emerge at that 
time.   As of 2005, half the structures in AC 1 were built before the 1990’s.  Exacerbating that concern  
was the realization that the C ity’s other Activity Centers would eventually begin to develop and as a 
result could possibly speed the spread of blight throughout A ctivity Center  1 and adjacent residential 
areas which are basically  the original core of the C ity.  After the 1997 Comprehensive P lan, staff and 
citizens assessed the situation in order to stop the spread of blight, to enhance the attractiveness of the area and to create a positive environment for the location of new business es.   
 The City has committed resources to enhance the function of this area since the last Comp rehensive 
Plan, created an Architectural Review Board, and attempted to create a Community Redevelopment Area (CRA) for the entire corridor.  The first step in developing a CRA was to prepare a F indings of 
Necessity Report, per Florida Statutes.  City staff developed a Findings of Necessity Report in 1999.   
The report showed tha t certain elements of blight did exist in A ctivity Center  1, including the 
predominance of defective or inadequate street layout (frontage road and alleyway issues), unsanitary or unsafe conditions (missing sidewalk links, lack of sidewalk lighting, uncont ained garbage,  a lack of 
stormwater retention facilities,  and drainage  issues), deterioration  of site or other improvements 
(aesthetics), and inadequate parking facilities.  Per Florida Statute, since Sarasota is a “Home Rule ” 
County, all CRA initiatives m ust be approved by County Commission.  The County Commission did 
approve the Finding s of Necessity Report  (North Port Planning Department, 1999) , and allowed City 
staff to move forward in the CRA process, which included preparation of a CRA plan and establ ishment of a local CRA boar d (City Commission chose itself to be this board).  With the County 
directive, City staff not only began preparation of a pro posed CRA plan (CRA Master Plan, North Port 
Planning Department, 2002) , but went further and commissioned the development of a U .S. 41 
Corridor Master Plan (Boyle Engineering, 2002) and a Tax Increment Financing analysis  (Burton & 
Associates 2002) .  Upon completion of these documents, the City was informed that the County would 
not support moving forward with a CRA in North Port.  With no formal mechanism to establish a City only CRA, the C ity has taken actions to enhance the corridor and will continue to seek funding sources 
to address older, blighted commercial , and residential structures.  The City has tak en steps to enhance 
the corridor including the creation of the Tamiami Trail Appearance Review Board which is charged with implementing the City’s architectural  guidelines created specifically  for this corridor.  Further, the 
City has applied for and received vari ous enhancement grants which have led to increased landscaping 
and beautifying of the medians and greenways along U .S. 41. The City has also received a grant from 
Sarasota County that  will further enhancement initiativ es including gateway features,  bus shelters, 
paving, and sidewalk connectivity .  The City is working with developers to incorporate initiatives that 
were identified in the U .S. 41 C orridor Master Plan.  Also, various citizen and business initiatives have 
contributed to the enhancement of the U.S. 41 corridor.                                                                                                                              Future Land Use Element 
 2-25  
The City does not currently have uses that are inconsistent with the community’s character and proposed future land uses with the exception of signage located within the U .S. 41 corridor.  The City 
has adopted an ordinance  (02-23) with regards to non-conforming signage on U .S. 41 being brought to 
current standards.    
 Although the boom years of the mid- 2000’s resulted in a considerable increase in the City’s housing 
stock, a substantial amount of that new stock was based on specul ation  or was financed through 
subprime loans and other forms of lending products not commonly used before this period.  As a 
result, during the lowest parts of the post -2005 housing crash, North Port, like most platted lands 
communities, was amongst the co mmunities in the US with the highest number of foreclosures. 
Moreover , numerous homes and commercial structures were never completed, some of  which remain 
half-completed today.  While some of the foreclosures took place in newer communities, the majority 
occurred on platted lots, many of which were not maintained, and were overgrown with vegetation. The condition of the structures underwent rapid deterioration due to a lack of maintenance and 
humidity damage . This resulted in  blighted conditions in some nei ghborhoods that served to lower 
property values, and create d unsafe conditions.  This highlights another issue with the high amount of 
pre-platted lots in the community  - these lots are conducive to land speculation.  The City had to use 
resources  limited by the decline in property values  to ‘clean -up’ numerous lots which had been left 
abandoned, placing an unexpected financial burden on the City . Additionally, the loss of tax revenues 
from these lots added to the City’s financial burden  during this period .  Having gone through this 
experience, the City desires to focus on and encourage ‘new developments’ in unplatted areas of the 
City and in areas where pre- platted lots have/will be assembled to create new developments.  The pre-
platted lots issue not only impacts North Port, but all pre -platted communities in Florida . The City will 
continue to work with State, Local, and Regional governments and agencies to develop methods to better address the impacts and issues related to the presence of pre- platted lots.  
 
QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES  
Quality of life and sense of place are important to North Port residents.  This includes not only the desire of residents to both live and work within North Port, but also includes  such issues  as 
connectivity between neighborhoods, schools, civic areas, and commercial areas/Activity Centers.  
Quality of life and sense of place  also include s but are not limited to initiatives to enhance aesthetics, 
improve safety, enhance mobility, and to provide various public and private recreation al activities.  
The redevelopment initiatives  for U .S. 41 is a good example of actions taken to accomplish these 
goals.  The Heron Creek and City Wide Urban Design Standards pattern books provide developers a 
template to create unique and innovative  buildi ngs to enhance the quality of life in North Port.  The 
utilization of the two pattern books by the  City within Activity Centers , which have different 
architectural and public art  themes  to avoid monotony and to create places of interest , has resulted in a 
higher level of development than what is present in nearby communities and in commercial structures completed previous to the adoption of the pattern books.  The pattern books also address  connectivity, 
lighting, pedestrian amenities and other means to enh ance these areas.   
 
FLOOD PRONE LAND USE ISSUES  
As noted earlier, the City of North Port lies on land that was originally dominated by a series of sloughs intermixe d with some upland habitat.  Development of the City greatly altered the natural 
regime and  flow characteristics.  Today, within the City’s boundaries, there are 164 miles of man -made 
canals that were construct ed by the General Development Corporation (GDC) in the 1970’s.  These 
canals are interconnected with each  other and to the Myakkahatchee Creek.   There are two main east -
west canals, the Snover and Coco Plum canals.  These two canals are interconnected with multiple canals that run in a north  - south direction.  The Myakkahatchee Creek is part of a larger system known                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-26 as the Big Slough watershed.  Because of this, water that fill s this creek from areas to the north (as far 
north as Manatee County) are essentially funneled through the City.   
 The City has experience d severe flooding from unnamed storms, tropical depressions, and hurricanes 
occurring in March 1987, September 1988, June 1992, June  1995, June 2003, and August 2004.  
Severe flooding has repetitively been experienced in the North Port Estate s area and surrounding areas 
along the Myakkahatchee Creek  and in areas of the City south of US 41 .  
 The City’s current Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) issued by FEMA that were effective as of 
November 4, 2016 are the first maps that cover the entire City .  Previous to this time, most of the 
eastern portion of North Port was unmapped.  Because of flood events and the previous lack of flood 
related data for large portions of the City, the City conduct ed a Big Slough Watershed study under a 
cooperative funding agreement with the South West Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). It was complet ed in late 2015.  T hese maps w ere submitted to FEMA for revisions to the C ity’s FIRM 
maps . Based on the updated FIRM Map Series, the mapping of previously unmapped areas within the 
City has served to expand the 100-year floodplain in North Port , primarily along local streets 
connecting to many of the City’s canals.   A more in depth discussion of this study and possible results 
is located in the Stormwater section of this Comprehensive Plan.    In an effort to maintain and enhance the function of the Myakkah atchee Creek floodplain  and to 
mitigate future property loss, the City has taken a proactive role in protection initiatives.  Protection of the Creek has always been a central tenet of the City’s comprehensive planning efforts.  To minimize the effects of development on the floodplain, to minimize the use of well and septic systems  along the 
creek , and to preserve native habitat, the City has secured nearly all of the residential and 
environmental properties directly adjacent to the Creek, flanking both sides.  In order to expand the 
protection area, the City continues to use grant f unding obtained through the Florida Communities 
Trust to purchase platted lots in the second tier abutting the Creek, adding another 150 feet of  
protection.  It is the City’s goa l to create a passive greenway/park corridor on these creek lands.  By 
decreasing the development potential along the creek, the floodplain function should be maintained and enhanced over time, one of the C ity’s primary water sources is better protected, n atural habitat is 
maintained and enhanced, and residents and visitors will have a large park setting to enjoy.  
 
To better protect the floodplain and to increase citizen’ s awareness  of flooding and flood protection, 
the City is an active participant in the National Flood Insurance Program’s Community Rating System 
(CRS).  Because of actions taken by the C ity, it is now being classified as a Class 6 CRS community 
which means that residents in the flood hazard area receive a discount of 20% from there flood 
insurance premiums.   Actions such as canal and drainage system maintenance not only help in 
distributing the flow of stormwater, but also serves as a factor  in reducing the flood premium.  The 
City will continue to participate in the program and w ill continu e to work to improve its  rating , 
resulting in  more savings for North Port residents. 
 
DREDGE & SPOIL RESPONSIBILITIES   
Although North Port is located within a coastal county, the City is not adjacent to coastal or intercostal waterways.  Charlotte Harbor i s the closest water body to the City , however  the City  is not responsible 
for any dredging activities  within the harbor.  T he City maintains 84 miles of major waterway canals 
(most all of which are manmade except for the Myakkahatchee itself), and about 29 4 miles of ditches 
(minor canals or drainage channels – all of which are man -made).  
 During times of waterway/canal 
dredg ing, the resulting spoil is transferred to the banks of the canals to dry.  After an appropriate 
drying period, the spoil is spread on the banks and grass is then placed on top of the dried spoil.  Any excess spoil is taken to and used by the Charlotte County Landfill per a letter of authorization (Solid                                                                                                                             Future Land Use Element 
 2-27 Waste Division, 2007).  In addition, when the City conducts minor canal or drainage channel ( swale ) 
maintenance any vegetation and spoil is taken to the Charlotte County Landfill.   
 
HAZARD MITIGATION 
As already stated, N orth Port is a platted lands community of approximately 104 square miles in size .  
The City is predominantly residential in nature with most non- residential development located in 
unplatted areas such as Activity Centers and the Town Center.  The current population is 
approximately 64,472 residents and it is estimated at build -out to have a year round population of  
approxim ately 270,000 people according to current estimates.   In terms of the coastal zone, most of the 
City lies beyond the Evacuation Zones A and B (corresponding to a Category 1 and Category 2 
Hurricane) (most of it in Cat 2) Storm zones as identified on the Se a, Lake,  and Overland Surge from 
Hurricanes  (SLOSH)  Map issued by the SWFRPC.  These areas are all located to the south of U.S. 41, 
including some of the older neighborhoods off of Biscayne, Pan American, and Sydney area.  Duck 
Key is also in this area.   The majority of the City is in Evacuation Zone C or higher zones, with Zones 
D and E (corresponding to category 4 an 5 hurricane areas) appears to dominate most of the populous and future populous areas, with some populations north being outside of designated zones ).  T he 
Myakkahatchee Creek area will always have issues, hence the importance of the creek project. West of the Myakka River, portions of the Thomas Ranch are within the designated Evacuation Zones A and B , 
which also means areas they are impacted  by the FEMA/FIRM 100 Year floodplain in that area.  The 
most “vulnerable” areas are along and east of River Road . An estimated one  quarter of the West 
Villages are located within Zones A and B .  This w ill require very close review of projects, especially 
on properties near River Road and to the east of River Road.  Future Land Use and Coastal 
Management Element policies should be examined in terms of limiting certain  types of development, 
or requiring buildings to be elevated on stilts  or stem -walls . These changes may also require 
commercial  and office structures to have parking underneath to allow for the free -flow of water and 
lessen the impact of surge or flood events.  Mos t of the City’s  waterfront land that would be directly 
impacted by wave action fro m storm events is  located  in Conservation areas, including the Myakka  
State Forest  and the park land proposed as part of the River Road Office Park  in Activity Center 8 .

 3-3 TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT  
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
The goal of the transportation element is to provide guidance for the  development of an effective 
multi- modal transportation system which optimizes safety, convenience, cost, and pollution 
reduction practices by establishing internal and external transportation linkages between 
residential neighborhoods and activity centers.  
 The City of North Port is a relatively young c ity having been incorporated in 1959.  Of note is 
the fact that North P ort is one of Florida’s “platted lands” communities wherein the original 
developer assembled a large amount of acreage, platted thousands of individual single-f amily 
residential  lots, developed a rudimentary street network to “serve” the thousands of lots, and 
installed  very little other major infrastructure.  In  North Port’s case, after starting from a small 
core area on US 41 , the City , through a series of anne xations, has resulted in the creation  of over 
70,000 platted lots, of which slightly less than 50,000 remain undeveloped. T he Future Land Use 
Element includes graphics that show the City’s geographic growth over the years.   
 
With thousands of reasonably priced, platted single -family  lots available , these  lots are sold  and 
eventually the community grows.  North Port grew slowly, but steadily, through the period ranging from the 1960’s through the early 1990’s.  From 1990 through the year 2007, the City 
grew  from 12,000 residents to over 50,000 residents, with most of that growth occurring after  the 
year 2000. However, f rom mid-2007 to 2010 growth within the City slackened considerably due 
to the “great recession”.  From 2010 until 2016 the average percent population growth in the City 
was about 1.97% , resulting an estimated 2016  resident population of 64,472.  The challenges 
generated by this rapid growth in the early 2000’s are evident today, with transportation being 
one of the major issues . 
 
As noted above,  to access the many platted lots, the original developers of the City constructed  a 
massive system of local roads, most of which would be defined as substandard in quality by current standards.  Along with the local roads , an arterial and collector system was developed to 
funnel traffic into the local neighborhoods  and through the City . Besides US 41, which is a state 
highway, there is only one east/west arterial in the City  - Price Boulevard.  The other arterials are 
Toledo Blade Boulevard and Sumter  Boule vard.  As originally built, these arterials were two -
lane roadways.  In the case of Toledo Blade and Sumter Boulevards, rights -of-way were set aside 
for the eventual widening of these roads.  This was not the case for Price Boulevard, which today witnesses hundreds of homes and driveways directly accessing this two- lane arterial.  A series of 
collector roadways was also put into place, again with two lanes on each.  The majority of the collector roadways run north/south with limited rights -of-way for f uture  expansion, if necessary.  
Any widening to the collector system would have to take into account the impact upon the individual neighborhoods.   
 The other major roadway traversing North Port is Interstate 75. This highway was completed in 
Sarasota County i n the mid -1980’s.  The construction of I -75 actually “split” the City of North 
Port and its road system with most of the north/south collectors ending at “dead ends” next to the interstate. Interchanges were built at the intersections of I -75 and Sumter Boulevard, and I -75 at                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-4 Toledo Blade Boulevard. Ponce De Leon Boulevard, Yorkshire Street, and Raintree Boulevard 
were the only collector roadways that either cross over or under the interstate.  Although I -75 
was intended to function as a limited access faci lity providing for inter -regional and interstate 
travel to and through Sarasota County and North Port, as time has passed and growth has 
occurred, its function has often resorted to being a very large, higher speed, local road.  In North 
Port’s case, the l ack of areas for employment ha s forced a large majority of its  residents to use I -
75 and US 41 to travel to jobs and services in centers  generally north or south of the City.  While 
one of the primary goals of the City since the adoption of the 1997 Compre hensive Plan has been 
to annex land to allow for more areas for jobs/tax base diversification in North Port , subsequent 
actions by Sarasota County (including the purchase of lands to the north of the City for 
conservation uses) has limited the ability to f urther annex. While it is hoped that the annexation 
of lands  will keep residents in the City  throughout the day lessen ing the need for City residents 
to use the Interstate to get to and from work , shopping, and services  in other areas  of the region, 
this e ffect has been limited thus far.  
 
When discussing mobility in North Port, it is also important to discuss the impact of the large 
drainage system in the City.  Over 84 miles of major canals and a larger number of minor ditch 
and swale systems divide s the C ity and creates a transportation network that is not well linked, 
especially on the local/neighborhood scale.  You may be able to see your neighbor across the 
canal, but to visit, you have to generally travel miles nort h or south on a collector, take an ar terial 
east or west, and then head back north or south down another collector to see that neighbor “just across” the canal . While numerous communities built during the same period as North Port have 
similar issues due to their design, the presence of the c anals and  open drainage system makes the 
scale of this issue much greater.   The City must examine linkage  and connectivity during this  
comprehensive planning period.  
 
Transit service with in most of the City of North Port has been minimal.  Sarasota County Area 
Transit (SCAT) , however,  has provided service, primarily along the US 41 corridor , for many 
years.    The citizens of North Port and City officials have  worked with Sarasota County and 
Sarasota County Area Transit (SCAT)  since 1997 to have service expanded, with some success.   
Currently SCAT five (5) daily routes (Monday through Saturday) to Sarasota three (3) of which are express routes. On Sunday SCAT provides two (2) routes to Sarasota. As the population 
growth continues in North Port transit servi ce will expand to meet the shopping and commuter 
needs of City residents. Current transit routes are shown on the Future Transportation Circulation Map.  As the City grows, it is anticipated  that transit will play a major role in moving citizens 
from place to place. City staff recognizes  the need for  transit service and routinely has 
developers plan for transit stops and shelters as part of their development approval s. The ability 
for transit to effectively serve the City, however, may be limited due to the  relatively low density 
development patterns favoring single family residential development. Because this development 
is lower than the 7 homes per acre commonly cited as a minimum to effectively sustain transit 
service, local transit agencies may be reluctant to greatly expand services within the City.  
Nonetheless, the City continues to work with SCAT and with Charlotte County to expand transit 
services into the City and throughout the region.  
 Sidewalks and bikeways are also available in North Port, although they are often not linked, and 
are more likely to be found in the newer developments as opposed to the older platted lots. As                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-5 streets are expanded or rebuilt, the City has taken the opportunity to construct or expand upon 
the existing pedestrian/bicycle network, particularly along arterial and connector roadways.  The 
City is working to address these issues through the development of a complete streets program.  
  There are currently no “blueways” in North Port, although the opportunity exists, on a l imited 
scale, via the canal network, the Myakkahatchee Creek, and the Myakka River.  The C ity will be 
developing a greenway corridor along the Myakkahatchee Creek in the future, and it is hoped 
that eventually linkages can be made with existing County and regional trail systems to the north.  
 The transportation challenges in North Port are significant , and as  discussed , this document will 
continue to guide the City as it strives to address the challenges in order to maintain  and improve 
upon the overall qua lity of life in the community.  
 
 
TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE EVALUATION AND 
APPRAISAL REPORT  
 
 As discussed in  the 2005 Evaluation and Appraisal Report  and noted in the 2015 Evaluation and 
Appraisal Letter , transportation and connectivity remai n critical to the quality of life in North 
Port.  This is evidenced by the fact that transportation was identified as one of the City’s “major 
issues,” which further consisted of 5 major sub- issues under the “transportation” banner.  Since 
approval of the EAR, the City has taken great strides to address each of these issues .  Following 
is a summary of each transportation- related major issue from the EAR, and a brief discussion of 
actions taken since approval of the  2008 EAR:  
 
1. Widen Toledo Blade Boulevard –S ince the EAR, the City has worked with a major 
developer on Toledo Blade and has developed a public/private partnership that resulted i n 
the widening of Toledo Blade from two to four lanes from I -75 to the Charlotte County 
line.  The Charlotte County segme nt was added to the agreement and widened to four -
lanes from Hillsborough Boulevard to US 41.   The widening to four lanes was completed 
in 2010. As part of this construction, an 8-foot sidewalk was constructed on both sides of 
Toledo Blade  within the City  limits and an 8-foot sidewalk was constructed on the east 
side of the roadway on the Charlotte County segment .  
 
2. Purchase rights -of-way, design, and widen Price Boulevard  – Besides US 41,  
Price Boulevard is the only east/west arterial in North Port. It is primarily a two -lane 
roadway today with the exception of some turn lanes and improvements at major 
intersections. A plethora of residential driveways directly access this major road thus 
exacerbating the traffic congestion and falling level -of-service on  the road.  The Citizens 
Advisory Committees made it very clear that this road needed improvement and therefore called for the identification of rights -of way needs, the purchase of rights -of-way, design, 
and construction of a widened Price Boulevard.   Since the completion of the EAR, the 
City conducted a “Price Boulevard Corridor Study,” which examined  the corridor, 
identif ied the needs and improvements, costs, and recommended  alternatives to the 
widening of the road.   This was the necessary first step toward achieving capacity                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-6 improvements and enhanced mobility on and around this corridor.   The Price Boulevard 
Corridor Study was completed in 2009.  
 
As of early 2016, the City is working with its consultant, Charlotte Engineering Services, 
to design and construct the segment of Price Boulevard between Sumter Boulevard and 
Cranberry Boulevard. According to the Sarasota -Manatee Metropolitan Planning 
Organization’s Transportation Improvement Plan, final construction of this segment should take place in Fiscal  Year 2018-2019. 
 
3. Complete Sumter Boulevard – Sumter Boulevard is the other north/south arterial that is 
maintained by the City.  For years Sumter was a two -lane road that ran from Charlotte 
County all of the  way north into the Agriculture  Estates section of the City.  Prior to the 
adoption of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan, the City had completed the four -laning and 
elevating of a portion of the road, including aesthetic enhancements and a beautiful 
gateway feature.  In early 2015 , the City completed  construction of the widening of 
Sumter between  US 41 and I -75.  This project includes aesthetic enhancements and 
frontage road sections in certain residential areas to keep residential driveways from 
directly accessing the widened roadway.  A 12 -foot multi- use tra il was constructed on 
each side of Sumter as part  of the upgrade.  
 
4. Mass Transit – During the 2005 EAR process, each of the Citizens Advisory  
Committees were adamant in stating that the City needed more and better transit service.  
Since the EAR was approved the County’s transit provider, Sarasota County Area T ransit 
(SCAT), has added service in North Port with new routes reaching the new City Center Complex on Sumter Boulevard, and new service reaching far up Toledo Blade Boulevard 
to the Lakes of North Por t Apartments and the North Port Park of Commerce , providing 
service to workers and residents alike.  It is expected that transit service along Toledo 
Blade will be extended to the Suncoast Technical College/Sarasota County Library 
campus once it is complete d. Also, SCAT has provided three (3) commuter service  routes 
from the City Center Complex to downtown Sarasota and SRQ Airport.  
 
5.  Repair the existing road network – As noted in the introduction to this element, the 
City’s original developers put in place a  very large local road network in order to serve 
the thousands of platted lots in North Port.  As time has passed the condition of the roads has degraded substantially in many areas, reflecting the minimal standards that the 
original roads were built to.  Age, weather, traffic by heavy trucks and machinery have 
been making some of these roads practically impassable.  As a result, the City is presently in the first year of a three- year program to repave/rehabilitate the vast majority 
of the roadways remaining that were constructed by the developer.  
 
                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-7 FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF ROADS  
 
The State of Florida utilizes the highway classification system as adopted by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, but local governments are allowed to adopt their ow n stan dards 
for roadway classification.  Following is the classification system utilized by the City of North Port: 
 
• Principal Arterial – a principal arterial is  a controlled access facility with grade 
separated intersections providing for interregional and/or i nterstate travel at high 
operating speeds.  Principal arterials typically accommodate high volumes of traffic.  
Interstate 75 is a principal arterial.  
 
• Arterial – an arterial is a roadway which facilitates relatively long trip lengths at 
moderate to high operating speeds with somewhat limited access to adjacent properties.  
Arterials generally serve major centers of activity and have the highest traffic volume 
corridors.  Policy 1.6 of this element lists the roadways currently designated as arterials in 
North Port.  
 
• Collector - collector roads collect and distribute moderate to high amounts of traffic 
between arterials and local roads at moderate to low operating speeds.  Collectors provide 
for more accessibility to adjacent properties than arterials. Policy  1.6 of this element lists 
the roadways currently designated as collectors in North Port.  
 
• Local Roads – local roads generally provide access to abutting properties .  Local roads 
possess relatively low traffic volumes, operating speeds, trip lengths, and through traffic movement. 
 Table 3-1 below summarizes the City’s roadway system in terms of the number of miles of 
roadway and the percentage of roadway in each functional classification indicated above.  The Existing Roadway Classification Map found at the  end of this element shows the existing road 
network for the City of North Port.  The majority of roads are two- lane local roads.  The 
collector roads in North Port are generally two lanes. As discussed in the section  above, the City 
is proceeding to widen  its arterial roadways to increase capacity, facilitate better traffic 
movement, and to enhance evacuation timing.  Currently, Price Boulevard is a two- lane arterial 
facility which widens only at major intersections. The City has begun the design and permi tting 
phase for the widening of Price Boulevard to four lanes between Sumter Boulevard and Toledo 
Blade Boulevard , and anticipates completion of the Sumter to Cranberry Boulevard segment in 
2018-2019.  Toledo Blade Boulevard and Sumter Boulevard are four l ane divided arterial 
roadways between US41 and I -75. Interstate 75 is in the process of being widened to 6 lanes 
from River Road to Sumter Boulevard, with an expected completion date of 2017. The remainder of Interstate 75 within the City is expected to be  6-laned by 2022. Toledo Blade and Sumter 
Boulevards have been widened to 4 lanes between Interstate 75 and US 41 since the completion of the previous Comprehensive Plan update.  
                                                                                                                      Transportation Element

Roadway Laneage  
 Since the majority of the City’s road network consists of local roads, most of which are the result 
of the City’s original platting, the majority of the network consists of two- lane facilities.  The 
arterial and collector system are also primarily two -lane facilities, although as noted in this 
element, the City  has completed the widening of Sumter Boulevard and Toledo Blade B oulevard 
to four lanes between US41 and I -75.  The City is  proceeding with the design and permitting to 
widen Price Boulevard to four lanes between Sumter Boulevard and Toledo Blade Boulevard  
and to construct the remainder of Springhaven Road from Pan American Boulevard to Price Boulevard. The generalized Table 3 -2 below indicates the existing number of travel lanes within 
the City’s roadway system.

STRATEGIC INTERMODAL SYSTEM  
 
Florida’s Strategic Intermodal System (SIS) was established in 2003 to enhance Florida’s 
economic competitiveness by focusing limited sta te resources on those transportation facilities 
that are critical to Florida’s economy and quality of life.  SIS facilities include interstates, major airports, and major ports.  Interstate 75 is the only SIS facility in North Port .  
 
ROADWAY JURISDICTION AND MAINTENANCE  
 
Section 335.01 of the Florida Statutes directs the FDOT to functionally classify all public roads  
based on current usage and assigns each road to one of four systems:  State Highway System, State Park Road System, County Road System, or City Street System.  The assignment of a road 
to a particular classification determines primary maintenance responsibilities for that road.  
                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-9 Maintenance and operation of roads in North Port is currently divided among three jurisdictions 
– the State (I -75 & U .S. 41), Sarasota County (River Road  and Winchester Boulevard), West 
Villages Improvement District (West Villages Parkway) , and the City of North Port. Charlotte 
County jointly maintains Hillsborough Boulevard with the City  through an interlocal agreement.   
Table 3-3 below indicates the general jurisdictional maintenance responsibilities for North P ort’s 
road network.

PARKING FACILITIES  
 
The City currently  has forty -six on- street parking spaces along the US41 Access Road between 
Biscayne Drive and Pan American Boulevard , and additional on- street parking within the City 
Center along Main Street and City Center Bouleva rd. Individual developments are required to 
meet all parking standards as outlined in the City’s Unified Land Development Code, as amended. As of October, 2016, an additional 24 spaces are proposed along the southern frontage 
road in front of the North Port Library. While private shared parking is encouraged between 
adjoining uses and with uses that operate on a complementary time schedule ( i.e. office buildings 
and movie theaters or churches and uses that need parking on other days of the week) there are few examples of this taking place within the City.  
 The 1997 Comprehensive Plan included an objective and supporting policies to analyze the need 
for public parking facilities along the U.S. 41 corridor.  The City conducted and adopted a U.S. 
41 Corridor M aster Plan  (Boyle Engineering, 2002)  as part of a failed CRA initiative with 
Sarasota County.  However, the City still utilizes the Master Plan to guide development on the corridor as it runs through North Port.  The Master Plan does address parking and re commends 
that the City consider parallel parking along the business side of the frontage roads that line U.S. 41 through parts of the corridor.  The Master Plan also recommends that the City consider “Pod 
Parking” at certain yet to be determined  locations, possibly near future transit or trolley stop.  
 
TRAFFIC GENERATORS  
 
Factors such as family income levels, the number of cars per household, employment, school 
enrollment, and recreational facilities influence the amount of traffic generated in any particu lar 
area.  Also influencing traffic are certain destinations which generate traffic such as major commercial centers, schools, medical facilities, and industrial parks.  
 The platted nature of North P ort influence s traffic generation  patterns .  On a large scale, 
employment destinations north and south of the City influence traffic generation and patterns as most working City residents still have to travel elsewhere each day for employment.  This causes                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-10 a large amount of morning and afternoon traffic on both I- 75 and on U.S. 41.   As the City grows 
and development of the Activity Centers, both old and new, continues it is expected that more 
citizens will be able to live and work in North Port and, therefore some current traffic patterns 
may change.  
 
On a local  scale, the young age of the City  combined with its large  single family  residential 
component have  traditionally resulted in North Port residents having to conduct most of their 
business, shopping, and medical activities in Charlotte County, Venice, and Sa rasota.  However, 
as the City has grown to include over 60,000 residents, new facilities are being developed which will capture outbound  traffic in the future.  T his is evidenced by the construction of the Suncoast 
Technical College campus and adjoining commercial uses at I -75, Toledo Blade, and Cranberry , 
continued new development in Activity Center #5, and the potential  development of a regional 
mall at Toledo Blade Boulevard and I -75. As more traffic is internalized, the continued 
improvement if the City’s transportation network is critical.   
 Some of the most significant traffic generators in the City today are  (please see the m ap at  the 
end of the element ): 
• Activity Center #1 (U.S. 41 corridor)  
• Activity Center #2 (including the City Center Complex)  
• Sarasota Memorial Hospital Emergency Room and Bobcat Trail Commercial  
• Butler Park  
• Price Boulevard s chool campuses and North Port Performing Arts Center  
• Dallas White Park and skate park  
• All schools 
• Social service campus off Pan American Boulevard  
• State College of Florida /University of South Florida ( West Villages Area) 
• Warm Mineral Springs complex  
• Heron Creek Golf facility  
• Bobcat Trail Golf Course  
 
 
TRAFFIC COUNTS  
 
The traffic count table located at the end of this element shows the estimated volume of traffic o n 
the major roads in the City for 2015 .  The Annual Average Daily Traffic Counts (AADT) data 
represents the total volume of traffic on a roadway segment for one year, divided by the number 
of days in a year.  The most heavily traveled City-maintained roadw ays are Toledo Blade 
Boulevard, Price Boulevard from Toledo Blade Boulevard westward, and Sumter Boulevard.  U.S. 41 and I -75 carry substantially higher levels of traffic.  
 
INTERSECTION DEFICIENCIES  
 
As the City has grown in population, traffic levels have also increased. Because of the layout of 
North P ort with the platted lots and miles of canals, traffic is typically forced onto the collector 
roadway system which eventually leads to the limited (in number and capacity) arterial system.                                                                                                                       Transportation Element  
 3-11 It has been found that the intersections of the collectors and arterials are overall deficient.  The 
City has been working to improve many of the City’s  intersections via the use of turn lanes and 
traffic signalization.  Several of these projects have been funded through C ongestion 
Management funds awarded through the Sarasota -Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization 
(MPO).  As the arterial network is widened  to increase capacity, more intersection improvements 
will also occur.  Traffic accidents can also be an indicator of intersection deficiencies.  In 2007, 
the North P ort Police Department registered 860 accidents on City roadways, most of which 
occurred at or near major intersections.  
 
ROADWAY LEVELS OF SERVICE  
 
The determination as to whether the existing roadway can adequately serve the existing and 
future demands is predicated on the ability to estimate the maximum amount of traffic a roadway 
can safely accommodate.  The establishment of threshold standards for roadway types or levels 
of service (LOS) are used to identify needed system improvements, either by expansion of 
existing roadways, constructing new roadways, creating parallel roadways, or the use of 
alternative modes of travel.  
 
The principal objective of capacity analysis is to estimate the amount of traffic that can be 
accommodated by a given roadway.  However, capacity analysis is best used to estimate the traffic -carrying ability of a given roadway over a range of defined operational conditions, using 
level of service criteria.  Roadways do not operate well at capacity because they are not designed to that optimal standard.  
 The concept of level of service is defined as a qualitative measure describing operational 
conditions within a stream of traffic and the perception of those conditions by motorists and 
passengers.  A level of service category generally describes these conditions in terms of speed 
and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience, and safety.  
There are six levels of service – with LOS “A” representing t he best operating condition and 
LOS “F” the worst.  Operating conditions under these LOS standards (as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual  2010, Transportation Research Board) are:  
 
• LOS A:  Motorists are unaffected by the presence of others in the strea m of traffic.  
Freedom to travel at desired speeds and to maneuver within the stream of traffic is extremely high.  The general level of comfort and convenience is excellent.  
 
• LOS B:   Freedom to travel at desired speeds is relatively unaffected, but there is a 
reduction in the freedom to maneuver within the stream of traffic.  The level of comfort 
and convenience is less, because of the presence of others in the stream of traffic begins 
to affect individual motorist behavior.  
 
• LOS C:   Motorists become signi ficantly affected by the interactions with others within 
the stream of traffic.  Traveling at the desired rate of speed is affected and maneuvering 
within the stream of traffic requires substantial effort on the part of the motorist. Comfort 
and convenienc e decline noticeably at this level.  
                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-12 • LOS D:   Speed and freedom to maneuver are severely restricted, and a poor level of 
comfort and convenience is experienced by the motorist.  Minimal increases in traffic 
will generally cause operational problems at this level.  
 
• LOS E:   Operating conditions are at or near capacity.  All speeds are significantly 
reduced.  Freedom to maneuver is difficult.  Comfort and convenience are extremely poor 
and motorist frustration is generally high.  
 
• LOS F:   Operating conditions at  this level are forced or have broken down.  This 
condition exists wherever the amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount 
that can traverse the point.  Queues typically form at such locations.  Operations are 
characterized by stop -and-go waves; vehicles may proceed at reasonable speeds for short 
distances and then be required to stop in a cyclical fashion.  Comfort and convenience are extremely poor and frustration is high.  
 These definitions are general and apply primarily  to roadways having  uninterrupted traffic flows, 
such as freeways.  For each type of roadway facility, levels of service activities are based on one or more operational parameters or “measures of effectiveness.”  Basic measures of effectiveness 
used to define levels of servi ce for different types of roadways include: (a) average travel speed; 
(b) density; (c ) delay ; and (d) volume.  
 
State Highway System Levels of Service  
 In 2013, FDOT adopted revised quality/ level of service ( Q/LOS) standards for roads on  the State 
Highway S ystem. These standards are used by FDOT to evaluate roadways from a multimodal 
perspective, which results in better multimodal decisions for projects in generalized and 
conceptual planning phases. The Q/LOS standard assists FDOT in determin ing system 
deficiencies , determining work program priorities, review ing local  government and metropolitan 
planning organization comprehensive transportation plans, and review ing traffic circulation 
impacts related to Developments of Regional Impact  (DRI’s) and other devel opment affecting 
the State Highway System.  The 2013 State Highway System Q/ LOS standards are intended to 
further the overall  concept of growth management. In addition to the previous level of service 
standards, along with the service or “capacity” volumes associated with the  various LOS 
designations a new component “Quality of Service” (QOS) has been added. The QOS 
component is a traveler based perception of how well a service or facility is operating.  The 
Q/LOS standard continues to promote or encourage development in existing urban areas,  the use 
of public transit, bicycling, or other alternative modes of transportation, and the  efficient use of 
existing highways. These standards more clearly recognize the  importance of the different 
functions (i.e. mobility versus access) provided by roads on the State Highway System, and the 
importance of exclusive transit facilities within the  State Highway System. The 2013 standards 
recognize or acknowledge the acceptance of some highway congestion as a trade -off for o ther 
urban area amenities and the fact  that necessary improvements to  many roads on the State 
Highway System are  constrained due to physical or policy barriers or are backlogged beyond 
current 5 -Year  Work Programs.  
Transportation and Community Connectivity                                                                                                                       Transportation Element  
 3-13 FDOT adopted a new policy October 9, 2015, which established LOS standards  for the State 
Highway System.  This policy indicated it was FDOT’s intent to “… plan, design, and operate 
the State Highway System at an acceptable level of service for the traveli ng public. The 
automobile mode level of service standards for the State Highway System during peak travel hours are “D” in urbanized areas and “C” outside urbanized areas. No specific level of service 
standards is established for other highway modes (e.g.,  bus, pedestrian, bicycle).  Quality/level of 
service for these modes is determined on a case by case basis”.    
Traffic Concurrency Management Areas (TCMA) are urbanized areas where intensive  
development is allowed and higher levels of traffic congestion are accepted. TCMAs  are 
designed to promote urban amenities and mixed- use areas. The minimum LOS for  roads located 
in designated TCMAs is LOS “E .” The minimum LOS for all roads with backlogged or 
constrained conditions is the current  LOS with minimal degra dation. Backlogged improvements 
are not funded in FDOT’s  5-Year Work Program. Constrained conditions exist when 
improvements are prohibited due to physical or other policy limitations.  
 In 2011, the State of Florida substantively modified many of its growt h management regulations. 
As part of this process, the State removed all level of service requirements related to the State’s roadway system. While FDOT has eliminated Level of Service requirements, the City has chosen 
to continue to maintain LOS requireme nts for roadways located within the City in order to 
prioritize roadway improvement projects.  
 
Existing Level of Service Standards  
 In Sarasota County, LOS analysis is based on a theoretical 100th highest hour —i.e. the traffic  
conditions in the 100th hour  if all hours of traffic in a year were ranked from highest to lowest. 
The first 29 hours are generally considered “event related” traffic. This could be  Memorial Day 
or 4th of July peak on a road serving the beaches. For another part of the  network, it could be 
unusually high traffic redirected to surface streets due to a crash on  I-75. The 30th highest hour is 
considered the highest “normal” traffic, equivalent to the  heaviest PM peak hour traffic during 
peak season. This is often used for road design. 
Transportation and Community Connectivity  
For consistency, Sarasota  County, the City of Venice, and the City of North Port  have adopted 
the 100th highest hourly volume design for  LOS determination. The 100th highest hour is 
roughly equivalent to an average P M peak hour during peak season.  
 
The achievement of the above standard would provide an acceptable compromise  between 
economic efficiency and the availability of adequate service levels . This factor  takes into account 
the unique nature of the region’s seasonal population fluctuations  and the resulting peak periods 
of traffic volumes. It represents a community tolerance level which equates to accepting deficient 
conditions for approximately two hours per  day: (a) every Friday afternoon throughout the year; 
and (b) every Wednesday through  Friday afternoons during the winter season at urbanized 
locations. 
 
The LOS standard described above provides an overall goal toward which the City and  County 
can strive. However, the adoption of a LOS “C” peak hour for const rained and  backlogged                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-14 roadways would not be financially feasible based on a 100th hour design criteria. Constrained 
roadways are defined as exhibiting a LOS lower than the  adopted standard and not being able to 
attain the adopted standard, because prohibit ive cost or environmental limitations prevent the 
construction of at least two  additional through lanes. Backlogged roadways are defined as 
roadways operating below the adopted standard which do not have prohibitive financial or  
environmental constraints but are not scheduled for major capacity improvements in the  Five-
Year Schedule of Capital Improvements. The LOS for constrained roadways (i.e. prohibited due 
to physical or other policy limitations) or backlogged roadways (i.e. currently un- funded in the 
Five- Year Schedule of Capital Improvements)  is to maintain the current LOS with minimal 
degradation. 
 
The adoption of a LOS standard for State roadways must consider the standard adopted by 
FDOT. The City’s acceptance of constrained and backlogged roadways on the State and  County, 
and City  systems, presumes an additional responsibility on the part of the C ity in its  review and 
approval of development orders. North Port has chosen to not require a LOS  for these roadways 
above and beyond the state requirements  due to the costs that would be involved in maintaining a 
Level of Service above and beyond the requirement  set forth  by FDOT.  
 
The analysis of existing LOS (see Traffic Count Table and LOS Map at the end of this element) 
for major roads in North Port indi cates that the City’s arterial road system that  has no links 
operating at an LOS less than the LOS “D” standard.  Toledo Blade Boulevard is shown to operate at an LOS of “B” for most of its length.  All segments of Sumter Boulevard were shown 
to operate at  an LOS of “B” as well. Price Boulevard exhibits a failing level of service between 
Sumter Boulevard and Toledo Blade Boulevard.  The 2009 Corridor Study examined the corridor, identi fied the needs and improvements, calculated the cost of improvements , and  
recommended alternatives to the widening of the road.  This is the necessary first step toward achieving capacity improvements and enhanced mobility on and around this corridor.   The 
segment of Price Boulevard, between  Sumter Boulevard and Toledo Blade Boulevard is in the 
design and permitting phase for widening to four lanes.  Concerning collector roads, only two 
segments of Biscayne Drive at the adopted LOS “D”. All other collector road segments are 
operating at a higher LOS than “D”. Alternatives to maj or road widening on the collectors 
include but are not limited to turn lanes, traffic calming, mass transit. Neighborhood linkage via bridging of canals will be considered to maintain or enhance traffic flow on these roads.  This 
comprehensive plan will propose that the City undertake a City- wide multi- modal transportation 
study to identify future transportation needs and alternatives for addressing those needs.  
 
In the western part of the City, near West Villages, River Road continues to operate at LOS “D ” 
and “E.”  This is a County- maintained facility that also serves as an evacuation route for the 
Englewood area and Cape Haze peninsula.  This roadway is  designated as an “urban arterial by 
Sarasota County,  and it is highly important that the City, Sarasota County, and the W est Villages

Concurrency Management  
 In 1990, the City adopted a Concurrency M anagement Ordinance ( Ordinance # 90-28) as part of 
its Unified Land Development Code.  The ordinance implements the LOS requirements established by the City’s Comprehensive Plan, as amended.  The intent of the Concurrency 
Management Ordinance is to ensure that development orders issued by the City do not result in a 
reduction in any of the City’s adopted level of service standards (in this case for roads) as adopted in the Comprehensive Plan. The City has chosen to maintain the Level of Service 
requirements despite the elimination of concurrency  requirements by FDOT.  
 
Proportionate Fair Share  
 In November 2007, the City adopted a Proportionate Fair Share  Ordinance (Ordinance # 07-38). 
The objectives of this ordinance are:  
 
• Provide a method by which impacts of development on transportation facilities  can be 
mitigated by cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors;  
 
• Allow developers to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure  of 
transportation concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair share of the  cost of a 
transportation facility;  
 • Contribute to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promote a strong 
commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby  reducing the potential for moratoria or 
unacceptable levels of traffic congestion;  
 • Maximize the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve  future growth, 
and in certain circumstances, allow the C ity to expedite  transportation improvements by 
supplementing funds currently allocated for  transportation improvements in the capital 
improvement element.  Community Connectivity  
                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-16 The proportionate fair -share progr am is applicable to all developments that impact a road 
segment in the City Concurrency M anagement System and have been notified of a failure to 
achieve transportation concurrency on a roadway segment or segments.  The Proportionate Fair 
Share program does  not apply to DRI’s using proportionate fair share under 163.3180(12), 
Florida Statutes, developments meeting the de minimis  standards under 163.3180(6), Florida 
Statutes, or to developments exempted from concurrency per Ordinance No. 07-38.  
 
Mobility Fee s 
 At present, the City has utilized Transportation Impact Fees on new development to pay for the 
roadway impacts that these developments create. An issue that has arisen is that Transportation 
Impact Fees can only pay for highway capacity improvements. Under state law, these fees cannot 
be reallocated to other transportation related projects that would benefit the City while limiting 
the need to further widen roadways.  
 To address this shortcoming, numerous local governments (including Sarasota County and  the 
City of Sarasota) have replaced Transportation Impact Fees with a Mobility Fee model.  The structure of a Mobility Fee program is to recognize that there are numerous ways to address 
transportation concerns based on community needs. While the widening  of roadways and new 
roadway construction may be a part of this process, mobility fees allow for a wider range of transportation projects, including transit, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and multi -use trails can be 
utilized to meet local transportation needs.  North Port is considering the adoption of such a 
program and expects to do so by 2019.  
 Access Management Strategies  
 Through its development review process , implementation of the Comprehensive Plan and 
Unified Land Development Code, the City strives  to incorporate access management strategies to 
reduce traffic and pedestrian impacts by incorporating good design principals.  Strategies include 
but are not limited to cross access easement, use of frontage road s and alleyway systems, 
eliminating or minimizin g the number of road cuts accessing major roads  (arterials/collectors) , 
mass transit and related facilities, sidewalks, bike lanes, pedestrian bridges, traffic and/or 
pedestrian bridges linking neighborhoods to other neighborhoods or activity centers, and the use 
of crosswalks and pavers.  
 U.S. 41 Corridor Master Plan  
 In 2002, the City, with Boyle Engineering, created and adopted a U.S. 41 Corridor Master Plan 
to help guide development along this important corridor.  The master plan addressed issues including urban design and landscaping, utilities, drainage and stormwater and various 
components relating to transportation facilities.  Transportation -related initiatives recommended 
in the M aster Plan include completion of the U.S. 41 frontage road system and the reconfiguring 
of the system to make it more business -friendly by moving the roads closer to businesses and 
allowing parallel parking adjacent to the businesses; creation of “pod parking” areas  at various locations to serve businesses and to compl ement transit or a future trolley system; analyzing the 
feasibility of developing a U.S. 41 trolley system with crossover bridges and eventual                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-17 connections from U.S. 41 to other City Activity Centers and, possibly, other nearby 
communities.  
 The U.S. 41 Corridor Master Plan was originally intended as a supplement to a CRA Plan (North 
Port Planning Department, 2002)  for the corridor.  However, the Sarasota County Board of 
County Commissioners, who had the ultimate authority to create a CRA since Sarasota County, 
is a “home rule” county, decided not to establish the corridor as a formal CRA.  The City, 
however, does continue to utilize the master plan when reviewing development proposals in order to implement as much of the plan as is feasible without TIF funding.  
 
TRANSPORTATION AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT  
 
The City’s two main evacuation routes  to Interstate Highway 75 are Sumter  Boulevard and 
Toledo Blade Boulevard.  A map at the end of this element shows the City’s current evacuation 
routes and shelter locations.  
A third evacuation route for North Port communities we st of the Myakka River is River Road  in 
unincorporated Sarasota County outside the City’s jurisdiction. The County is identifying 
funding for a design to widen River Road from two to four lanes, and the We st Villages 
Improvement District may contribute to the design study.  Development of West Villages is 
limited to a maximum at 20,498 units , with approximate ¼ of the total lots either having been 
built upon or approved for development . The continued development  of the West Villages  will 
significantly affect evacuation times on River Road, which presently is a two- lane road with 
limited capacity that also serves as an evacuation route for East Venice, Englewood and other 
Charlotte County communities.  
The US41/River Road intersection was recently widened by a joint partnership between Sarasota 
County, the City of North Port and the West Villages Improvement District. The widened 
intersection will accommodate the future widening of River Road.  
As Thomas Ranch is developed, other roads will be extended to hopefully aid the process. Pine 
Street will be extended north to US 41 and Winchester Boulevard will be extended as “West 
Villages Parkway,” eventually linking with River Road north of U.S. Highway 41. Manasota Beach Road will be extended east into West Villages to River Road, which should help to move 
evacuation traffic more quickly to River Road and I -75. 
The State, and particularly the southwestern region of Florida that includes North Port, 
experienced a surg e in population growth throughout the 1990s and in the first decade of the 21st 
century. The level of service of Interstate Highway 75  has perceptibly and significantly 
declined along with this growth. Consequently, the ability of I -75 to handle a mass or even a 
partial evacuation has been called into question, even as the highway is widened to six lanes 
within the City.  
The 2010 Hurricane Evacuation Study for Sarasota County prepared by the Southwest Florida 
Regional Planning Council is the most current source of information available to determine 
evacuation times.  The study utilizes two primary factors to determine evacuation times : (1) the 
number of vehicles leaving a zone , and ( 2) the capacity of route(s) and the storm category, the 
longer the time it w ill take to evacuate.                                                                                                                       Transportation Element  
 3-18 Evacuation times are express ed in the number of hours needed to move cars (and people) past a 
given point.  Table 3-5 below shows the 2001 Time to Clear Landfalling Storms in and near 
North Port  (this includes portions of the Englewood and Cape H aze area as broken up in the 
Study).

FUTURE GROWTH AND TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS  
As noted earlier in th e “laneage” section of this  element, the City has over 8 00 square miles of 
roads.  Since transportation and specific road improvements were identified in the “Major 
Issues” portion of the EAR, most of the City’s future roadway improvements focus on Toledo 
Blade Boulevard, Sumter Boulevard, and P rice Boulevard. Also, the City is repairing and 
repaving miles of local roads in order to enhance the quality of life for the traveling public.  Since these improvements have been discussed at length earlier in this and other elements of the Comprehensive Plan, this section will focus on other potential improvements.  
 
Interchanges – As identified in  the Activity Center Report (North Port Planning Department, 
2008) , the City is in the planning process for the development of  an Activity Center at Yorkshire 
Street and I -75. This location will eventually need an interchange  to serve the industrial, 
commercial, office, residential, and park uses that are proposed.  This is consistent with the 1997 Comprehensive Plan, which called for a future interchange in the vicinity at  Yorkshire Street or 
Raintree Boulevard.  Staff believes that the spacin g of an interchange is appropriate as it is 
essentially equidistant between the interchange at Toledo Blade Boulevard in North Port and the 
Kings Highway interchange in Charlotte County.  The Activity Center R eport discusses 
anticipated costs and possible funding sources for this future interchange.  This interchange is not currently programmed by FDOT  or identified in either the Sarasota -Manatee MPO or 
Charlotte County- Punta Gorda MPO Long Range Transportation Plan , which means that the City 
will have to c oordinate planning activities with FDOT to address the needs, costs, and funding 
associated with this future interchange (see Policy 2.6.9 of the Future Land Use Element) .   
 
Connectivity – One of the existing problems concerning the ability to move around North Port is 
the impact that the major canal system has on the transportation network.  These water bodies create barriers and force even more traffic on to the collector to arterial “funnel” that is prevalent 
in North Port today.  The City should encourage linkages from neighborhood to neighborhood and from neighborhoods to activity centers and town centers.  One such improvement would be 
the development of the final section of Springhaven Road that would serve to divert traffic away from Price Boulevard i n the western part of the platted lands section of the City.   Such                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-20 connectivity/linkage will offer alternate routes for residents, could aid in maintaining acceptable 
levels of service on certain roadways, better access and make it easier for Fire/EMS and police to 
respond to calls.  Connectivity/linkages could include pedestrian bridges, traffic bridges, or a combination of both.  
 
Sidewalks/Pedestrian Paths/Bike Lanes/Greenways/Trails /Blueways  
Sidewalks in the City are more prevalent in the newer developments as the City  was largely 
developed in an era where sidewalks were not considered essential by the development 
community. However, there are some areas of the city (mainly in the first parts of the City to be 
developed) where pedestrian amenities were in stalled.  The Unified Land Development Code 
requires sidewalks to be included as a part all new developments.  The development review 
process ensures that the facilities are included in the new developments.  The City annually 
attempts to provide more sidewalk facilities and has taken advantage of various grants to 
increase the size of the system to enhance linkage.  Connections to schools, including pedestrian 
bridges across drainage features , are highly important .  
Designated bike paths are found along U.S . 41 and several collector roads.  As arterial roads 
have been widened or are planned to be widened, multi -purpose paths are included in the design, 
including along Toledo Blade Boulevard, Sumter Boulevard, and Price Boulevard.  
Pathways are encouraged in new developments to provide recreational opportunities, or places to 
unwind from a hectic day of shopping. Pathways are being placed around retention areas and 
ponds along with other aesthetic and pedestrian amenities that will make the walk more pleasant.  
Paths and trails will be an important component of the Myakkahatchee Greenway project that is discussed in depth in other elements of this Comprehensive Plan.  A linkage to the Sarasota County trail system on the Carlton R eserve is encouraged.  
The City is  in the beginning stages of creating a Complete Streets Policy that is anticipated to tie 
into a Complete Streets design document similar in nature to the Urba n Design Standards Pattern 
Book. 
The City has inaugurated its blueway syste m, as identified in th e Blueways Masterplan , and will 
continue to do so as funding is available.  
 
Sarasota/Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization  
The Sarasota/Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) was established in 1978 
following the passage of the Federal Highway Act of 1974.  The MPO’s purpose is to guide local 
decision making on transportation issues by establishing regional transportation priorities, 
policies, and plans.  The MPO policy board is comprised of local elected officials from Sarasota 
and Manatee Counties, local municipalities, Port Manatee, and the Sarasota -Bradenton Airport 
Authority. 
The principle responsibilities of the MPO include the development of (1) a 25- year Long Range 
Transportation Plan  (LRTP)  (Renaissance Planning Group, 2015),  (2) a C ongestion Management 
System (CMS), (3) a five -year Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), and (4) related 
planning studies and projects deemed necessary to address transportation issues within their 
jurisdiction.  Local transportation needs are re -evalu ated annually.                                                                                                                       Transportation Element  
 3-21 By Federal and State law, all multi -modal transportation improvement projects must be included 
in and consistent with the TIP in order to be eligible for Federal and State funding.  This 
requirement makes the TIP the primary plan that guides  all State and Federally funded 
transportation improvements in the bi -county area.  
Every five years the MPO updates the Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), with the current 
2040 LRTP adopted in December  of 2015.   The plan defines strategic transportation projects 
linked with growth and important community objectives along with the ability to meet long- term 
mobility needs with projected funding.  The 2035 Highway Needs System Plan for Sarasota 
County (Map 14 of the 2040 LRTP) indicates several improvement s needed for the future in the  
North Port Area, including:  
• Four- laning of River Road.  
• Four- laning Toledo Blade Boulevard (done).  
• Complete the four -laning of Sumter Boulevard (done).  
• Extending Manasota Beach Road eastward to River Road (indicated on Future 
Transportation Circulation Map).  
• Pine Street extension . 
• West Villages Parkway Extension to Winchester Blvd.  
• Four- laning of Price Boulevard (corridor analysis is done).  
• Keyway Road extension to Pine Street (indicated on Future Transportation Circulation Map). 
• I-75 Interchange at Yorkshire Street  
 
ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION  
Mass Transit  
Sarasota County Area Transit (SCAT) provides public transit and paratransit services throughout 
the County, including the City of North Port.  SCAT updates the Sarasota County Transit 
Development Plan (TDP) annually.  The TDP recommends how the bus system can respond to 
the public transit needs of the County over five -year periods.  Through the annual update of the 
Sarasota County Transportation Disadvantaged Plan, SCA T plans for complementary paratransit 
services.  
Since 1997, the City has continually worked with SCAT for enhanced transit service to better serve the needs of City residents.  In fact, this was one of the major issues identified in the 2005 
Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR)  and the subsequent 2012 Evaluation and Appraisal 
Notification Letter .  Since the 2005 EAR  amendments were adopted and approved, SCAT has 
increased service to North Port .  SCAT has also initiated commuter routes to Sarasota Memorial 
Hospital in Sarasota, PGT, Industries in Venice and to Sarasota -Bradenton Airport. The current 
SCAT bus routes are indicated on the Future Transportation Circulation Map.  
The City continues to plan for expanded transit service by requiring developers to pl an for stops 
and shelters in their developments.  Shelters and the communication of real -time transit                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-22 information are also an issue of concern  for transit users .  The City must continue to coordinate 
with SCAT to identify and place shelters at the most used locations in the City , as well as to have 
real-time transit information not only available for mobile devices but also at shelters.  It is also 
likely that in the future, as service levels increase, the City will need a site for a transfer  facility 
for m ultiple buses/transfers.   
North Port also has a number of taxicab and limousine companies that provide door -to-door 
service throughout the area.  Additionally, there are nursing homes, medical facilities, and social 
service agencies that provide services to residents and clients.  
Air Service 
North P ort does not have an airport within its boundaries.  However, the City’s growing 
population has several options for both commercial and private service within a few hours 
driving time.  The closest commercial airports are Sarasota -Bradenton International Airport and 
the Punta Gorda  Airport.  Sarasota -Bradenton International Airport is served by a number of 
national and international carriers (mainly seasonal), and the Punta Gorda  Airport has service 
from multiple  cities from  several low fare carrier s, mainly serving tourists in secondary markets  
or secondary airports in major markets, similar to the role the Punta Gorda airport has in relation 
to Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers.  The City should support initiatives 
that enhance air service at these airports  with fare structures amenable to residents’ financial 
abilities.  A larger range of  commercial airline services are available at both the Southwest 
Florida International Airport near Fort M yers and Tampa International Airport, while  St. 
Petersburg/Clearwater Airport  serves a market niche (albeit on a larger scale) similar to that of 
the Punta Gorda Airport .  
Non-commercial airports for private pilots and charter service are available at the Punta Gorda  
Airport, Venice Airport, and Buchan Airport near Engl ewood. 
 
INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION 
The City coordinates with several governmental entities to ensure an appropriate  management of 
transportation needs. The main agencies are:  
• Florida Depa rtment of Transportation (FDOT) coordinates federal and state funding for 
roadways and improvements with the recommendations of the  Metropolitan Planning 
Organization. 
 
• Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council (SWRPC) assists the City with technical 
transportation information to ensure that local and regional transportation concerns, 
safety, and other issues are met to address growth as it relates to  transportation needs.  
 
• Sarasota/Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) prepares the Long Range 
Transportation Plan (LRTP) containing strategies and projected transportation needs and 
roadway projects within a 25- year frame. The MPO  assists FDOT by preparing and 
prioritizing the financially feasible roadway  projects listed in the 5 -year Transportatio n 
Improvement Program that is utilized  by FDOT for funding projects.  
 
• Charlotte County/Punta Gorda MPO  
                                                                                                                      Transportation Element  
 3-23 • Charlotte County Public Works  
 
• Sarasota County Area Transit System (SCAT) provides countywide transit  services. 
Coordination for bus route services and transit stops is vital to the City.  
 
• Sarasota County coordinates with the City on all roadway needs concerning the  County’s 
roadway system.  
 
The City continues to participate as a member of the Sarasota- Manatee MPO. The most recent  
LRTP Framework 20 40 from the Sarasota- Manatee MPO set a number of transportation  goals 
for the City:  
 
• Provide mobility on area roadways and enhance intermodal connectivity.  
• Strengthen the multimodal transportation system.  
• Coordinate land use and protect the environment. 
• Enhance system management and operations.  
• Ensure financial feasibility.  
• Involve public in transportation decision making.

Introduction  
 
The City of North Port Public Utilities Department manages the  potable water  and reclaimed  
water systems .  The City purchased the utility systems from the now defunct General 
Development Corporation (GDC)  through their subsidiary , General Development Utilities , in 
1992.  The City has and will continue to expan d and improve  the treatment and distribution 
systems .   
 While the backbone of the water system spans the boundaries of the Urban Service Area and 
most arterial and collector roads in between, m ost of the areas currently served by City of North 
Port utilities are located within or near the old City core area.  The City Utilities Department also 
serves areas outside of the City limits in unincorporated Sarasota County, including high -density 
mobile home parks.  Many residents/businesses outside of the core area currently utilize public 
and domestic  supply wells as their source for potable water.  The ground water source for these 
wells is the Intermediate Aquifer System .  The City of North Port’s ultimate goal is to expand the 
City’s potable w ater system to service areas of the City  within the City’s Urban Service Area 
Boundary.  The City of North Port Utilities Depar tment has developed and utilizes a  Utilities  Master 
Planning process  to formalize  the expansion of the utilities in a uniform manner.  Under the 
ownership of GDC , the utilities had been developed based on development needs and not as a 
water supplier. Construction of the utilities under this previous regime is evident and has taken  
time and planning to correct the resulting deficiencies  (e.g. dead -ends and undersized piping ). 
Utilities  Master Plans shall  be updated a minimum of once every five  (5) years  and include 
hydraulic modeling analyses . The Utilities Department shall also take part in the City’s annual 
capital improvement projects (CIP) programming process  in coordination with other City 
departments such as Public Works/Road & Drainage.  To help realize th e goal of expanded  water service, the City of North Port has and will continue 
to require all subdivisions/ developments to bear their share of the cost to e ngineer and construct 
the potable water  and reclaimed water systems  in applicable areas ; and, per the Sanitary 
Wastewater  Element, wastewater  systems .  This is done with the requirement that all developers 
will enter into a “Developer ’s Agreement” with the City of North Port . The developer will then 
bear the cost of engineering , permitting,  and constructing the needed systems for thei r 
developments.  For very large -scale developments , these agreement s may include  the 
engineering , permitting , and construction of a water treatment plant, which will then be 
dedicated to the City of North Port for its use and maintenance, thereby mitigating  the initial 
development cost to the City of North Port.   
 Potable Water  Element  
 4-3 Legislation  
 
Under Public Law 93- 523, the “Safe Drinking Water Act,” the federal government established 
water quality standards for the protection of water for public use, including operating standards and quality controls for public water supply systems.  This law directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to  establish minimum drinking water standards which are divided into 
“primary” standards, or those required for public health, and “secondary” standards, those recommended for aesthetic qualities , however as noted below, the secondary standards are also 
required by State of Florida regulations.   
 In accordance with federal requirements, the Florida Legislature adopted Chapter 403.850, Florida Statutes (F.S.),  the “Florida Safe Drinking Water Act.”  The Florida Department of 
Environmental Protection (FDEP) is  the state agency responsible for implementing this act and 
has established rules classifying and regulating public water systems under Chapter 62-550, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.) .  The primary and secondary standards of the “Safe 
Drinking Water A ct” are mandatory in the State of Florida.   
 The Sout hwest Florida Water Management D istrict (SWFWMD) has adopted rules under 
Chapter 40D, F.A.C., and is responsible for the management of water resources within a sixteen-county region to protect the suppl y necessary to meet existing and future water demands.  
Additional regulations relating to the operation of community, non -transient non-community, 
non-community , and limited use  public water supply systems are set forth within Chapter 62-
550, 555 (FDEP) and Chapter 64E- 8 (Florida Department of Health) . 
 Chapter 62- 251, F.A.C., provides criteria for : delineating wellhead protection areas; restrictions, 
including prohibition and regulation of certain substances, activities, and facilities in wellhead protect ion areas; and  establishes permitting requirements, compliance review inspections, and 
enforcement procedures.  The 2005 Legislature expanded the local government comprehensive plan requirements to strengthen coordination of water supply planning and local  land use planning.  This is 
accomplished through continued coordination with the SWFWMD Regional Water Supply Plan (RWSP) , which addresses the water supply facilities necessary to serve existing development , 
and new growth for which the City of North Port is responsible.  The City of North Port ’s Administrative Code 78-60 requires all residen ces and  business 
establishments to connect to the City of North Port potable water service within 365 days (one 
year) of the notification of service becoming available to the property.    Potable Water  Element  
 4-4 Relationship to 2005 Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR)  
 
The City’s Evaluation and Appraisal Report, which was adopted in 2005, did list two specific items, and one additional related item, pertaining to potable water in the list of major issues 
identified by the citizens of the City of North Port, City Staff, the Planning and Zoning Advisory Board, and the City Commission.  The first issue is that the City should be more aggressive in extending potabl e water and sanitary 
wastewater  service throughout the City.  The concern is the proliferation of wells and septic 
systems that have followed the growth of North Port , and the ultimate impact upon the 
environment and public health.  The City’s utilit ies master planning processes shall  be utilized to 
accomplish these goals, as will be indicated in the goals, objectives, and policies in this Comprehensive Plan.  The second major issue was to examine available water resources to support the growth 
projected fo r the City of North Port, to ultimate build -out, within the City’s Urban Service Area 
Boundary .  The City shall continue to use  the utilities  master planning processes to aid in 
identifying sources of potable water, including the City’s canal system as a s ource and ground 
water sources .  Coordination with the Southwest Florida W ater Management District (and 
consistency with the regional water supply plan) and other appropriate agencies shall continue.  A third major issue is related to the provision of, and protection of, a source of potable water – 
that is , the continuation of the Myakkahatchee Creek initiative.  As noted throughout this 
Comprehensive Plan, it is the City’s ultimate goal to assemble at least the first two tiers of property along each side of the creek north of U .S. 41 to create a linear park that would also 
serve to protect this valuable potable water resource and better maintain the function of the floodplain. 
 
Regulatory Compliance  
 
1.  Potable Water 
 
As noted above, the City is required to meet all standards as required by the Federal Safe 
Drinking Water Act and the FDEP by delegation.    As of 2013, the City has four (4) permitted potable water supply sources authorized by the SWFWMD to meet potable w ater demands through 2030:  Myakkahatchee Creek (ID No. 10), 
Cocoplum Canal (ID No. 11), the Myakkahatchee Creek RO wellfield (6 wells; ID Nos. VW -1 
through VW -6), and the West Villages RO wellfield (future 4 wells; ID Nos. 92 through 95).   
Additionally, the City has interconnects with the Peace River Manasota Regional Water Supply 
Authority (PRMRWSA); Sarasota County; and, Charlotte County.  A summary of the City’s permitted water supply sources is provided in the table below:

(1) The permit allows the City to offset surface water usage with up to 2,000,000 gpd of groundwater.  
(2) The combined surface and groundwater withdrawals are limited to 4,400,000 gpd (AADF) and 
6,000,000 gpd (PMF) regulated at the finished water meter (ID No. 20).  
(3) The total permitted capacity includes the West Villages RO Wellfield.  
 
The City of North Port w ithdraws raw surface water from the Myakkahatchee Creek  and 
Cocoplum Canal  for treatment through the surface water treatment system at the Myakkahatchee 
Creek Water Treatment Plant ( MCWTP under a SWFWMD consumptive water use permit 
(WUP #20002923.013). As noted in the table above, t his permit allows for the combined 
withdrawal of an annual average quantity of 4.4 million gallons per day (mgd) and a peak 
monthly quantity of 6.0 mgd, regulated at the MCWTP finished water meter (ID No. 20).   
 
The Myakkahatchee Creek RO wellfield is the raw groundwater source for the reverse osmosis (RO) treatment system at the MCWTP . The wellfield consists of six 12 -inch diameter wells 
constructed into the intermediate aquifer to a depth of 320 feet.  Five of the six wells are  located 
at 5650 North Port Blvd, North Port, Sarasota County Property Appraiser Parcel 0999002000, Section/Township/R ange: 32 -39S-21E . One of six wells is located at the MCWTP site, 5655 
North Port Blvd, North Port, Sarasota County Property Appraiser Parc el 0999002010, 
Section/Township/R ange: 32 -39S-21E. As noted in the table above, t his permit allows for the 
combined withdrawal of an annual average quantity of 4.4 mgd  and a peak monthly quantity of 
6.0 mgd, regulated at the MCWTP finished water meter (ID No. 20) . As noted above, Chapter 
62-251, F.A.C., provides criteria for : delineating wellhead protection areas; restrictions, 
including prohibition and regulation of certain substances, activities, and facilities in wellhead protection areas; and  establishes permitting requirements, compliance review inspections, and 
enforcement procedures.  The City’s Ordinance 2011- 05 provides for groundwater wellhead 
protection.  A West Villages RO wellfield for the planned Water Treatment Plant for the West Villages 
Impro vement District (WVID)  is located off of South River Road and  owned by Thomas Ranch 
Land Partners North Port LLLP. In the future these wells will be turned over to the City. As 
noted in the table above, the WUP  will allow  for the withdrawal of annual avera ge and peak 
monthly quantities of 2.0 mgd for this wellfield.    
 Potable Water  Element  
 4-6 The City will be examining  the feasibility and location of possible reservoir  site(s) to be used to 
supplement existing raw water sources.  Once determined, this Comprehensive Plan will be 
amended to include those sites. Reservoir(s) will be regulated by SWFWMD.   
 
 
2.  Regional Water Supply Coordination  
 Southwest Florida Water Management District  
The Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) is charged with the management, protection, and enhancement of water and water -related natural resources in the 
region in accordance with the Water Resources  Act (Chapter 373, Florida Statutes).  SWFWMD 
is als o responsible for developing a R egional Water Supply Plan, a requirement resulting from 
state laws that were adopted in 1997 which specifically amended Chapter 373, Florida Statutes  
(F.S.) .  The regional water supply planning requirements were again amended as a result of the 
passage of Senate Bill 444 during the 2005 legislative session in order to encourage better communication between water planners, city planners, and local utilities.  Included in this coordination and conservation is ongoing communication with the SWFWMD.  The Regional Water Supply Plan provides a framework for future water management decisions 
regarding the health of the hydrologic system and the system’s ability to meet long -term water 
resource demands.  SWFWMD’s Regional Water Supply Plan addresses a sixteen -county 
planning area along the west coast of Fl orida from Levy  to Charlotte County. 
 Under Florida law, local governments must address in their comprehensive plans the water supply sources necessary to meet and achieve existing and projected water use demand for the established planning period, considering the applicable regional water supply plan. Florida laws require local governments within areas projected to have insufficient supplies of water from traditional sources to amend their comprehensive plan: (1) to incorporate the alternative water supply project or projects selected by the local government from those identified in the regional 
water supply plan pursuant to s. 373.709(2)(a) or proposed by the local government under s. 373.709(8)(b); and (2) to adopt a work plan, covering at least a 10 -year planning period, for 
building public, private, and regional water supply facilities, including the development of alternative water supply projects, conservation , and reclaim ed water projects, which are 
necessary to serve existing and new development. Once adopted, the work plan must be updated within 18 months after the water management district updates the regional water supply plan, which typically occurs every five years.  
 The City of North Port lies within the Southern Water Use Caution Area (SWUCA).  The 
SWUCA was designated by SWFWMD in 1992 as an area impacted by increased groundwater withdrawal.  Potential impacts to the SWUCA include saltwater intrusion, reduced stream flow, 
and lowered lake levels.  The ultimate effect of the SWUCA on the City is that there will likely be pressure to seek alternative sources of potable water . 
 Potable Water  Element  
 4-7 3.  Reclaimed  Water 
 
The City of North Port’s reclaimed  water system is primarily regulated under FAC 62-610, 
Reuse of Reclaimed Water and Land Application , in addition to the City’s Waste water 
Treatment Plant (WWTP) FDEP operating permit, FLA01378, which requires renewal on a 5-year cycle .  The City of North Port’s system is managed in compliance with these regulations.  
Under the WWTP FDEP operating permit, the permitted capacity of the slow -rate public access 
system (R -001), consisting of the North Port Master Urban Reuse General Service Area, is 5.0 
MGD annual average daily flow (AADF).  The service area includes the incorporated limits of 
the City of North  Port.  
 
Conservation  
 
The City of North Port has take n great strides in its  water  conservation efforts.  The City has 
enacted rules for year-round water conservation tha t meet  SWFWMD  regulations .  The City 
Ordinance also requires consistency with SWFWMD regulations during declared  water shortage 
periods.  The City of North Port has enacted a regulation stating, “All landscaped areas shall be equipped with permanent irrigation systems. Where appropriate, it is strongly encouraged that drip irrigation be used. This provision shall not apply to existing plant or tree communities or to parcels for single -family and two -family dwellings.”  The City requires new construction under 
development order that all irrigation systems will be built to reclaim ed water standards. In 
addition to the regulation of irrigation, the City has many conservation programs to include an extensive public education program and enforces compliance of conservation rules by Code Enforcement.  The City also has an inverted six (6) tiered rate structure designed to encourage conservation.  The City has a 2008 Reuse Master Plan (Brown & Caldwell, April 28, 2008) and 
will continue to actively pursue other options for the conservation of water resources, such as promoting “Florida F riendly” landscaping , encouraging the utilization of low impact 
development principles in site design, and the use of drought tolerant plantings as outlined in this 
Comprehensive Plan.  Conservation efforts also include encouraging the use of reclaimed  water. Through the City’s 
sale of reclaimed  water , the City ’s customers  use less  irrigation well and  potable water for water 
intensive uses  such as irrigation of golf courses and landscaping . If feasible, properties where 
reclaim ed water is installed are welcome to connect to the system. The City shall continue to 
actively seek out new reclaimed  water  customers and , through Developer Agreements with the 
City,  require new development, when possible, to utilize reclaimed  water  and to construct 
irrigation systems to reclaimed water standards . 
 
Inventory 
 As of 2013, t he City’s potable water system  has twelve  primary components  as follows: 
1. The Myakkahatchee Creek raw surface water supply.  
2. The Cocoplum Waterway raw surface water supply. 
3. The Myakkahatchee Creek RO wellfield groundwater supply. 
4. Peace River/Manasota Regional  Water Supply Authority Interconnect s, a regional 
finished water supply. Potable Water  Element  
 4-8 5. The West Villages RO wellfield groundwater supply. 
6. Interconnect s with Sarasota and Charlotte Counties  for backup/emergencies. 
7. Myakkahatchee Creek Water Treatment Plant  (MCWTP) with 3.5 MG  storage facilities . 
8. The Hillsborough Booster Pump Station. 
9. The Northeast Booster Pump Station with a 3.0 MG  storage facility.  
10. The Southwest Booster Pump Station  with a 1.0 MG  storage facility . 
11. The transmission and distribution piping system. 
12. An Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) well is  being evaluated for its potential as a 
means for storing minimally treated surface water during the summer rainy season f or 
later treatment and use during the winter dry season. 
The first four items noted above are the primary sources for the City ’s potable water supply . The 
fifth item above is for future supply.   The City is permitted by SWFWMD  to withdraw surface 
water from both the Myakkahatchee Creek and the Cocoplum Waterway, both of which run 
through the City.  The City is also permitted to withdraw brackish groundwater from the intermediate aquifer using the six wells (i.e. Myakkahatchee C reek RO wellfield). Water from 
these surface water and groundwater sources is treated at the MCWTP  prior to distribution.  The 
City also receives and distributes finished potable water from the Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority (PR/MRWSA) through existing agreement s. The City receives 
and supplies potable water from/to Sarasota County through an existing agreement.  The City also supplies potable water to Charlotte County through an existing bulk purchase agreement. Additional interconnects with Charlotte County are for emergency purposes.   As of 2013, t he City ’s reclaimed  water system  has two  primary components as follows: 
1. Treatment, storage, and pumping facilities at the City of North Port WWTP.  
2. Reclaimed  water distribution system.  
  
Analysis of Potable Water Needs  
1.  Demand and Flow Projections  
 The City’s Utilities shall prepare and evaluate demand and flow projections  as part of the 
recurring five year utilities master plan ning updates.   
 2. Utility Expansion into Existing Neighborhoods  
 Please refer  to the Madagascar Neighborhood Plan dated January 2007; and, the 2014 Water 
Demand Analysis.

 Potable Water  Element  
 4-9 Developer Contributions  
 
In order for the City to realize its goal of expanding potable water service within the City’s 
Urban Service Area Boundary , it must rely on the contributions of developers to help defray the 
costs of the needed infrastructure.  This may come in the form of upgrades to existing facilities, construction of new facilities, reimbursements to the City for improvements made by the City or another form of contribution.  The City requires all developers to enter into a D eveloper ’s 
Agreement in order for the City to ascertain the needs that the development will require from the 
potable water system and, if applicable, the reclaimed  water system, and how those needs will be 
met by both the City and the developer.  The City of North Port require s the developer to supply 
the City with hydraulic modeling detailing the development ’s impacts to the existing 
infrastructure.  The City may  require developers to investigate possible potable water sources 
which may be available on their property in order to serve both the development and as a possible future source of potable water for the City .  As stated in the GOP’s the City will not 
allow devel opment to go forward (except currently vested quarter -acre lots) if the water 
resources are not available to handle the demand of the developments.  
Future Needs  
1.  Potable Water Supply , Treatment , and Distribution Facilities  
Future needs of the water supply, treatment , and distribution  facilities are to be determined as 
part of the recurring five-year master plan updates and other studies/analyses as needed.   
Future water supply and treatment facility needs  will be significantly  influenced by the reliability 
of existing sources of water supply and by customer growth in the the WVID  and Panacea  
developments.    
Other Transmission Improvements  
The hydraulic model for the City’s water distribution system shall  be calibrated and updated as 
needed .  The City shall  also include a water quality component in the distribution model  
analyses . Recommendations  of modeling analyses  shall guide transmission improvements.  
 Potable Water Conclusion 
The City shall  continue to pursue both new groundwater and surface water  sources in order to 
augment the current water supplies.  The City is also committed to extending potable water 
service to the existing platted lots  within the City’s Urban Service Area Boundary .  The City will 
continue to require new developments to pay for their own improvements to the infrastructure due to their developments, while also requiring contributions so that the City will be able to upgrade its facilities City -wide.  
 
2.  Future Development of the Reclaimed  Water System 
The 2008 Reuse Master Plan  (Brown & Caldwell, April 28, 2008) , set forth the plan for 
expanding the reclaimed  water system throughout build-out. The City’s Utilities Department 
shall continue to evaluate and update the plan as needed; and, implement the plan.  
 Future expansion of the City ’s reclaimed  water system is likely to yield several benefits.  First, 
this will support the City ’s goal of minimizing the use of potable water for irrigation, thus 
conserving natural water resources and helping to maintain the re latively low per -capita potable Potable Water  Element  
 4-10 water consumption rate that has historically existed in the City.   The City’s goal of expanding the 
potable water distribution system will be more easily reached  by maximizing the use of 
reclaimed  water.  Also, distributing more reclaimed  water will minimize the volume of treated 
wastewater to be disposed of through other means, thus further benefiting the environment and 
reducing the need for permitting and developing future effluent disposal facilities.  In conclusion, the City will continue to explore all possible options to increase the use of reclaimed  water for purposes of irrigation.  Through the use of the  proposed W WTPs in the 
WVID and Panacea areas in co njunction with the current City  WWTP, the City will strive to 
increase the number of customers of  reclaimed  water in order to reduce the use of potable water 
for irrigation of developments. Sanitary Sewer  Element

 4-12 SANITARY SEWER ELEMENT  
 
Introduction  
 
The City of North Port Public Utilities Department currently provides wastewater utility service 
to approximately 14,500 sanitary sewer  connections.  The City purchased the utility systems 
from the now defunct General Development Corporation through their subsidiary, General 
Development Utilities in 1992.  The City has completed several system expansion and 
improvement projects since that time in an effort to better serve the customers of the City of North Port.  The City of North Port has been experiencing rapid growth in recent years, and the 
City’s Plann ing and Zoning Department projects that the City’s population will grow to 
approximately 124,000 people by the year 2040 .  This growth will be spurred by the proposed 
large scale dev elopments in the former Taylor R anch, then Thomas Ranch, now West Villages  
Improvement District (WVID) , in the western part of the City and by the Panacea area in the 
northeastern part of the City, while the older platted lots of the City are continuing to be 
developed. 
 
Most of the areas currently served by City of North Port utilities are located within or near the 
old City core area.  Many residents/businesses outside of this core currently utilize private septic 
systems for wastewa ter disposal.  The City  of North Port’s  ultimate goal is to expand the 
wastewater system to service areas of t he City south of Interstate 75 and several areas that are 
part of existing Activity Centers or Villages to the north of the highway, but  not including the 
Agricultural/E states section.  
Per the 1997 City of North Port Comprehensive Plan, the C ity of North Port Utilities Department 
has developed, and accepted, a ut ility master plans to formalize the expansion of the utilities in a 
uniform manner and not the haphazard way in which it was done previously.  This Master Plan is 
updated a minimum of once every five  (5) years  (most recently in 2015) , and  may be amended to 
include other criteria, such as the ability to put in water and sewer infrastructure along with other City infrastructure such as roadways and sidewalks.  
 To help realize this goal of  overall city-wide wastewater service, the City is requiring all large 
scale developments to bear their share of the cost to engineer and construct the wastewater systems.  This is done with the requirement that all developers will enter into a “Developer ’s 
Agreement” with the City of North Port. T he developer will then bear the cost of engineering 
and developing the needed systems for their developments.  For very large scale developments, 
such as WVID , these  agreement s may include  the design, permitting, and construction of a 
wastewater  plant, a reuse storage and distribution system  which will then be dedicated to the City 
of North Port for its use and maintenance, thereby eliminating the initial development cost to the 
City of North Port.   
 
Legislation  
 
Any entity processing more than 2,000 gallons of sewage per day must treat wastewater through 
a centralized wastewater treatment system.  The following are the relevant laws which govern 
wastewater treatment, including a brief description of each.  Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-13  
U.S. Pu blic Law 92-500, “ Federal Water Pollution Control Act,” relates to the provision of 
sanitary sewer service with the goal of restoring or maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters.  In the first years after the 1972  passage of this act, 
area wide wastewater treatment and management plans were developed to ensure adequate control of source polluters.  
 Section 201 grants were available to local governments for the construction of facilities that were  
“point sources” of  pollution including sewage treatment facilities.  
 
Sections 403.085 and 403.086, Florida Statutes, “Sewage Disposal Facilities: Advanced and 
Secondary Waste Treatment,” as amended, in part, and chapters 62 -4, “Permitting,” and 62-200 
“Wastewater Facilities ,” Florida Administrative Code, implement Public Law 92 -500 at the State 
level.  Chapters 62 -4, 62- 600, 62- 601, 62- 604, 62- 610, 62- 620, and 62- 640, Florida 
Administrative Code, as amended, provide for the rules regarding the permitting, construction and operation of wastewater treatment facilities, including regulations establishing minimum 
water quality standards for the discharge of effluent and residuals from domestic wastewater 
facilities.  Chapter 62 -600, Florida Administrative Code, regulates industri al wastewater 
facilities and establishes minimum water quality standards for the discharge of the treated wastewater into the environment or into a domestic wastewater collection system.  
 Sections 403.085 and 403.086, Florida Statutes, establish requirements for the treatment and 
reuse or disposal of domestic wastewater.  Prior to October 1, 1990, Section 403.086, Florida 
Statutes, required wastewater effluent to be treated to a minimum of secondary treatment, and to 
the extent necessary, required disinfection and pH control, as defined respectively in Sections 
62-600.440, and 62- 600.445, Florida Administrative Code, prior to discharge into holding ponds , 
disposal systems, or surface waters.  A 1987 amendment to Section 403.086, Florida Statutes, the Grizzle Figg bill, mandated advanced waste treatment (AWT) by October 1, 1990 for wastewater 
treatment plants which employ surface water discharge.  Surface waters included Sarasota Bay, Little Sarasota Bay, Roberts Bay, Lemon Bay, Charlotte Harbor, and any river , stream, channel, 
canal, bay, bayou, sound, or other water tributary thereto.   
 
In 1994, the Florida Legislature enacted the “Florida APRICOT (A Prototype Realistically 
Innovative Community of Today) Act,” which amended S ections 403.086 and 403.859, Flor ida 
Statutes, regarding the reuse of wastewater effluent.  The legislation allows for backup discharges to surface waters not exceeding 30 percent of the permitted capacity during periods of 
reduced demand for reclaimed water when certain conditions are met.  
 Chapters 62- 4 and 62- 620 set forth procedures on how to obtain a permit from the State of 
Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and provide requirements and procedures for the issuance, denial, renewal, extension, transfer, modification, suspension, and 
revocation of any permit required by the FDEP.  Chapters 62- 600 and 62- 610 provide minimum 
standards for the design of domestic wastewater facilities and establish minimum treatment and disinfection requirements for the operation of domes tic wastewater facilities.  Chapter 62 -601 
ensures that owners and operators of domestic wastewater treatment facilities maintain accurate records and submit reports in a timely, accurate, and uniform manner.  Chapters 62- 602 and 62-Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-14 699 provide for Operator Certification to assure that qualified and certified operations personnel 
operate wastewater treatment plants.  
 Chapter 62- 604, Florida Administrative Code, provides minimum design, operation, and 
maintenance standards for domestic wastewater collection/ transmission systems.  The FDEP 
requires a general permit for the construction of wastewater collection and transmission 
facilities.  The general permit is essentially a 30 -day notice of construction, which is granted 
automatically.  The FDEP also requires  a specific “dryline” permit for the construction of 
proposed expansions to the collection or transmission system when wastewater treatment 
facilities lack an operating permit (expired permit) or are significantly non -compliant (no 
available capacity and o ther violations).  Sarasota County Water Resources conducts the FDEP 
plan reviews for collection and transmission facilities and reviews and issues wastewater 
treatment plant permits.    
 Chapter 62- 610, Florida Administrative Code, provides for the regulation of both the disposal 
and reuse of reclaimed water (treated effluent).  Disposal can include deep well injection and off -
site discharge to surface waters.  The rule also contains specific reuse and land application 
requirements.  Reuse generally includes the use of percolation ponds and spray irrigation.  The 
City of North Port is continuing to examine other reuse alternatives including methods which 
could augment potable water supplies.  The regulations require the operators of wastewater 
treatment plan ts to submit monthly discharge monitoring reports.   The reports include 
information concerning effluent quality (for example, total suspended solids, bio- chemical 
oxygen demand, fecal coliform, and nitrates) and daily operating data (such as flow, chlorine  
residual, pH, and staffing time).  
 
The FDEP also has regulations regarding sanitary sewer facilities that are near capacity.  Section 
62-600.405 of the Florida Administrative Code, “Planning for Wastewater Facilities Expansion,” 
requires permittees of facilities to monitor and compare actual flows with the permitted capacities, to submit capacity analysis reports on a scheduled basis and to provide for timely 
planning, design, and construction of wastewater facilities, as necessary, in accordance with the 
stated schedule in the rule.  This rule was adopted in January 1991 and it is significant in that it 
greatly increased the accountability required of permittees of facilities with respect to monitoring 
the facilities’ capacity status.  
 The City of North Port has enacted Ordinance No. 03-14, which requires all residents, business 
establishments included, if they are currently on private septic systems  to hook into the City of 
North Port sanitary sewer system  within 365 days (one year)  notice of the service b ecoming 
available to the neighborhood.   
 
Relationship to Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR)  
 
The City’s Evaluation and Appraisal Report, which was adopted in 2005, did list one specific 
item, and one related item, relating to sanitary sewer service in the list of major issues identified 
by the citizens of the City of North Port, City Staff, the Planning and Zoning Advisory Board, and the City Commission.  
 Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-15 The first issue is that the City should be more aggressive in extending potable water and sanitary 
sewer service throughout the City.  The concern is the proliferation of wells and septic systems 
that have followed the growth of this platted lands community, and the ir ultimate impact upon 
the environment and public health.  The City’s utility master planning processes will be utilized to accomplish these goals, as will be indicated in the revised goals, objectives, and policies in 
this Comprehensive Plan.  
 A second  major issue is certainly related to the provision of, and protection of, a source of 
potable water – that is the continuation of the Myakkahatchee Creek initiative.  As noted 
throughout this Comprehensive Plan, it is the City’s ultimate goal to assemble at least the first 
two tiers of property along each side of the creek north of U .S. 41 to cr eate a linear park that 
would also serve to protect this valuable potable water resource and better maintain the function of the floodplain.  This is especially important when pertaining to sewer service, as the specter of 
hundreds, if not thousands, of ol der septic tanks failing along the Myakkahatchee Creek is 
something the City must strive to keep from happening.   
 
Utilities Master Plan ning  
 The 1997 Comprehensive Plan for the City of North Port mandated the development and 
acceptance of a Utility Master Plan to guide the expansion of the utility system .  The City of 
North Port developed  master planning tools  that provided guidance for the expansion of the 
utility system as well as directed a capital improvement plan based on anticipated flows and 
antici pated population projections.  The platted nature of the City of North Port necessitated such 
a guide.    
One component of the Utility Master Plan was to  formaliz e guidelines and rankings to direct the 
provision of service into neighborhoods as they begin to build- out.  In addition to the Utility 
Master Plan, in 2006 the City began the wastewater master program which included master 
planning for the sanitary sewer system  and design and expansion of the existing Central 
Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP ). Wi th the 2012 passage of the City’s Urban Services 
Boundary that limits the development of sewer and water services to areas generally south of 
Interstate  75 and west of the Bethlehem Waterway, future improvements to the City’s utilities 
can be made in an orderly manner.  
 This Comprehensive Plan includes policy language requiring an assessment of overall 
neighborhood initiatives as another parameter for consideration when extending utility service to existing neighborhoods.   
 
Regulatory Compliance  
 
The City currently treats all of the wastewater flow at its  CWWTP  under a FDEP domest ic 
wastewater facility permit.  This permit allows the City to operate a Type I activated sludge 
domestic wastewater treatment plant which disposes treated effluent through a reclaimed water 
system and deep injection well.  Table 4-5 below summarizes the primary treatment requirements 
indicated in the permit.

The City of North Port’s reuse water system is primarily regulated under F .A.C. 62-610, Reuse 
of Reclaimed Water and Land Application .  The City of North Port’s sy stem is currently in 
compliance with these regulations.  
 In addition to remaining in compliance with the domestic wastewater facility operating permit, 
the City must also operate a deep injection well system under a FDEP Class I municipal injection 
well sy stem permit.  This permit sets forth operating, testing, and reporting requirements for the 
deep injection well system.  The permit states that “the injection well shall be continuously monitored and controlled at all times to ensure that the maximum susta ined pressure at the 
wellhead does not exceed 84 psi on the final casing and a maximum peak flow of 5.32  million 
gallons per day (3, 700 gpm).”   
 
Inventory  
 
The City of North Port’s existing wastewater system serves a significantly smaller service area 
than the City’s potable water system.  City sewer service is available primarily in the City core 
area, and in some new developments located along Toledo Blade and Sumter Boulevard.  All 
wastewater collected in the City’s sewer system is delivered to the City  Central Wastewater 
Treatment Plant ( CWWTP).  The treated wastewater is disposed of through the City’s reclaimed 
water system and a deep injection well.  
  Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-17 The primary components of the City’s wastewater system are described in detail below:  
 
• Wastewater col lection and transmission system.  
• City of North Port Central Wastewater Treatment Plant ( CWWTP).  
• Deep Injection Well (DIW).  
• Public Access Reclaimed Water System.  
 
A.  Collection and Transmission Facilities  
The City’s wastewater collection and transmission s ystem consists of approximately 137 
miles of sewer lines and over 100 sewage lift stations.  The collection system is a 
conventional gravity system which transports wastewater flows by gravity from the 
customers’ connection points to one of the City’s lift  stations.  The lift stations collect 
wastewater flows and pump it through force  mains to another gravity collection system, a 
primary lift station, or directly to the treatment plant.  The City’s wastewater transmission 
system consists of 4 to 24- inch for cemains.  
 B.  City of North Port Central Wastewater Treatment Plant  
The City of North Port C WWTP is located on the west side of Pan American Boulevard just 
north of US -41.  The CWWTP is operated under a FDEP domestic wastewater facility 
permit.  In 2007, t he City and FDEP re -rated the CWWTP from 3.7 mgd to 4.4 mgd  three-
month average daily flow (3MADF) .  Based on typical engineering planning guidelines, the  
7.0 mgd (ADF)  permitted treatment capacity at the City’s C WWTP correlates to a maximum 
three-month average daily flow of 4.4 7.0 mgd 3MADF .  The design capacity of the plant is 
summarized as follows: 
 
• Annual Average Daily Flow (ADF) = 3.52  mgd.  
• Three Month Average Daily Flow (3MADF) = 7.0 mgd. 
• Maximum Month Average Daily Flow (MMADF) = 5.9 mgd.  
• Maximum Daily Flow (MDF) = 7.75 mgd. 
• Maximum Hourly Flow (MHF) = 10.14 mgd.  
 
Average daily flows curren tly range from approximately 1.5  to 2.0 mgd throughout the year, 
and the peak wet weather flows can approach 4.173 mgd MDF .  A portion of the plant 
effluent is distributed in the City’s reclaimed water distribution system, and the rest is disposed of through a deep injection well located off site.  
 The plant is classified as an extended aeration activated sludge facility with screening, grit 
removal, fine bubble aeration, and secondary clarification.  Effluent to be distributed as 
reclaimed water undergoes additional treatment processes including filtration and high level 
disinfection. 
 
The City’s wastewater biosolids processing operations have recently changed.  The  City 
currently aerates the biosolids in the holding tank (with no lime stabilization) and contracts with a company that brings in a mobile centrifuge unit and dewaters the sludge.  The 
dewatered cake (approximately 20% solids) is hauled by the contractor to the Oke echobee 
landfill, and the remaining water is returned to the plant.  Previously, the wastewater Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-18 biosolids were stabilized through the addition of lime in aerobic digestion tanks.  The 
stabilized Class B biosolids were then removed from the plant in liquid form by a contract 
hauler , who disposed of it by land application.  The wastewater treatment plant still has the 
facilities required to treat biosolids to Class B standards.  
 
C.  Deep Injection Well  
Effluent from the City’s C WWTP that is not distributed in the reclaimed water system is 
pumped approximately 3 miles through a 16- inch pipeline and disposed of through a deep 
injection well (DIW) located southwest of the City core area just west of the North Port – Charlotte County border and east of the Myakka River.  This Class I deep injection well is 
regulated by the FDEP through a Class I municipal injection well system permit and the 
Underground Injection Control Department under Florida Administrative Code Rules 62-4, 
62-250, 62- 522, 62- 528, 62-600, and 62- 610.  The DIW has been in operation for 
approximately 20 years and is currently permitted for a maximum injection rate of 5.32 mgd, at a maximum pressure of 133 psi at the well head.  The DIW system also includes two (2) 
groundwater monitoring wells.  The DIW is approximately 3,200 feet deep with 1,105 feet of 14-inch diameter casing.

Analysis of Sanitary Sewer Needs Thru  2025  
 
A.  Demand and Flow Projections  
As a basis for system planning in the utility master plans projections of future wastewater flows 
were developed based on historical population, projected population, historical water use rates, 
and projected water use rates based on a changing City demography.   
 
When the  2005 Utility Master Plan , (Black & Veatch, June 13, 2005)  was a ccepted, the US 
Census Bureau Year 2000 Census data was used as the base, with a population of 22,797 persons.   The population of the study area (which includes the Old Myakka Uti lities service area) 
derived from a summation of the Year 2000 Census Blocks was 27,876 persons.  The Year 2000 Census for the study area also shows the number of occupied housing units.   
 B.  Projected Future Wastewater Usage Rates and Peaking Factors  
Based on typical planning guidelines  and recent CWWTP re- rated capacity , the projected 
average day dry -weather average daily flow  (ADF) was calculated to be 3.52 mgd.  Due to the 
occurrence of inflow and infiltration (I&I) of rainwater into wastewater collection systems 
during storm events, and based on typical engineering planning guidelines , the peaking factor of 
wastewater that enters the C WWTP is calculated at 2.6.   This peaking factor was used to project 
future peak day flows for the City throughout the planning period.   
The planning database  was supplied by the City Utility Department to determine the  projected 
wastewater flows for planning years 2008, 2013 , 2018, and, 2030.  The resulting projections are 
summarized in Table 4-6:

Utility Expansion into Existing Neighborhoods  
 
1.  Introduction  
The City of North Port will also be expanding the sanitary sewer  system to existing 
neighborhoods.  Within the City, there are currently 60 designated neighborhoods ranging in size 
from approximately 20 acres to over 3,600 acres.  The  City currently provides sanitary sewer  
service to a portion of these neighborhoods.  The neighborhoods that currently have sanitary sewer  service are located primarily in the older City core area where the General Development 
Corporation first developed and built.  The platted nature of North Port meant that the neighborhoods beyond the “core” developed in a haphazard fashion over time.  However, in the 
past decade tremendous growth has caused neighborhoods to fill, and make it more amenable 
and cost -effective to extend water and sewer infrastructure.  
 The goal of the City is to eventually connect all residences within the City limits to the City’s 
utility system (with the exception of the North Port Estates and Lake Geraldine areas, as these 
areas are intended to be agricultural/estates).  In general, these centralized utility systems are considered to offer increased environmental, health, and safety benefits over private wells 
because the centralized systems can be more closely monitored and controlled.  In keeping with 
this goal, the City has implemented policies that require all newly developed neighborhoods to be constructed with infrastructure to connect into the City’s water systems . Again, this is for 
subdivided portions of larger tracts of land and does not apply to the old quarter acre platted lots.  
 
 The City will be completing a Neighborhood Improvements Master Plan in the near future  to 
evaluate the areas not currently provided with utility service. This master plan will be used to prioritize the neighborhoods and the order of improvements including their financial feasibility.  
The City has policies in place in this Comprehensive Plan requiring residences of existing neighborhoods (the platted lots) to connect to the City of North Port utility  system within one (1) 
year after the appropriate infrastructure is made available to the residences that currently lack the services.  Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-20 Developer Contributions  
 
In order for the City of North Port to realize its ultimate goal of City -wide sanitary sewer  service, 
it must rely on the contributions of developers to help defray the costs of the needed infrastructure.  This may come in the form of upgrades to existing facilities, construction of new 
facilities, reimbursements to the City for improvements made by the City or another form of 
contribution.  The City requires all developers to enter into a Developer ’s Agreement in order for 
the City to ascertain the needs that the development will require from the wastewater  system and 
how those needs will be met by both the City and the developer.  The City of North Port requires 
the developer to supply the City with hydraulic modeling detailing the development ’s impacts to 
the existing infrastructure.  The City of North Port will require the developer to supply hydra ulic 
modeling detailing the developments ’ impacts to the existing infrastructure.  The City may  
requir e developers to investigate possible wastewater facilities  which may be located  on their 
property in order to serve both the development and  for the City,  specifically in the WVID  and 
Kelce Ranch areas.  
 
Future Needs  
 A.  Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Facilities  
The City will be expanding capacity of the C WWTP to 7.0 mgd (3MADF) by 2010.  The 
expansion includes components relating to the provision of  reuse water .  Additional capacity of  
approximately 6.3 mgd ADF  is projected to be needed by 2025.  At build -out, it is projected that 
the City of North Port’s wastewater system will need to have a total wastewater treatment 
capacity of at least 23.5 mgd ADF .  These dates are preliminary and subject to change due to the 
current economic downturn and slowdown of growth.  The City will amend the CIP when these projects are scheduled into the five -year plan and will be financially feasible per Florida Statute . 
 As with potable water , future wastewater flows will be significantly influenced by customer 
growth in the large proposed new developments of WVID , Kelce Ranch, and the Panacea DRI.  
The projected flow reflects the development schedule presented to the City by the developers, 
which the City has committed to meet.  However, due to  the current economic climate plaguing 
the State, current progress suggests that actual development of these areas may lag behind the developers’ proposed schedule.  Therefore, the short term expansion needs may be reduced if the 
current schedule trends persist.  The City will monitor this closely and adjust the schedule for 
utility system improvements as necessary.  
 
Options for increasing the system’s wastewater treatment capacity  to meet the projected increase 
in flows anticipated within the planning period include expansion of the City’s existing WWTP and the construction of new WWTPs.  Proposed locations of new WWTPs include sites in the 
WVID  and Panacea development areas.  Recommendations between available wastewater 
treatment capacity alternatives are made below in consideration of several criteria including:  
• The time required for development.  
• Geographic location of flows and associated cost and operational benefits.  
• Known technical and regulatory feasibility.  
• Known relative cost differences.  Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-21 The wastewater treatment options discussed below are those considered to be the preferred 
options in consideration of the above criteria as well as the preferences of City Staff as 
determin ed through workshops, meetings, and discussions.  
 The set of wastewater treatment implementations recommended herein represent one potential 
solution, and it should be noted that the City may need to adjust the set of implementations and 
quantities depending on future events and the dynamic changing of the City of North Port.  
 
 1.  Expansion of existing C WWTP.  
Expanding the treatment capacity of the City’s existing C WWTP represents the fastest 
way to increase the City’s wastewater treatment capacity.  As no ted above, and in the 
CIP, the City will be expanding capacity of the C WWTP to 7.0 mgd by 2010.  The 
expansion includes components relating to the provision of re use water .   
 
 2.  New Wastewater Treatment Facilities  
The City purchased  a piece of land on the Panacea DRI property to use for siting future 
utility system facilities, including a proposed new NE WWTP.  The developer for the 
WVID (Thomas Ranch)  area has also agreed to dedicate a portion of their property for 
future siting of utility system facilities.  Utilizing these sites for future WWTPs will place 
the treatment plants geographically close to areas of projected substantial growth in North 
Port, thus minimizing future pumping costs and minimizing the cost of new infrastructure 
to convey flows to the plant.  In addition, hydraulic modeling performed as part of the 
utility master planning indicates that the resulting dispersed location of WWTPs 
significantly reduce the need to upgrade wastewater transmission piping and pumping facilities into the  CWWTP as  flows increase.  Locating these plants in the vicinity of the 
proposed WVID  and Panacea/ Kelce Ranch developments also facilitates the supply of 
reuse water to those communities for non- potable irrigation.  
 The City has designed and permitted the construction of a second DIW that will be 
located on the same site as the existing DIW.  The DIW has an approximate capacity of 
13 mgd.  It is anticipated that construction of this DIW will begin in 2008. Additional 
deep injection wells are likely to occur  in the Kelce and WVID (Thomas Ranch)  
developments.   
 
For the purpose of planning, the f ollowing WWTP projects are proposed for 
implementation prior to 2025:  
 
• Southwest WWTP – Phase I:  
This WWTP is projected to be needed by 2010, with an initial average daily flow treatment capacity of 3.0 mgd.   
 
• Northeast  WWTP – Phase I:  
This WWTP is projected to be needed by 2015, with an initial average daily flow 
treatment capacity of 2.0 mgd.   Following development of this WWTP , all of the 
flow in the Panacea DRI dev elopment will be transferred to this WWTP.   
 Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-22 • Southwest WWTP – Phase II (Expansion):  
This expansion is projected to be needed by 201 8, and is envisioned to increase 
the average daily flow treatment capacity from 3.0 mgd to 6.0 mgd.  
 
• Northeast  WWTP – Phase II (Expansion):  
This expansion is projected to be needed by 2021 and is envisioned to increase the 
average daily flow treatment capacity from 2.0 mgd to 5 .0 mgd.

As stated previously, these dates, and /or capacities, may be changed due to fluctuating market 
conditions or changes in the City of North Port.  
 
3.  Regional Wastewater Treatment Capacity  
Neighboring utilities have expressed an interest in purchasing WWTP capacity from the 
City at both the proposed SWWWTP and the NE WWTP.  The City will look at 
implementing these proposed WWTP’s with a greater capacity than that recommended by the utility master plans to accommodate additional regional flow.  Due to economy of 
scale, economic benefits could potential ly result from such an agreement.  Although no 
agreements have been made, the City will entertain potential regional wastewater 
customers including Sarasota County, Desoto County, Charlotte County, and Englewood.  
 
4.  Wastewater Treatment Capacity Expansio n Beyond 2030 
As indicated previously, the build- out average daily wastewater flow for North Port is 
projected to be approximately 23.5 mgd.  The recommended improvements through 2030 
discussed above would provide the City with a total of approximately 16 mgd of average 
daily treatment capacity.  In order to handle long -term future flows, implementation of 
additional wastewater treatment/disposal capacity is projected to be needed in the amount 
of approximately 7.0 mgd average day after 2030 .  To achieve th is, the City may consider 
future expansion of the proposed Southwest and/or the Northeast  WWTPs.  
Implementation of a new WWTP and disposal facilities in another location within the 
North Port City limits is also a possibility.  The City will consider oppo rtunities for future 
property acquisitions to accommodate the siting of a potential long- term wastewater 
treatment facility.  
  
 Sanitary Sewer  Element  
 4-23 B.  Collection and Transmission Facilities  
The utility master planning process will require  hydraulic modeling of the projected wastewater 
system .  Necessary pumping and piping improvements will address the following needs:  
 
• Expand the system to extend wastewater service to areas/residences which 
currently do not have service, including both existing neighborhoods and new 
developme nts. 
• Provide piping to convey flows to new WWTPs.  
• Add or upgrade pumps and pipes to accommodate higher system flow rates 
anticipated in the future.  
The City will also address improvements to lower the amount of inflow and infiltration (I&I) experienced by the system, which would reduce the need to upgrade lift stations or piping in the 
future.   
 The following utility components  will be needed to address the previous needs:  
 
1.  Lift Stations  
In order to pump initial wastewater flows from the developments/r esidences to the 
existing and proposed WWTPs.  These lift stations are used to convey the wastewater 
flows through the gravity feed transmission system.  These lift stations will be located at 
strategic locations throughout the City of North Port, the spec ific locations will be 
determined through detailed analysis for the larger developments, and throughout the neighborhoods slated for expansion.  
  2.  Force main and w astewater collection piping  
This piping will be needed to convey wastewater flows from the  proposed developments 
and residences through the lift stations and to the existing and proposed WWTPs.  The 
sizes and locations of this piping will be determined through hydraulic modeling based 
on the proposed uses and densities of the developments.   
 
Conclusion  
 
In conclusion, the City of North Port  is committed to providing its citizens with sanitary sewer 
service to all areas except the Agricultural/Estates.  The City will continue its expansion into existing neighborhoods while requiring developers of large tracts of land to develop and 
implement their own infrastructure to both serve their developments and to help defray the costs 
to the City as a whole.  The environmental advantages to City- wide sanitary sewer is the 
decrease, and eventual elimination of septic systems which can create environmental hazards upon failing in all areas of the City (with the except ion of  the Agricultural/Estates as noted 
above) .   Solid Waste  Element

Introduction 
 
The City of North Port Solid Waste Division , which is part of the Public Works Department, is 
responsible for providing residential and commercial solid waste collection.  City oversight began in 1960 when the then City of North Port Charlott e issued a franchise for the collection of garbage 
within the city limits.   The City of North Port then took over collection in the mid 1970’s  and in 
1989 created a Solid Waste District .   
 In the early days, solid waste disposal  was handled by the City  of North Port .  The City leased land 
from General Development Corporation to permit and operate a landfill.  The landfill was located southwest of S umter  Blvd. and Price Blvd.  Landfill operation ceased in 1984 and a transfer station, 
also permitted and oper ated by the City, was utilized at this site until the late 1980’s.  The garbage  
was then taken directly to Sarasota County’s Jackson Road Transfer S tation. A closure permit for 
the landfill was issued by the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation in 1990.  When 
the County opened the Central County Solid Waste Disposal Complex in 1998, garbage was no 
longer accepted at the Jackson Road Transfer Station but taken directly to the new facility  located 
on Knights Trail Road in Nokomis.  The City of North Port implemented automated garbage collection in 2000 and enhanced it with the efficient one side of the street garbage collection in 2009.  Yard waste diversion was made mandatory in 1994 followed by mandatory recycling in 2008.     
Waste Reduction & Recycling  
 
The natural beauty of North Port and the surrounding area is something to be preserved.  To help 
in this effort, the Solid Waste Division promotes waste reduction, reuse and recycling along with the proper management of garbage through community outreach.  Emphasis is placed first on not 
producing waste, second on reusing items, and third on recycling materials before deeming something a waste.  Outreach activities include giving away reusable shopping bags made from 
plastic bottles, comp osting promotions and showing how to re- purpose waste materials.  
 In addition to activities, the City provides a Guide to Solid Waste Services  brochure and 
information on its website.  The website offers users general information about waste reduction, recycling, and new programs and services and is updated regularly to provide current information about waste reduction events.    Participation in community events, school and organization visits and media programs are some public outreach tools Solid Waste uses to promote waste reduction and recycling.  In addition, Solid Waste works with the Property Standards division on illegal dumping and code  compliance  
issues.  These educational activities help reinforce how the community can work to protect its  
natural resources.  
   Solid Waste  Element  
 4-26 Collection  
 
Ensuring the safety and health of North Port  citizens through the proper and efficient collection 
and disposal of solid waste is the Division’s mission and is accomplished through the weekly collection  of garbage, recycling and yard waste plus special bulk collection  as scheduled. Each 
residence is provided a 95- gallon automated garbage container for household garbage with 
additional garbage containers  (AGC’s) offered for a fee.  Automated garbage trucks collect  the 
AGC’s  every week on specified route days.  For larger items, each residence is offered two free 
bulk pick-ups per year , each limited to 5 cubic yards.  These collections are scheduled and the 
material is handled according to type of waste.  Appliances  are recycled and general garbage 
landfilled.   Residential curbside  weekly recycling and yard waste collection also occurs on the same day as 
garbage collection.  Recycling bins are furnished to residences who sort materials into two categories :   Paper products which consist of cardboard, paperboard, newspaper, brown paper bags, 
magazines, catalogs, b rochures, mail and telephone books; and commingled material which 
consists of  glass, tin, aluminum and steel food and beverage containers, and number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 7 plastics .  Vehicle and recyclable batteries, as well as used motor oil are also colle cted 
curbside for recycling.  Residents separate out yard waste such as palm fronds, shrubbery, leaves, and grass clippings and either bundle, bag in paper bags, or put it in garbage cans for collection.   The City also collects commercial ga rbage and recyclables.  Businesses choose from tote , 
dumpster or roll -off containers for both garbage and cardboard.  Other recyclables are collected 
using either 95- gallon totes or 18- gallon bins.  Minimum garbage collection  frequency is one time 
per week and offered up to five times per week.     For the management of emergency debris, a disaster debris monitoring contract and a disaster 
debris removal, reduction and disposal contract  have been secured.  Solid Waste will work closely 
with these private companies to ensure the timely and responsible removal of storm debris.  
Disposal and Resource Management  
 
Solid Waste assesses disposal options continually with a focus on resource recovery, efficiency and economics. Currently, garbage and construction & demolition material are delivered to the Sarasota County landfill, traditional recyclable materials to the Sarasota County Transfer Station for transfer to a recycled materials processing facility, and yard waste to a local chipping and mulching facility.  Metals and appliances are compiled at the Solid Waste yard for delivery to a recycling facility.  
 Solid Waste is charged a tipping fee for garbage and yard waste and receives revenue for recyclable materials.  
 Following are the tonnage s and costs for fiscal year 2014:

Special Events  
The City of North Port  Solid Waste Division , along with other agencies offers special events to 
promote proper solid waste management.  Household hazardous waste collection days are 
coordinated with Saraso ta County Solid Waste and held in North Port for citizen convenience.  
Participation on the Keep Sarasota County Beautiful advisory board targets ways to improve North Port’s environment with a ctivities such as the Florida Co astal Cleanup and the Great American 
Cleanup.          
 
Future Growth  
As the City grows , the Solid Waste Division will have increases in both personnel and equipment 
to meet the established service level  of one time per week garbage, recycling and yard waste 
collection and bulk collection as scheduled. Table 4 -11 below indicates  the anticipa ted residential 
growth from 2015 to 2020 and Solid Waste’s corresponding capital needs.  These capital needs 
are based on 1 garbage truck for every 3,000 residential units, 1 recycling truck for every 3,750 residential units, 1 yard waste truck for every 5,400 residential units and 1 claw truck for every 
12,500 residential units.

Sarasota County  also tracks growth projections in  planning future solid waste disposal needs.  
Their current disposal site, the Central County Solid Waste Disposal Complex, is expected to service 
the County’s solid waste disposal needs for at least the next 40 years.  
   
Solid Waste Concerns  
 
Concern 1: Maintaining service levels as growth increases.    
With the City of North Port projecting  increases in growth, the Solid Waste 
Division will need to  work closely with the Planning D epartment to adequately 
maintain the established level of service.  Capital acquisitions take a considerable 
amount of time and budget forecasts will need to anticipate equipment and personnel requirements. 
 Concern 2: Adjusting with changes in material management . 
Solid waste management is an ever changing field with new technologies and diverse waste materials shifting how waste is collected and managed.  Solid Waste will need to work with Sarasota County , other disposal facilities and processing 
facilities on changes in how the waste will be handled.  This will impact what types 
of collection equipment will be needed, what new commodities may be accepted and how the waste will be segregated.   
 Concern 3:    Transportation costs  
With increases in fuel and maintenance costs, Solid Waste will need to continue to explore ways to operate more efficiently.  Use of alte rnative fuels  and more 
efficient equipment , changes in how material is collected, and the feasibility of a 
transfer sta tion are all areas that will need to be investigated.  
 Concern 4: Public Outreach  
As changes occur in how waste is managed, the public will need to be kept abreast of how they will be affected.  Their support of and participation in proper waste management  is critical  to having a successful program.  Stormwater Management Element

Description of the City of  North Port Multi -Purpose Stormwater System  
 The City  of North Port is located in southeast  Sarasota County in the southern portion of the Big 
Slough Watershed, which covers approximately 196 square miles , in southwest Florida .  The 
headwaters of the Big Slough Watershed initiate  in the Mosaic (a phosphate mining company) 
land holdings in Desoto County.  Flows from t he watershed are mostly conveyed by the Big 
Slough Canal which extends in a southwesterly direction  from Desoto County through 
unincorporated portions of Manatee and Sarasota Count ies before traversing through the City of 
North Port .  The portion of the Big Slough Canal that traverses through the City is also known as 
the Myakkahatchee Creek.   The Myakkahatchee Creek discharges to the lower Myakka River  
just above the Myakka River ’s mouth at Charlotte Harbor  which then connect s to the Gulf of 
Mexico.  The current land use within the watershed  north of the City  boundary is predominantly 
agricultural with some mining activities  scattered therein .  
 Within the City of North Port boundaries, there are 79.1 miles  of manmade canals constructed by 
General Development Corporation (GDC) in the 1970’s.  These canals form a grid pattern and are interconnected with each other and with the Myakkahatchee Creek.  The R -36 Canal runs 
parallel to and along the City’s northern border with Sarasota County and is the primary east -
west canal north of the I -75 corridor.  This R -36 Canal also continues along the western border 
of the City and coveys flow in a north- south direction. There are two main east -west oriented 
canals located south of the I -75 corridor; the Snover Canal (to the north) and the Cocoplum 
Canal (located to the south).  These two canals are interconnected with multiple canals that run in a north- south direction.  The western ends of both the Snover Canal and the Cocoplum Canal 
discha rge to the Myakkahatchee Creek at separate locations along the creek.  Water levels within 
the Cocoplum Canal can stage up and flow either westward into the Myakkahatchee Creek or 
southward to neighboring Charlotte County via multiple water control structures.  These 
structures discharge to canals within Charlotte County that outfall to the Charlotte Harbor 
estuary system and ultimately to the Gulf of Mexico.  
 The City’s canal system is designed to accommodate several needs: water quality treatment, 
stormwa ter conveyance and attenuation; and a source for potable water supply.  Within the 
Myakkahatchee Creek/ canal grid  system, GDC installed  sixty -nine (69) water control structures 
of which thirty- three (33) are gated structures.   The control elev ations of the se structures are 
designed so that water is retained in the canals  in a step -down- elevation -system configuration; 
meaning t he water levels in the canal segments between structures progressively decrease in 
elevation from north to south and from east to west.  This system configuration allows both 
retention of storm water  runoff for water quality treatment and storage for potable water use.   
 
The City’s water treatment plant is located at the point of convergence of t he Cocoplum C anal 
with the Myakkahatchee Creek  (southwe st end of the drainage  system ).  In 2006, t he City  was 
issued a consumptive water use permit (WUP) to withdraw water from either the Myakkahatchee 
Creek or the Cocoplum  Waterway. Through manual opening of gates water can be slowly 
released from the canal grid system to supplement flow in the Myakkahatchee Creek, or as an Stormwater Management Element  
 4-31 alternative , the permit authorizes the water treatment plant to directly draw from  the Cocoplum 
Waterway .   
 
Background and History of North Port Flooding 
 
The City has exper ienced severe flooding from unnamed storms, tropical depressions and 
hurricanes occurring in: March 1987; Sept 1988; June 1992, 1995, and 2003; and August 2004.   
Given t he City of North Port is located in the lower elevations and bottom end of the Big 
Slough/Myakkahatchee Creek watershed, t he City’s  current flooding and water quality 
conditions are not solely caused by C ity’s development and growth but are additionally  caused 
by the accumulated upstream runoff from Sarasota, Manatee, and Desoto County porti ons of the 
watershed.  Most repetitive s evere flooding to date has been experienced in the North Port 
Estates area (north of the I -75 corridor) and areas immediately adjacent to Myakkahatchee 
Creek.   Construction of the I -75 corridor in 1977 further exacerbated flooding with in the Estates 
by causing restriction s to natural flows including a damming effect caused by the raised 
elevation of the highway and the limited number of floodways provided beneath the highway .  
Modifications made (concurrent with the highway construction) to the natural crossing at 
Myakkahatchee Creek  have been questioned by the Estates community in the past in regards to 
the I-75 bridge crossing’s  capacity to safely pass upstream historical flows  beneath the highway.   
This question was analyzed  and satisfactorily addressed by the Big Slough Watershed Study.   
 
Big Slough Watershed Study  
 The Big Slough Watershed Study , conducted by Ardaman and Associates under a cooperative 
funding agreement with  the Southwest Florida Water Management D istrict (SWFWMD)  and the 
City of North Port  began in 2003  and was completed in September, 2014.  Included in the scope 
of the study is a detailed watershed computer model created to simulate the hydraulic conditions of the Big Slough Watershed.  The model has been  calibrated  to simulate historic storm 
conditions and can be used as a tool to predict the level of flooding with in the City under various 
storm events . On September 13, 2016 , the updated 100- year floodplain  maps  (identified with an 
effective date of November 4, 2016) were adopted by the City.    
In addition to flood mapping, the Big Slough Watershed computer model was used to evaluate 
best management practices (BMPs) to develop a collection of potential stormwater improvement 
project  alternatives all engineered to eliminate/reduce flooding or improve water quality within 
the City.   Viable  BMP stormwater improvement projects were evaluated, including planning 
level cost estimates  for each project .  Additional BMP evaluation is proposed for FY 2017. Input 
from regulatory agencies such as SWFWMD, US Army Corporation of Engineers (ACOE), and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FFWCC) will be solicited early in this 
process to determine if the proposed projects are considered permissible.  
 The larger stormwater improvement projects are expected to take five ( 5) to ten (10)  years or 
more to fund, design, permit, construct and place i n operation .  Implementation of these projects  
may require cooperation with Charlotte, Desoto, Manatee, and Sar asota  Count ies, Federal, State 
and local agencies in regards to acquisition  of large tracts of land , funding, public workshops, 
rigorous review and  permitting .    Stormwater Management Element

Stormwater Improvement Program to Relieve Flooding  
 The BMP stormwater projects resulting  from the Big Slough Watershed Study will provide 
locally need ed and r egionally beneficial  improvements including lowering of flood stages and 
enhanced w ater quality within : upstream flows from the Big Slough Watershed; Myakkahatchee 
Creek ; the City’s  canal system ; downstream Charlotte County; the Myakka River ; Charlotte 
Harbor; and the Gulf of Mexico. 
 
The following drainage improvement projects are continuing efforts undertaken by the City: 
 
1. Replacement/Rehabilitation o f Water Control Structures  (WCS).  
 
Many  of the City’s e xisting water control structures  (WCS)  are forty (40) to fifty (50) 
years old .  Aging, functionality  and structural integrity c onditions vary between 
structures , but many are in dire need of rehabilitation.  D elays in the rehabilitation  
schedule increase the possib ility and risk for a potential massive failure of older 
deteriorated structures ; especially  during a severe storm event  or any event where there is 
exposure to harsh environmental conditions .  Water control structure failures can trigger 
other catastrophic mishaps such as downstream flooding and perhaps even washout of 
bridges.  Consequently, t he City retained a structural engineer to evaluate and prioritize , 
for rehabilitation or replacement , the worst water control structures.  The evaluation of 
the structures was performed and completed in 20 12.  Since this evaluation, 10 major 
water control structures (as of October 2016) have either been completely rehabilitated or 
replaced. The replacement/rehabilitation program will continue indefinitely and be an 
ongoing effort that will include a long term maintenance schedule for all water control  
structures within the City.  
 
2. Selective Dredging of C anals and Silted Areas in the Myakkahatchee Creek to Improve 
Conveyance.  
 
Dredging of the sil ted and heavily vegetated areas within the canal system and the 
Myakkahatchee Creek  will restore conveyance capacity  to acceptable conditions .  Of the  
84 miles of major manmade canals within the City, staff has identified nineteen ( 19) 
canal segments (thir ty-six ( 36) miles  in length) for further detailed evaluation  and 
prioritization (siltation and vegetation removal. )  The hierarchy priority for  removal of 
deposits is based on the severity of the silt deposits and vegetative growth  in relation to 
their siz e, location , and adverse impact on conveyance capacity.  Once dredging of these 
segments is executed, canal side banks will be stabilized (where needed ) to avoid 
exacerbating the siltation problem .  Dredging is an ongoing maintenance effort ; 
expensive, but important for the community to sustain . Stormwater Management Element  
 4-33  
3. Initiated an Effort to C lear the Myakkahatchee Creek of F allen Debris and Overhanging 
Vegetation.   
 
Fallen and overhanging debris or veget ation  restricts  water flows.  Consequently, t he 
Myakkahatchee Creek segment  between Price Blvd and Snover Waterway was cleared in 
2007.  A continuance of this effort will be scheduled each year as needed.  
 4. Improvements to the Local Roadside Swale System  to R elieve Chronic Nuisance Flooding 
from Local Neighborhoods.  
 
The City has  prioritized improvement projects that reduc e localized street flooding . These 
projects include re -grading of  roadside swales  and installation of  culvert crossings at 
intersections  to allow storm water to cross under the road through buried  concrete pipes , 
instead of just sheet  flow ing over  the asphalt .  This effort will reduce flooding and road 
deterioration  conditions .  This improvement program  began in 2006 and is an ongoing 
effort.  
 
5. Modification of Local R egulations to Encourage Low Impact Development  (LID) 
Concepts.  
 
Low Impact Development ( LID) concepts mitigate  adverse effects on the public drainage 
system  (and ultimately receiving waters) caused by the quantity and quality of 
stormwater runoff  flowing from properties.  LID principals stress and encourage 
conservation too.  A partial list of LID concepts includes: the use of pervious pavements ; 
“green” roofs ; Florida- friendly landscaping; bioswales ; rain cisterns ; and reuse of 
captured runoff within stormwater detention ponds .  LID concept s are current ly being 
encouraged  by staff and have been incorporated as a part of many  recent local 
development projects.  The City has incorporated the utilization of  LID methods to the 
maximum extent practicable  as part of the 2010 update to the  Unified Land Developm ent 
Code (ULDC) . 
 Water Quality  Improvement Program  
 The Myakkahatchee Creek and the interconnected canal system form one source for the City's 
drinking water supply.  Consequently, any stormwater detention projects planned or 
implemented in association wi th this source shall  provide the dual benefit of flood control and 
improvement in quality of the City's drinking supply.  
 
In the mid -1990’s, EPA delegated to the  Florida Department of Environmental Protection 
(FDEP) the implementation of  the stormwater ele ment of the f ederal National Pollutant 
Discharg e Elimination System (NPDES)  program.  This program places limits on storm water 
pollutants discharg ing into the waters of the United States  by issuing Municipal Separate Storm 
Sewer System (MS4) permits and ho lds local governments responsible for the quality of water 
that is released from the  permitted  drainage system .  The City of North  Port is a co -permittee  in 
an MS4 permit along with Sarasota County, City of Sarasota, City of Venice, Town of Longboat Stormwater Management Element  
 4-34 Key, and FDOT .  MS4 permit conditions are ongoing and renewed on a five ( 5) year cycle.    
The current permit  was issued in January of 2014.  The recent draft  MS4 p ermit  adds a new 
condition that requires the City of North  Port and its co -permittees to achieve Total Maximum 
Daily Loads  (TMDLs) targeted at identified constituents which  adversely impact local receiving 
waters .  A TMDL represents the maximum amount of a given pollutant that a water body can 
assimilate  and still meet water quality standards and its  designated uses. TMDLs will require  
development and implementation of a Basin Management Action Plan, or BMAP, to reduce the 
pollutant loading.   
 
The City is currently looking at ways to control  pollutants through source reduction.  Behavior 
modification through education is an effective means of preventing contaminants from entering waterbodies, as well as an economical alternative to structural or physical removal of 
contaminants that have infiltrated storm water discharges. 
 In its effort to reduce nitrog en and phosphorus loading to the waterways, the City adopted a 
Fertilizer Ordinance that went into effect  on December 14, 2007.   The Ordinance places 
restrictions on types of allowable fertilizers and application rates.  At least 50% of the nitrogen 
conte nt in the fertilizers needs  to be in the slow release form.  No turf fertilization will be 
allowed during the rainy season which is defined locally as occurring June 1st through September  30th.   A fertilizer free zone is required adjacent to water bodies and conveyances  and 
rotary fertilizer spreaders must have a deflector shield  to avoid introduction of fertilizer granules 
into any waterway.   Commercial and i nstitutional fertilizer applicators must be certified by 
March 13, 2008 through a training program  offered by the Sarasota County Extension Service.   
In addition to certifying commercial and institutional applicators, e fforts are currently underway 
to educate the public on the proper use of fertilizers  too.  Pamphlets with the details of the 
importance of the ordinance are available to citizens and staff has posted this information on the 
City website and contacted local fertilizer suppliers and outlets.     
 
Improperly maintained septic systems are known to leach into and contaminate the City’s 
waterways.  Consequently, the City is also looking at ways to expand the City’s central sewer 
system and to reduce dependency on septic systems.  Residents are encouraged to conduct  
frequent and routine  inspection and maintenance of their septic systems to preven t pollution 
before it happens.  Current land planning mechanisms  are in place to discourage the proliferation 
of septic systems .  Local ordinances require homeowners to decommission septic systems and 
connect to central sewer service when it becomes available.   Within d esignated Conservation 
Restriction Zones (CRZs) on -site alternative wastewater treatment systems such as Aerobic 
Treatment Units (ATUs) are required instead of the conventional septic systems.  These ATU 
systems are expected to provide a grea ter level of treatment and reduce the adverse impacts of 
conventional septic systems on the environment.  An example of a CRZ is the area of close 
proximity to the Myakkahatchee Creek. 
 
The City has a water quality sampling program to monitor key pollutant s at strategic locations 
within the C reek and the Cocoplum W aterway.  
 Stormwater Management Element  
 4-35 Stormwater Level of Service (LOS)  
 
The stormwater level of service (LOS) standard is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of 
stormwater management systems  and prioritizing major  capital improvement needs  according to 
the severity of the service level deficiency .  There are two major components to stormwater 
LOS : 
(1) Quality of stormwater  discharge; 
(2) Quantity of discharge and acceptable flooding.  
 
Quality of Stormwater Discharg e 
 Level of service criteria for stormwater quality should be consistent with the pollutant load 
reduction goals established by the State and Federal water quality regulations.  Development activities (excluding currently platted single -family lots) shall not violate the water quality 
standards as required by SWFWMD and  set forth in Chapters 62- 4, 62- 302, 62- 520, 62- 522 and 
62-550, F.A.C., including any antidegradation provisions of paragraphs 62- 4.242(1)(a) and (b), 
subsections 62- 4.242(2) and (3), and Rul e 62-302.300, F.A.C.  In addition, the City shall also 
implement a stormwater quality management program consistent with the NPDES requirements 
as documented in the  NPDES MS4 permit.  
 
Quantity of Discharge a nd Acceptable Flooding  
 Existing System – The existing  primary canal and ditch drainage system  was designed by GDC 
for a 10- year frequency , 5-day duration, storm event.  Over  a forty ( 40) to fifty (50)  year time 
period, the City’s canal system has accumulated silt deposits which have reduced the conveya nce 
capacity  in several locations .  The City currently has a program to remove this siltation and to 
restore the canals to their original design capacity . 
 New Developments – In the existing City of North Port Comprehensive P lan and Unified Land 
Developmen t Code (ULDC), the City follows the SWFWMD criteria for permitting new surface 
water management systems which is a design storm event with a 25 -year frequency, 24-hour 
duration.  For the design storm event, the new surface water management system must prov ide 
sufficient storage volume so that the post -development peak discharge rate is no greater than the 
pre-development peak discharge rate .  SWFWMD has revised  rule language  to require designing 
for a more intense storm event for areas of known flooding.

COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ELEMENT 
 
CONSERVATION SECTION  
INTRODUCTION 
Located in south Sarasota County, North Port was incorporated as a city in 1959. Its developer, 
General Development Corporation, platted some 70,000 residential lots within the City’s original 
80+ square miles. With annexations, the City now encompasses about 104 square miles, making it one of the largest cities in Florida by land area.  
For its first three -plus decades, the City grew slowly with the gradual influx of retiree s from the 
north. In the early 1990’s, the City entered a period of rapid growth fueled by low housing costs  
and the city’s proximity to Sarasota and Fort Myers via Interstate 75. The median age of City 
residents has shifted from the mid to late 60’s to the early 40’s as working families moved into 
newly constructed City homes.  
The Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research 2016 estimate of the City’s population 
was 64,312 residents. While North Port is currently experiencing an expansion in commercial 
development, local officials estimate that as of early 2016, North Port was still only 20 to 25  
percent developed.  
North Port and its elected officials have consistently supported measures to conserve the City’s 
natural resources. A few examples include:  
• Conversion of the former General Development Corporation- owned Myakka Estates 
development project into the 8,593- acre Myakka State Forest in 1995. The City regards 
the Forest as an irreplaceable resource that must be preserved for generations to come.  
• The continuing assembly of land to create the 700-plus- acre Myakkahatchee Creek 
Greenway, a protective conservation buffer for the Class I waters of the Myakkahatchee Creek.  
• Identification of substantial conservation corridor acreage in the City’s northeast ern 
quadrant, as well as a large corridor on the Thomas Ranch.  
• Development of the West Villages  is guided by the City’s “Village” Land Use 
designation and code, which requires extensive analysis of environmental conditions before any development may occur . 
• Ordinance No. 07-47, along with amendments via Ordinance No. 2011- 32 and Ordinance 
No. 2013-19 of the City’s Tree Protection Regulations. 
• On September 24
th, 2007, the City of North Port signed the ‘State -Local Agreement for 
Administering the Myakka Wild and Scenic River Protection Zone Between the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Florida Department of Community Affairs  
(DCA), that is now part of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) , and 
the City of North Port.’ 
                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element

2005 EVALUATION AND APPRAISAL REPORT  
The Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR) identified 13 major issues facing the City of North 
Port, three of them pertaining to conservation of resources: 
1. Water Resources – The Citizen Advisory Committees (CACs) assembled for  the EAR 
process expressed concern about the City’s ability to identify sources of potable water to satisfy the needs generated by growth. Updated in 2005, the City’s Water and Sewer Master Plan identifies a variety of existing sources and calls for examin ing other sources 
of raw water, such as the City’s waterway system and borrow pit lakes. The Comprehensive Plan should contain measures to ensure adequate coordination and planning in order to provide potable water through identification of alternative res ources, 
including regional solutions, the EAR declared. 
2. Clear Cutting of Trees – Most CAC members expressed the opinion that the 
ordinance as it existed in 2005 was not strong enough, especially as it relates to non-
residential development. CAC members recommended far more severe fines for violations and wanted to ensure that the City’s tree fund (fines and mitigation payments paid by developers) is accessible for City projects. They further recommended that the tree fund be administered separately from the City’s general fund. These concerns have been addressed in City Ordinance No. 07-47; the City’s recently revised Tree Protection 
Ordinance.  
3. Continuation of the Myakkahatchee Creek Initiative – Continued acquisition of 
land to protect the Myakkahatchee Creek as a potable water and recreational resource was strongly supported by the CACs. They also agreed that this initiative will help reduce the damage caused by flood events. As of late 2015, the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway, the name recently chosen by the City to represent this initiative, comprises approximately  700 acres. Upon successful completion of the project, the City expects that 
over 740 acres of critical floodplain will have been preserved. Implementation of the project received a big boost  in November 2007, when the Governing Board of the then 
DCA’s  Florida Forever  program awarded the City a matching grant of $2.8 million for 
the acquisition of more property within the Greenway. 
CITY’S PERFORMANCE ON CONSERVATION / COASTAL 
MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
Protected species  
The 2005 EAR noted that  the City has continued to work with state and federal wildlife agencies 
to ensure that protected wildlife species issues are addressed. A bald eagle protection zone was established on one of the City DRI properties, and the City has worked with the agencies to ensure that builders and developers are securing the proper permits when endangered species, such as gopher tortoises, are encountered on sites. 
In 2005, issues arose concerning documented and potential scrub jay habitat in the City. The City 
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service worked together to develop an updated scrub jay database                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-6 that helps government protect the species and gives land owners and land buyers the information 
they need in order to make sound decisions. 
The City and the USFWS jointly developed  a reliable scrub jay database for  North Port. The 
USFWS provided the City with the specific locations of known scrub jay colonies and all 
impacted lots within 850 feet of each colony. Based upon this new information, North Port Planning staff created a new map to show the specific areas affected in North Port, as well as a list of affected lots by parcel ID  numbers . The USFWS also produced a packet explaining 
procedures that a land owner must follow wh en his  property is affected  by scrub jays . 
The EAR also identifies several options the City might pursue in order to address the scrub jay 
issue in an even more comprehensive way: 
• Work with Sarasota County as the County prepares its Scrub Jay Habitat Conse rvation 
Plan (HCP) . 
• Have the County establish mitigation areas in North Port where scrub habitat is known to 
exist, such as the properties along portions of the Myakkahatchee Creek.  This would 
accomplish the goal of preserving known scrub habitat that could be utilized by jays and would aid in accomplishing the City goal of protecting the Myakkahatchee Creek corridor.  
• If the City chooses not to work with the County to include North Port areas in the County 
HCP, North Port may have to either develop its own HCP, or   
• Let the USFWS handle scrub jay issues on a case by case basis, at greater expense to the 
affected property/homeowner.  
The EAR concluded that the updated Comprehensive Plan should have policy language 
addressing the scrub jay issue and program. 
Myakka Wild and Scenic River  
The EAR reported  that the City continues to adhere to the Myakka River Wild and Scenic Rule, 
Chapter 62D -15, F.A.C., which was adopted in 1991 to protect th e State designated Myakka 
Wild and Scenic River. The 1997 iteration of the Comprehe nsive Plan includes policy language 
to strengthen the City ’s commitment to abide by the R ule, especially as it relates to the future 
development of the West Villages  and the proposed River Road Office Park facilities. In 2007, 
the City entered i nto the “S tate-Local Agreement for A dministering the Myakka River Wild and 
Scenic River Protection Zone. ”  As a result of the ‘Myakka River Wild and Scenic Designation 
and Preservation Act,’ (Section 258.501 F .S.) and the Agreement, the City will be adopti ng an 
ordinance for regulating activities in the Protection Zone.  T he City will, as needed, amend  its 
Unified Land Development Code  and other appropriate regulations so that the regulations  that 
affect the Protection Zone conform to, or are more stringent  than, the Act, the Plan, and the 
Agreement.  
 
                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-7 Conservation practices on annexed lands 
Since the 1997 Comprehensive Plan was approved, North Port has annexed over 30 square miles 
of property . The largest of these, the West Villages  and the former Kelce Ranch, are each over 
5,000 acres in area. The EAR notes that both contain habitat “worthy of protection.” 
The southern portion of the West Villages  has a large wetland system . While t he City has 
designated this system  as “Village” instead of “Conservation” on the Future Land Use map , the 
intention by the developer of the West Villages is  to allow limited passive recreational and 
educational opportunities in portions of the system while essentially accomplishing the overall 
intent of preserving the habitat.  
In a similar manner, the City applied a “Recreation/Open Space” designation to a wetland system 
on the Kel ce Ranch, while limiting density on nearby land uses by applying the large -lot 
“Agricultural Estates” designation. “ The system on the Kel ce property,” s aid the EAR, “probably 
represents one of the better native habitats in this portion of the County, and the City should be very careful in examining any development proposals in the far eastern section of the property.” 
Tree protection  
The need for revising  the City’s Tree Protection Regulations owes much to North Port’s pattern 
of development. General Development Corporation (GDC), the private corporation that developed the City, platted approximately 95% of the  pre-2000 City into single -family lots 
measuri ng roughly 80 by 125 feet  (10,000 square feet) in size. Development of most of these lots 
has required that positive drainage be maintained  and septic systems and wells installed.  
The filling of lots in order to meet these requirements tends to damage the  root system of trees, 
making preservation  difficult. Due to these constraints, the City has found it difficult, though not 
impossible, to balance the need to protect trees with the right of owners to enjoy their property. 
The City of North Port  remains co mmitted to  the goal of maintaining through preservation and 
planting 80% of its tree canopy , as originally stated in the 1997 Comprehensive Plan. According 
to standard practice, any lands that are located within the City (including protected lands that are  
maintained in a conservation easement by a federal, state, or other agency) can be counted as part 
of the City’s tree canopy. The goal is being implemented through conservation-minded management of City parks and rights -of-way, street  landscaping , as well  as the presence of the 
Myakka River State F orest , which is located almost entirely within City  borders.   
Since 1997, the City has amended its  tree code in an attempt to make it stronger. Building 
Department  staff has been added to conduct and verify tree surveys on residential sites, while 
Planning & Zoning Department  staff makes  determina tions on non- residential sites.  
The Tree Protection Ordinance, in its amended pre -2007 form, also included fines for violations . 
Developers who do not or cannot save trees on building sites are also required to pay fees into a reforestation trust fund (“Tree Fund”).  The EAR recommended that the City must do more to 
ensure that these funds are reserved for tree protection/reforestation only. 
In 2007, the City again amended the tree protection code by means of City Ordinance No. 07 -47. 
Answering the EAR’s concern regarding the Tree Fund, the Ordinance now specifies that the 
Fund will be used for (1) purchasing property to preserve trees ; (2) e ducat ing the public on tree                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-8 preservation; (3) m aintaining tree h ealth and safety on public land; and (4) purchasing 
conservation e asements.  
Following are a few  of the changes made to Chapter 45, Tree Protection Regulations, following 
the City Commission’s passage of City Ordinance No. 07-47: 
• Tree Removal Permits can only be issued after approval of a Development Order. 
• For single -family residential lots, the tree canopy coverage per lot requirement has been 
established at  35% due to the constraints inherent to standard 80 x 125-foot lots ( Objective 3 
in this element has been revised to indicate the 35% figure, hence there is a range in that 
objective that appears quite large as the City’s ultimate goal remains at 80%, but that cannot occur in areas dominated by single -family platted lots.)  
• Tree Protection Standards have been increased to require barricades at the drip line, regular 
inspections during development and a revised fine schedule with increased penalties for non-
compliance.  
Historic/archaeological preservation  
During the period of  time evaluated in the EAR report, the City developed and adopted an 
Archaeological Preservation Ordinance that is consistent with Sarasota County regulations. 
The City also continued to support ongoing scientific and preservation activities at the Little Salt 
Springs archaeological site. The County has purchased and preserved two dozen ancient burial sites on property near Little Salt Springs. One of the sites near Little Salt Springs was preserved 
through the City’s action after a citizen reported that it was being prepared for development. City 
staff immediately “red -flagged” the site and halted further construction activities. Since then, the 
site has been acquired and preserved.  
Warm Mineral Springs, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in  1977, is located 
within a parcel annexed by the City in 2002 and purchased by the City in late 2014. One of the 
earliest tourist attractions in southwest Florida, Warm Mineral Springs continues to attract those who believe its waters have restorative powers. For several years, Florida State University funded underwater exploration of the sinkhole that formed the Springs, and in the process recovered ancient human remains and the fossilized bones of extinct species like the giant ground sloth and a species of saber -toothed cat.  
The Future Land Use Element has several policies devoted to preservation of not only the archaeological values of Warm Mineral Springs, but also the nearby manatee habitat  in the 
outflow area of the Springs (Salt Creek) . Following  are three examples:  
Policy 2.7.1 provides for the protection of the Springs while also permitting a limited mixture of 
residential, office, professional, institutional and commercial uses.  
Policy 2.7.9 requires potential developers of multi- family residentia l units, commercial or office 
buildings to contact Florida Department of Environmental Protection manatee experts to determine best management practices for development and any mitigation necessary to protect manatees on property abutting the creek that flows  from Warm Mineral Springs to the Myakka 
River.                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-9 As protect ion from incompatible development, Policy 2.7.2 creates a 7.02- acre conservation 
buffer around the Springs and the creek concurrently with approval of development applications . 
Except for a few l imited maintenance and access facilities, no new development will be 
permitted within this buffer area.  
The City continues to work with property owners in an area called the “Atwater Site” in the 1997 
Plan. It is hoped that this property can be acquired and preserved during the term of this current 
update of the Comprehensive Plan. 
Coastal zone management 
The Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway project continues to be a major initiative for the City.  
Expansion of the Creek corridor through the acquisition of the second tier of lots along each side of the Creek will reduce densities in the FEMA “A” zone, which in turn will reduce the number of structures that could be damaged in a flood event. Since no homes will be built upon these properties, the function of the floodway will be enhanced. The FEMA’s Flood Insurance Rate 
Maps (FIRM) have recently been updated  (with an effective date of November 4, 2016) , and 
provide the first flood maps and flood area determinations for all areas of the City. In contrast, the previ ous FIRM for North Port only covered a small portion of the City and was published in 
1981 and 1984 for the annexed West Villages  area. While a larger section of the City is now 
located within the FEMA “A” zone with the updated map, most of these areas are  in existing 
streets that allow for stormwater to sheet flow to the nearest canal. Because of this, nearly all the homes and structures that have been built in these area are above the 100- year flood plain due to 
the need to provide enough elevation for septic systems to work. Additionally, all future homes and structures will be required to be built above this level through the utilization of fill on building sites and by adherence to Florida Building Code regulations that require a fixed floor elevation above the flood plain.  
The EAR notes that the City has “fought hard” for improvements to the Toledo Blade Boulevard 
Hurricane Evacuation Route. C onstruction to widen Toledo Blade to four lanes began in 2007 
and were completed in 2012, thanks in large part to construction agreements negotiated by the 
City with developers and Charlotte County. In addition, the widening of Sumter Blvd to four 
lanes between Interstate 75 and US 41 was completed in 2015. The City is currently working 
with Sarasota County and other agencies to identify funding that will enable the widening of Price Boulevard and the development of stormwater ponds that would assist in protecting the usability of the only east -west corridor in the City between Interstate 75 and US 41 during storm 
events. 
Hurricane evacuation  
Over the last two decades,  Sarasota County and Charlotte County have worked together to 
design improvements to the River Road corridor that would result in a better connection to the Cape Haze peninsula and would serve the vital  functions of hurricane evacuation and economic 
development. The project was termed the “Englewood Interstate Connector.” 
The City of North Port played a very important role in development of this corridor through its 
amendment of the Conservation and Coas tal Management Element , which allowed the 
construction of the Winchester Boulevard hurricane evacuation route to be extended through the “Conservation” designated Myakka State Forest in North Port  and south of State Route 776 to                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-10 State Route 775 in Charlotte County. Winchester Boulevard is now a component of the 
Englewood Interstate Connector design. It should also be noted that Winchester Boulevard 
traverses a known scrub jay area within the State Forest. 
The City has also continued to work very closely wit h all applicable emergency management 
agencies to prepare for and support those agencies in times of need. In 2010  the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council completed its update to the Regional 
Hurricane Evacuation Plan. The coastal high hazard area along the Myakka River was among the 
map revisions. The Sarasota County School District’s construction of new schools and the hardening of older 
schools have created additional shelter space. The City continues to encourage developers to build common facilities in new developments to the latest hurricane shelter standards.  
CONSERVATION DATA AND ANALYSIS  
NATURAL RESOURCES  
Rivers, wetlands, estuarine marshes, groundwater and air  
Myakka River . The Myakka River system is an extremely valuable resource because o f 
its natural beauty, recreational significance, vegetation and wildlife habitat area, as well as its  natural purification system for surface water and groundwater. The Myakka River is 
roughly 66 miles long and drains a roughly 600 square- mile area before entering 
Charlotte Harbor. The River’s headwaters are located in the swamps of Manatee Count y. 
Ranching and agriculture are the major land uses in the northern portions of this basin. 
Approximately two miles of the southern portion of the Myakka River flows through the 
extreme southwestern part of the City of North Port. The Big Slough  (Myakkahatchee 
Creek) , one of four major tributaries  of the River, and Little Salt Creek in Warm Mineral 
Springs have been channelized to some degree.  
Residential waterfront  development above Snook Haven (Venice Farms Road) and below 
the Playmore residential development south of U.S . Highway  41, as well as almost the 
entire eastern shoreline of the River below US 41 in the unincorporated county, has led to some shoreline stab ilization. Otherwise, the uplands drained by the River are used 
agriculturally or are managed for scenic values and wildlife habitat preservation. Within 
the Myakka River State Park contiguous wetlands occupy broad lowlands adjacent to the lakes . Downstrea m, hammocks are found along the river. The R iver below the My akka 
River State Park is desi gnated as critical habitat for the Federally Endangered  West 
Indian Manatee by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  
The Myakka was  designated a State Wild and Scenic Ri ver in 1985 through the adoption 
of the Myakka River Wild and Scenic Designation and Preservation Act (‘Act’) Chapter 
258.501, F .S.  The Act also established a Myakka River Management Coordinating 
Council to provide interagency and intergovernmental coordination in the management of the river.  In 1994, the Sarasota County Board of County Commissioners appointed a 
nine- member citizen advisory board, the Myakka River Planning Advisory Board, to 
provide recommendations for an ordinance that would incorporate goals and objectives of                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-11 the Myakka Wild and Scenic River  Management Plan and the County’ s Comprehensive 
Plan. These recommendations include policies for managing the Wild and Scenic River 
Protection Zone, as defined in the Act. 
In 2007, the City entered into the “S tate-Local Agreement  for Administering the Myakka 
River Wild and Scenic  Protection Zone”  with the Florida Department of E nvironmental 
Protection and what was then known as  the Florida Department of Community Affairs  to 
administer the portion of the Wild and Scenic River Protection Zone that is within the 
City.    
Estuarine marshes.  According  to the Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan, estuarine 
edges are found along the Myakka River. The City participates in the reoccurring 
quarterly meeting held under the establishment of the Myakka River Management Coordinating Committee (MRMCC).  
The waters of the southern portion of the Big Slough Watershed ultimately flow into Charlotte Harbor via the Myakkahatchee Creek and the Myakka River. The City of North Port has long supported protection of the Harbor’s estuaries and marine resources as an 
active participant in the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program (CHNEP).  
The CHNEP was created in 1995 by Section 320 of the Clean Water Act. The federal 
component of  the Program operating funding is administered through the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA). Receipt of these federal funds obligates the Program to adopt an annual workplan, adopt a  Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan  
(CCMP) , provide monitoring reports and undergo a CCMP implementation review with 
EPA every three years.  
The CHNEP  is a partnership of citizens, elected officials,  resource managers and 
commercial and recreational resource users working to improve the water  quality and 
ecologi cal integrity of the greater Charlotte Harbor watershed. A cooperative decision -
making process is used within the program to address diverse resource management  
concerns in the 4,400- square mile study area. The City Commission actively participates 
at the decision -making level by appointing one of its own members to serve on the 
CHNEP’s Policy Committee . City staff also serves on the CHNEP Management 
Committee.  
The City of North Port is also one of m any of CHNEP  partners that financially support 
the Program , others being the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Southwest Florida 
Water Management District , South Florida Water Management District, Florida 
Department of Environmental Protection , Florida Coastal Zone Management Program , 
Peace River/Manasota Reg ional Water Supply Authority , Polk, Sarasota, Manatee, Lee, 
Charlotte, DeSoto and Hardee Counties , Cities of Sanibel, Cape Coral, Fort Myers, Punta 
Gorda, Venice,  Fort Myers Beach and Winter Haven , and the Southwest Florida Regional 
Planning Council. 
Groun dwater.  As of early 2008, the Sarasota County Health Department (SCHD) 
report s no significant health and public safety problems associated with the use of private 
wells in the City of North Port. Further, no specific areas of the City experience a higher rate of well contamination than  any other area of the City. Problems with private wells  
are infrequently reported and geographically scattered.                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-12 However, a lmost half of all residential and commercial units (49.2 percent) in the City 
are served by septic systems, and  one- third of all units are served by private wells. As a 
public policy matter, the City is concerned that the quality and safety of groundwater may 
be threatened with further proliferation of septic systems and wells as the City continues to develop. 
Although water and sewer services are being extended to major new subdivisions as 
financing agreements with private developers are implemented, most central water and sewer service connections are within the original core area of the City.  
The 2005 EAR recommended that the City should be more aggressive in extending potable water and sanitary sewer service throughout the City. However, the ability to achieve this recommendation was subsequently hampered with the downturn in the real estate market, limiting resources that could be allocated for system improvements. With 
the passage and pending implementation of the updated North Port Utilities Master Plan, 
the City will continue to expand central utility services into existing neighborhoods. The 
City h as enacted and will continue to enforce the regulations created by Administrative 
Code Section  78-60 which requires all home and business owners on private wells to 
hook into the City of North Port’s central potable water system within 365 days of the service becoming available to them.  
Myakkahatchee Creek/Big Slough. The EAR observes that in platted lands 
communities  like North Port, much of the original natural habitat has been compromised 
by the development of roads , canals,  and building lots associated with the original 
platting. Therefore,  few significant native habitat areas are in need of preservation. The 
areas along  Myakkahatchee Creek are among st the best preserved habitats in the City. 
Myakkahatchee Creek , otherwise known as the Big Slough, represents a principal source 
of raw water supply for the City of North Port . The North Port Utilities Department 
reported that in the 12-month period ending September  2007, the Myakkahatchee Creek 
supplied almost 44 percent of the potable water used by customer s of North Port Utilities. 
During the 2003 drought, the City was able to send some 30 million gallons of Creek water to Charlotte County, proving beyond doubt that the Creek is important not just to the City, but to the region. 
The Myakkahatchee Creek /Big Slough originates in eastern Manatee County  and flows 
for approximately 7.25 miles through the City before reaching the North Port Utilities 
Department’s  Water Treatment Plant . The Creek continues for another 2.75 miles, ending 
at its confluence with the M yakka River. One of the major tributaries  of the Myakka 
River, it has been channelized to some degree.  
Artesian springs  contribute a small percentage of the Big Slough’s flow.  
The Peace River.  The City of North Port purchases treated surface water from the Peace 
River /Manasota R egional Water Supply Authority . The Peace River,  a large river by 
Florida standards, originates in northern Polk County and has  a drainage area of 2,300 
square miles. The Peace River headwaters originate in the Green Swamp of norther n Polk 
County, flowing through Lake Hancock, the Winter Haven chain of lakes, and Lake 
Hamilton. The mouth of the Peace River is located at Punta Gorda, 120 miles                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-13 downstream from the headwaters, delivering needed fresh water to the Charlotte Harbor 
estuary . 
The North Port and the Peace River Water Treatment Plants  use a conventional surface 
water and color removal process consisting of taste and odor control, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, disinfection and stabilization  as primary wat er 
treatment techniques.  
Air quality.  Sarasota and Charlotte Counties, including the City of North Port, are 
considered “attainment areas,” which means that the area has not exceeded the national ambient air quality standards set by the federal government.  Currently, no air quality 
monitoring facilities are located in North Port.  
No new facilities that produce large quantities of air pollution have located in North Port since 1997. Although the City has grown and traffic congestion has increased, it has not  
increased to levels that cause air quality problems.  
Sarasota County measures f our air -quality parameters – ozone, carbon monoxide, 
particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide – on a continuous basis 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week. Particulate matter is mon itored every sixth day for 24 hours.  
Current  monitoring sites operated by the County are located at Brookside Middle School, 
the U.S. 41 Bypass in Venice, Bee Ridge Park, the Sarasota County Courthouse, the City of Sarasota’ s reverse osmosis plant, South Lido Park, and Goff Communications in 
Venice. The County has plans to operate a nitrogen oxide (NO
x) monitor that will record 
NO x emissions 24 hours a day, seven days a week at the Brookside Middle School site. 
The air quality in the County is considered good and has not exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency’ s (EPA) and Florida Department of Environmental Protection’ s 
(FDEP) established standards to date.  
Sarasota County ’s Local Air Pollution Control Program complies with the Florida Air 
and Water P ollution Control Act, Chapter 403 Florida Statutes. 
Floodplain  
On behalf of the City of North Port, a consultant  was contracted by the Southwest  Florida Water 
Management District to conduct tasks associated with developing  a Watershed  Management 
Program fo r the North Port/Big Slough Watershed, the southern portion of which constitutes 
North Port’s floodplain.  Included among the consultant’s tasks was  performance of a detailed floodplain analysis  
involving computer modeling and  mapping of floodplains at 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500- year 
recurrence intervals. The project was initiated in July 2003 and was completed September 2014. The Big Slough Watershed is  located in southeastern Sarasota County . The Myakkahatchee 
Creek /Big Slough Canal , the central artery of  the Watershed,  begins in the southeastern part of 
Manatee County (near  Edgeville) and flows through the City , finally emptying in to the estuarine 
portion of the Myakka River. Its headwaters are rural, consisting  primarily of agricultural and 
undeveloped l ands. Within the City , the vast majority of urban and developed  lands occur in the 
southern portion of the watershed .                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-14 The 195.5 square -mile Big Slough W atershed encompasses many  depressional features, 
including wetlands  and water bodies, the most prominent  of which is the Big Slough Canal , also 
known as Myakkahatchee Creek with in North Port . The Big Slough Canal  passes from north to 
south through the City and receives inflows  from an internal system of waterways which provide 
surface drainage throughout the City.  
The Big Slough W atershed is characterized by flat topography and sandy, shelly , and silty sand 
soils with little organic matter. Low permeability, hydric soils associated  with depressional areas 
and flood plains are predominant within the Watershed.   
Surface drainage throughout  most of  the W atershed north of the City consists largely of natural 
sloughs and creeks , and many  manmade ditches , canals  and waterways within the City. Within  
the City of North Port , surface drainage is provided by an extensive canal system, which 
discharges primarily to the Big Slough Canal. Some surface drainage occurs via conveyance 
structures southward into the Port Charlotte conveyance system.  
Two surface water features unique to the area are Warm Mineral Springs and  Little Salt Spring 
in North Port . They  are the southernmost springs in the  Southwest Florida W ater Management 
District. 
While the headwaters of the Big  Slough Watershed remain predominantly undeveloped or 
agricultural, changes in  land uses throughout the City of North Port reflect significant population 
growth, as well as continued commercial and industrial growth along the U.S. 41 corridor. Watershed/Floodplain Analysis: The  consultant attempted  to identify and gather historical 
rainfall and  discharge data for  model calibration and verification. However, due to insufficient  
streamflow data, it was deemed impractical to perform a traditional model calibration. Instead, 
the consultant confirmed modeling results in consultation with City of North  Port staff, who 
strongly corroborated results of the simulation for a major  2003 flood event. The consultant’s  
staff visited the North Port area in 2004 just  after Hurricane  Charley  to gain first -hand 
knowledge and to record findings of flooding issues for  later model veri fications. R ainfall events 
verified by the consultant included 13.08 inches over  five days for the 2003 flood event and 
10.34 inches over seven  days for the 2004 rainfall event.  
The consultant’s  staff both observed and mapped flooding conditions during Aug ust 2004. Using  
comparisons with previous studies and limited streamflow data available for the watershed , the 
consultant confirmed that its  model can be used for floodplain delineation and level of service 
evaluations. After running the model to delineate  the 100- year and 500- year recurrence storms, the consultant 
compared the results against FEMA’s digital 100 -year floodplains through two GIS analysis 
methods. First, 100- year categories  were selected from the FEMA floodplains layer and their 
total acreage  within the  watershed was calculated and compared to the area inundated by the 
North  Port/Big Slough 100- year floodplain model . Then, both the FEMA and North Port/Big 
Slough floodplain layers were intersected with a parcels layer  provided by the Sarasota C ounty , 
generating a count of the number of inundated parcels. The count includes those parcels for which more than one -half of their area are within the 
mapped floodplain. This count is not indicative of structural flooding, as the great majority of 
homes are constructed on fill.   Based on 2016 City data, less than 500 lots have structures on                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-15 them that would be located within the 100- year floodplain. Table 5-1 presents a summary of the 
results of those two comparisons. 
As can be seen, storm event simulation s for the North Port/Big Slough floodplain model suggest 
a significantly larger area and a substantially greater number of parcels  are at risk for  flooding , as 
compared to the currently adopted FEMA flood risk area. (It should be noted, however, that 
FEMA mapped only a small portion of the City before issuing the FIRM maps in September 
1981.)

On May 4, 2016, the City of North Port re ceived a letter of final determination from FEMA 
requiring the City of North Port to adopt the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) with an effective date of November 4, 2016, for continued eligibility in the NFIP  and to reflect  updates to the Florida Building Code . On September 13, 2016, the City 
adopted the FIRM and FIS via an amendment to Chapter 17 of the City’s Unified Land Development Code.  
Commercially valuable minerals 
No survey of commercially valuable minerals has ever  been done in North Port, nor are minerals 
currently being extracted in the City. A limited number of fill/shell operations are still active.  
Soil and water erosion  
As of early 2008, the U.S. Soil and Water Conservation District for Sarasota County had no direct knowledge of landowners contributing to erosion or water pollution in North Port. Sarasota County’s Comprehensive Plan also reports no widespread soil erosion problems  
throughout the County.  
Some grower groups in watersheds affecting the City have signed agreements with the State 
Department  of Agriculture  and Consumer Services  to follow best ma nagement practices for 
certain row crop commodities. Similarly, area cattlemen are in the process of revising best 
management practices, according to Jack Creighton, District Conservationist  for Manatee and 
Sarasota Counties .                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-16 In 2005 and 2006, City staff documented areas of human- caused soil and water erosion in the 
Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway , on several privately -owned parcels in the eastern portion of 
the C ity, and along other City waterways. Much of the damage was determined to have been 
caused by the unauthorized use of off -road vehicles.  On July 10, 2006, the North Port City 
Commission adopted City Ordinance No. 06- 13, later designated as §§ 74-131--74-134 Sec. 74 -
133 in the City’s Administrative  Code. By the provisions of this legislation, the City prohibited 
the use of off -road vehicles, motorcycles and ATVs on public property. Use of these vehicles 
was also prohibited on private property except by the property owner, their family and guests.  
While this is somewhat lowered the use of ATV’s within the City, the unauthorized use of 
ATV’s on public and private properties continues to be an issue in areas of the City outside of the Urban Service Boundary, par ticularly in Activity Center 6.  
Soil erosion can  also be a problem during the construction activities of development. 
There have been instances of minor erosion along the banks of the Myakkahatchee Creek in the navigable areas of the Creek, south of U.S. 41. Shore protection structures, such as sea walls and rip-rap, have been used to mitigate the impacts of erosion on private property in that area.

Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway –Myakkahatchee Creek, the central artery of the Big 
Slough Watershed, enters the City at its northern boundary and flows southwesterly 
through the City until it joins the Myakka River, which in turn flows into Charlotte Harbor and the Gulf of Mexi co.

just north of the U.S. Highway 41 bridge in the City’s original “downtown” area, the City owns approximately 670 acres of land on both banks. Known locally as the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway, this property serves three important purposes: 
• Protects the Creek as a primary source of potable water for North Port and the 
region; 
• Preserves the flood storage capacity these lands provide;  
• Provides City residents and visitors with a unique recreational opportunity to 
enjoy this resource; and  
• Reduces the possibility of future homes being affected by flood events through 
the purchase of platted lands located within the 100- year floodplain.  
 
Anchoring the Greenway at the northe rn City limits is the 206 -acre Myakkahatchee 
Creek Environmental Park. Managed by the Sarasota County Parks and Recreation 
Department through an interlocal agreement, the park offers bike trails, primitive camping, nature trails, restrooms, wildlife observ ation opportunities , and a picnic area 
with grills. The Park was purchased with the aid of grants obtained from the Florida Recreation Development Assistance Program and the Florida Communities Trust’s (FCT) Preservation 2000 program. 
In 2007, the City received its fourth FCT grant to purchase an additional ±77 acres of 
land with which to widen a segment of the Greenway south of the Environmental Park.                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-19 By City Commission decree, only passive and passive/moderately active recreational 
uses will be permitted.  Amenities and uses in this segment of the Greenway will include a 
fitness/nature trail with interpretive signage, wildlife observation, horseshoe pits, canoeing , and picnic shelters.  
A 3.3- acre portion of the 2007 FCT project site was designated as occupi ed Florida scrub 
jay habitat by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006. 
Other wildlife present in or near the Greenway  include the eastern indigo snake, bald 
eagle, gopher tortoise, great egret, snow y egret, night heron, little blue heron, sandhill 
crane, otter, red-shouldered hawk, osprey, raccoon and bobcat. 
Vegetative communities present in the Greenway  include hydric hammock, forested 
wetland, dry prairie, mesic hammock, scrubby flatwoods and mesic flatwoods. Forests – The Myakka State Forest , compr ised of 8,593 acres, lies entirely within City 
boundaries. Part of the Myakka Conservancy, the Forest is managed by the State Division 
of Forestry. The Southwest Florida Water Management District provided funding to 
purchase half of the Forest and is an im portant co- operator in the management of the 
property, especially regarding hydrological management.  
The Forest’s recreational amenities and uses include biking, boating, camping, canoeing, fishing, hiking, picnicking, wildlife observation and equestrian t rails.  
Approximately 2.5 miles of Myakka River frontage lies within the Forest’s boundaries. The Myakka River has been designated an “Outstanding Florida Water” and a State “Wild and Scenic River.” The Myakkahatchee Creek flows throughout the forest for 1.5 miles and provides an additional water resource.  
Vegetative communities present in the Myakka State Forest include mesic flatwoods with 
a mixture of longleaf pine and slash pine overstory with palmetto understory , pine 
flatwoods, depression and tidal ma rsh, scrub, tidal swamp and prairie  hammock. The 
depression marshes , scattered throughout the flatwoods, provide many opportunities for 
viewing wading birds and other wildlife.  
Timber management practices in the  Myakka State Forest are important to the restoration 
and maintenance of forest ecosystems and provide a variety of socio- economic benefits to 
Floridians. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of 
Forestry, returns 15 percent of the revenue obtained from timber harvest s, recreation, and 
other income -producing services on Myakka State Forest to Sarasota County for 
educational purposes.  
Wildlife species found in the Myakka State Forest include all the species found in or near 
the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway, as well as alligator and other species common to 
southwest Florida. 
Myakka River Basin  – Within the Myakka River Basin, there are 25  public and three  
private boat ramp lanes with public access, located at 12 different sites , which  provide 
access to the Gulf of Mexico  and bays for saltwater fishing and boat ing recreation. One 
of these is located in North Port, and one in Venice.  
                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-20 Known pollution problems  
Myakka River Basin. Since January 1995, ambient water quality in the Myakka River 
has been monitored by a private  contractor. The sampling methodology recommended by 
the Sarasota Bay National Estuary Program is designed to track the progress in improving 
estuarine health by implementing the Program’ s Comprehensive Conservation and 
Management Plan and the Myakka River  Wild and Scenic Management Plan.  
Water quality m onitoring stations are located both north and south of U.S. Highway 41. 
Parameters analyzed include temperature, salinity, specific conductivity, pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, chlorophyll “a,” turbidity, color, 
dissolved oxygen, Secchi disk depths, light attenuation coefficient, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, and biological oxygen demand. Continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen for two days each month is conducted at selected representative sites.  
According to the Florida Department of Environmental P rotection , the majority of the 
Myakka River basin has good water quality which supports productive freshwater and estuarine habitats. Approximately 20 miles of the southern reaches of the River are influenced by tidal flows, as evidenced by the abundance of mangrove swamps and islands. The Myakka River Basin, including the Myakkahatchee Creek in North Port, contains the only Class I surface waters design ated in Sarasota County. 
While the water quality of the Myakka River is rated as good by FDEP, FDEP , in its 
proposed impaired waters list has recently identified several areas of the Myakka River for total nitrogen and one segment impaired for total phosphorus and chlorophyll . The 
City is currently working with FDEP  in addressing these concerns. 
The West Indian  manatee lives in Sarasota County waters , including the southern reaches 
of the Myakkahatchee Creek in North Port, Little Salt Creek near Warm Minera l Springs 
and the Myakka River. Manatees are herbivorous mammals that feed upon seagrasses and fresh water aquatic plants such as water hyacinth. Seagrass habitats are also essential to  
numerous other marine species and should be protect ed and restored where possible. 
Mangroves and tidal marshes are now protected at federal, state and local levels.  
Floodplain. Please see Big Slough / Myakkahatchee Creek, below. Big Slough / Myakkahatchee Creek . Myakkahatchee Creek , a major tributary of the 
Myak ka River , is designated a Class I surface water . It is a major source of potable water 
for the City of North Port. Nutrient loading from agricultural operations mainly north of 
the City , in addition to increased urban development with in the Ci ty, have contributed to 
higher volumes of stormwater runoff, which in turn has affected water quality.  
The Myakkahatchee Creek ’s flow  is highly dependent on rainfall and resulting 
stormwater runoff. Historical data indicates that the Creek’s water quality diminishes 
during dry seasons or periods of low rainfall , when the C reek’s flow is minimal and 
influenced by groundwater. 
At present, Myakkahatchee Creek is not monitored for impairment by FDEP. According 
to the Sarasota County Comprehensive Plan (2016) , the Creek’s  water quality is highly 
variable with a rating of 33 -56 (good- fair).                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-21 In addition, the 2016 update to the City’s FIRM Map series shows numerous other areas 
of the City that are within the 100- year floodplain. While the existence of these areas is 
somewhat of a concern, most of the flood areas are on City streets and serve to sheet flow stormwater into the numerous canals that feed into Myakka Creek.  
 Soil and water.  Please see the discussion above under Soil and Water Erosion. Recreational areas and forests.  Please see discussions above under Myakka River 
Basin  and Big Slough / Myakkahatchee Creek.  
Groundwater.  Please see discussion on groundwater above under Rivers, wetlands, 
estuarine marshes, groundwater and air.  
Current and projected water needs and sourc es 
The City ’s eventual  goal is to serve  all developed residential areas  and the industrial and 
commercial sectors with potable water and sewer , with the exception of the North Port Estates 
and Lake Geraldine areas, which  are intended to remain  agricultural/estates.  Implementation of 
that goal is tied to the City’s policy of extending water and sewer service concurrently.  
1. Industrial – Three industrially zoned areas constitute the entirety of industrial development 
within the City:  
• An area of small, light industrial operations in the Trott Circle are a; 
• The North Port Park of Commerce near Interstate Highway 75 on the west side of Toledo 
Blade Boulevard. The Park of Commerce is home to many larger industrial businesses, 
many serving  regional and national marke ts. Included as part of the Park of Commerce is 
the North Port Industrial Park, an area that allows for larger scale industrial uses than in 
the rest of the Park of Commerce; and  
•  The King Plastics Plant just south and east of the Park of Commerce.  
All thr ee areas receive central water and sewer service from North Port Utilities. The Trott 
Circle area is entirely developed, and only a few undeveloped parcels remain in the Park of Commerce. King Plastics has not announced any plans for expanding its operations. 
In addition, while the northern portion of Bobcat Village Center and a portion of the Panacea 
DRI have the ability for industrial uses to be developed on their lands, with the exception of the Patriot Self -Storage facility in Bobcat Village Center, the re has been no industrial or 
warehouse development on these properties.  
2. Agricultural – A limited number of small- scale (3-acre or less)  agricultural operations exist 
in agriculturally -zoned North Port Estates, located in the northernmost area of the City.  
These operations are served by private wells and septic systems. The City has determined that this area will never receive centralized water and sewer service.
 
                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-22 3. Potable water 
As of 2016, t he North Port Utilities Department provides potable water service to  approximately 
19,000 water connections, both residential and otherwise.  Since acquiring the central water and 
sewer system formerly owned by the now defunct General Development Corporation in 1992, 
the City has completed several system expansion and improvement projects  and serves 
approximately 14,500 customers. 
The City has experienced  rapid growth in recent years, and the City’s Planning and Zoning 
Department projects its population will grow to approximately  93,000 residents  by the year 
2030. Proposed large scale developments in the West Villages other proposed and planned 
developments i n the Kelce Ranch and Panacea areas are anticipated to be focal points of growth 
in the future, while the older platted lots will also continue to be developed. 
Most are as currently served by North Port Utilities are located within or near the old City core 
area or along the City’s artery roadways .  Many  residents  and businesses outside of this core 
currently u se private wells for potable water.  
North Port Utilities has developed a Utilities Master Plan which is updated at five -year intervals. 
One of the primary requirements of the Master Plan is that developers, under the terms of 
Developer’s Agreements executed in concert with the City, must pay all costs associated with  
construction of a water treatment plant, which must then be dedicated to the City. 
Processes identified in the Utilities Master Plan will guide the fulfillment of the two major goals 
identified in previous updates to the Comprehensive Plan: more aggressive expansion of water 
and sewer service throughout the City, and identification of new water sources to support future growth. A City ordinance passed in 2003 requires all homeowners and businesses currently served by private wells to connect to North Port Utilities water service within one year of the 
service becoming available.  While these goals have been in place since 2005, the collapse of the 
local housing market in the late 2000’s served to limit the ability of the City to implement the former goal. In  2016, the City Commission approved an updated version of the City’s Utilities 
Plan. More information on this can be found in the water and sanitary sewer sections of the Utilities element.  
Current water sources  
Potable water currently supplied by the Nor th Port Utilities Department comes from two  primary 
sources:  
1. Finished water supplied by means of an interconnection with the water treatment and 
distribution system owned by the Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply 
Authority  – By the provisions of i ts current contract  with the Authority, the City receives 
1.192 mgd  (average annual daily flow, or AAD F).  
2. The Myakkahatchee Creek  and the Cocoplum Waterway , both  raw water sources – See 
description in Potable Water section of this element  
An intake struc ture will be constructed on the Cocoplum Waterway to take advantage of this 
significant source of raw water.  
As mentioned elsewhere in this Element, the 670- acre Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway, 
acquired by the City over a period of decades and scheduled for expansion, serves as a buffer 
to protect the quality of water in the Creek itself.                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-23 Current status of North Port Utilities’ water treatment and distribution system  – The major 
components of the City’s potable water system are: 
1. Myakkahatchee Creek Water Treatment Plant (MCWTP), including storage facilities  having 
a capacity of  5.4 million gallons  per day (MGD); 
2. Hillsborough Booster Pump Station; 
3. Northeast Booster Pump Station, together with a 1 million -gallon storage facility;  
4. Transmission and distribution pi ping system;  
5. Southwest Booster Pump Station, also having a 1 million- gallon storage facility; and 
6. An interconnection with Charlotte County and Sarasota County water lines . 
7. An interconnection to the Peace River Water System  
8. A 2.5- million -gallon ground stora ge tank for reuse water  
Future demand and water sources  
The Utilities  Department projects future potable water demand on the basis of both projected 
population increase and projected increases in per capita water consumption rates. In the period 
by 20 30, t he average daily demand is expected to be approximately 12.88 mgd. The following 
water sources  will be employed to meet this demand: 
1. Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority – In 2011, water supplied to the 
City by the Authority was increased t o 2.7 mgd  AADF, a supply level that will continue 
throughout the planning period covered by this Comprehensive Plan. Water supplied by the Authority is expected to rise to 3.2 mgd in 2014.  
2. North Port Water Treatment Plant – Plant expansion increased the pl ant’s treatment 
capacity to 4.4 mgd. However, recent regulations will limit its expected production capacity 
to 3.5 mgd. An intake structure on the Cocoplum Waterway will be constructed so that the 
Waterway  may be u sed as a permanent water source, its wate r to be  blended with 
Myakkahatchee Creek water during dry periods.  
3. A Northeast Water Treatment Plant  has been delayed and will be programmed into the 
City’s Capital Improvement Plan when needed and be financially feasible per State Statute.  
The decline of the housing market in the late 2000’s  led to a slackening of development in 
the northeastern section of the City, particularly in the potential development of the Kelce Ranch and Orange Hammock area. With the potential purchase of the Kelce Ranch by the State of Florida, it is unlikely that construction of a North -East Water Treatment Plant will 
take place within the 2017-2027 timeframe.  
4.  A Southwest Water Treatment Plant  to serve the West Villages  area, expected to be 
online by 2019-2020. Depending upon the pace of development, production will be 1.4 mgd 
initially, increasing to 2.8 mgd in 2025. This project has been delayed and will be 
programmed into the City’s Capital Improvement Plan when needed and be financially feasible per State Statute.  
Depen ding upon the City’s growth rate and the need for new treatment facilities, all of the above 
sources together will produce approximately 15.9 mgd.                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-24 In addition to the above sources, a demonstration Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) well 
continues to be evaluated for its potential as a water source for use during the dry winter months. 
Current and future reuse water supply  
Treatment facilities at the North Port Wastewater Treatment Plant are currently permitted to 
produce up to 1.88 mgd  of reuse water on an annual average basis. Reuse water is stored in an 
onsite 500,000-gallon tank.  
The City recently expanded permitted reuse treatment capacity  from 1.88 mgd to 4.4 mgd. 
Ultimately , reuse treatment capacity will increase to 7.0 mgd in conjunction with the expansion 
of the City’s W astewater Treatment Plant and disposal systems. The expansion will include 
construction of a 2.5 million -gallon  reuse storage tank. 
The City recently finalized a Reuse Master Plan , which identified several potential reuse 
customers wh ose total demand could eventually top 21 mgd, As the City of North Port’s 
wastewater flow increases throughout the planning period, additional reuse water will be  
processed and distributed to new and existing North Port Utilities customers. 
Water conservat ion and the Southwest Florida Water Management District  
The City of North Port has benefitted from a long history of cooperation with and support from 
the Southwest Florida  Water  Management District (SWFWMD). This cooperative relationship 
continues throughout the drought that began in 2006. A City ordinance enacted in 1990 requires the City to comply with SWFWMD -imposed water use restrictions in a declared water shortage 
emergency. The City complies with and vigorously enforces mandatory water use restricti ons, 
including once-a-week watering, imposed by the District in 2007. 
The City has enacted year -round water conservation rules that exceed SWFWMD  requirements , 
as well as  an inverted , six-tiered rate structure designed to encourage conservation  by making 
heavy consumers of water pay more per quantity of water . 
Information gleaned from the SWFWMD -funded Floodplain Analysis Report  completed in 2007 
is also expected to provide North Port Utilities with useful information concerning the 
Myakkahatchee Creek as a raw water source.  
The District is also helping the City evaluate the potential of Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) as a means  to capture the increased quantity of surface water available in the 
Myakkahatchee Creek and Cocoplum Waterway in the summer . A pilot ASR well at the North 
Port Water Treatment Plant is currently undergoing cycle testing and laboratory analysis.  
Through the City’s use of conservation programs and reuse water for bulk purchasers the City saves 27 million gallons per month, or 1 million gallons per day.  This water is used primarily for irrigation of golf courses and landscaping.  This allows the City to use less potable water for these water intensive uses.  
 For further details concerning potable water and reuse water, please see the Potable Water  and 
Sanitary Sewer Elements of this Comprehensive Plan.                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-25 COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT  SECTION 
DATA AND ANALYSIS  
 
Inventory of existing land uses in the coastal planning area  
For the purposes of this Element, the City of North Port defines it s coastal planning area as lands 
lying within the Category 1 hurricane storm surge zone depicted on the Southwest Florida 
Regional Planning Council’s Hurricane Storm Tide Atlas for Sarasota County. 
Community background 
The area that became the platted land s community of North Port was originally a conglomeration 
of sloughs that drained into Charlotte Harbor. This n atural reg ime was altered significantly 
beginning in the 1950s, when General Development Corporation began dredging a drainage 
system that today totals some 378 miles in length, including 84 miles of major waterways and 
294 miles of drainage ways. These dredging activities, together with the creation of a network of public roads totaling 814 miles, all but eliminated most of the sloughs.  
The City  of North Port is predominantly residential in nature , with most non- residential 
development confined to  unplatted areas call ed Activity Centers. The current population  is just 
over 64,400 residents . It is anticipated that under the current Future Land Use Map, including 
platted lots, and approved developments, the City’s population has the potential to house over 270,000 residents.   
Shoreline uses  
No shoreline conflicts occur or are planned for development in the coastal planning area. 
Approximately 7.5 miles of the Myakkahatchee Creek north of the U.S. Highway 41 bridge i s 
protected and buffered by the Recreation/Open Space- designated lands of the Myakkahatchee 
Creek Greenway. South of the bridge in a residentially -zoned, built -out subdivision, homes with 
seawalls or rock revetment line both banks of the Creek for approximately a mile. Southward of 
this residential area, the Creek enters the State- owned Conservation area known as the Myakka 
State Forest. No further development is anticipated on either the Cr eek or the River.  
The owners of the formerly proposed River Road O ffice Park (Activity Center #8)  purchased 
land on the Myakka River for a private passive park. This property is designated for Conservation use. 
Need for water- dependent and water -related development sites  
The City of North Port has one limited public marina, Marina Park on Chancellor Boulevar d. 
This site  has ample parking and provides boaters with access to the Myakka River and  Charlotte 
Harbor. The extension of the local option infrastructure surtax from 2010 through 2024 will 
provide an estimated $3,150,000 for c onstruction of watercraft launches, docks and ramps for 
non-motorized access to City canals . 
In an application to the Florida Communities Trust Florida Forever program that resulted  in the 
awarding of a $2.8 million land acquisition grant in 2007, the City proposed the construction of a public observation platform in the freshwater portion of the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway.                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-26 Construction of this amenity will follow the planned acquisition of another 70± acres of land to 
expand the Greenway.  
Over the last several years, the City has developed a Blueway s plan for its canals and waterways. 
As part of the implementation of this plan, several canoe launches and portage facilities have been installed along the Blue Ridge and Cocoplum waterways and along Myakkahatchee Creek additional facilities will be constructed in future phases. More information about the Blueway s 
plan can be found as part of the Parks and Recreation Element.   
Because t he subdivision south of the U.S. 41 bridge is entirely developed, no opportunities exist 
for the development of water -related sites  along the brackish water portion of the Creek. South 
and west of this subdivision lies the State -owned Myakka State Forest.  
Areas in need of redevelopment  
At present, no areas associated with either the Myakkahatchee Creek or the Myakka River are in 
need of redevelopment.,  
The City has attempted to establish a Community Redevelopment Area on U.S. Highway 41, but 
Sarasota County did not approve formal designation of this district. The City has a Master Plan to guide development in that area, even without the CRA.  
Economic base of coastal planning area 
The Future Land Use Element does not reference the economic base of the coastal planning area, 
which the City has defined as the areas surrounding the Myakka River and the Myakkahatchee Creek.  
The Element does state that, “Continued development of these [Myakkahatchee Creek] lots beyond current levels would negatively impact the potable water, environmental, and floodplain 
function [of] the Creek. ” The City, through land acquisition, has been very successful in 
assembling land to protect the Creek  while eliminating the potential for the flooding of future 
residences that may have been developed on the platted lots, and has also cooperated with the 
Division of Forestry regarding administration of the Myakka State Forest, which borders the River for approximately three miles.  
The conservation lands associated with the Myakkahatchee Cr eek Greenway and the Myakka 
State Forest do have limited eco -tourism potential, but neither figures at all prominently in the 
City’s economic base.  
The City of North Port is primarily a residential community. Activity Center #1, containing the oldest resid ential subdivisions and the City’s original downtown commercial area, is the Activity 
Center nearest the coastal planning area.  
Effects of future land uses on natural resources in the coastal planning area  
A mixture of homes and some commercial uses are planned for the West Villages  property 
located in the southwest corner of the City. Maximum buildout density has been limited to 16,000 residential units. The majority of anticipated development will be approximately 2.5 miles from the coastal zone along the  Myakka River. A section of the development of the West 
Villages (Village B) is located within the 100 year floodplain while other portions of the property would be vulnerable to a 2 meter rise in sea level. The City recognizes and intends to                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-27 work with the  developer to minimize the effects of proposed development, particularly runoff  
and the potential flooding issues that may occur within the residential areas . However, the effects 
of this development on the coastal zone, as defined in Florida statutes, are  anticipated  to be 
minimal.   The area along the Myakka River will be developed to be consistent with the Myakka 
River Wild and Scenic Designation Act, the Myakka River Wild and Scenic Management Plan, 
and the future ordinances the City will be adopting reg arding the Wild and Scenic Protection 
Zone. 
Vegetative cover, wetlands and wildlife habitats  
Vegetative cover, wetlands and wildlife habitats within the Myakka State Forest are managed in 
accordance with conservation best management practices by the State Division of Forestry. 
Myakka State Forest is made up primarily of mesic flatwoods with a mixture of longleaf pine and slash pine overstory with a palmetto understory. Numerous depression marshes are scattered throughout the flatwoods, providing many opportunities for viewing wading birds and other wildlife.  The forest includes approximately 2.5 miles of frontage on the Myakka River , which is 
designated as an Outstanding Florida Water and a State Wild and Scenic River. Myakkahatchee 
Creek flows throughout the forest for 1.5 miles and provides an additional water resource. 
The City is a voting member of  the Myakka River Management Coordinating Council , and 
recently signed a ‘ State -Local Agreement  for Administering the Myakka River Wild and Scenic 
River Protect ion Zone Between the Florida Department of Protection, the Florida Department of 
Community Affairs, and the City of North Port.’ Residential development will continue in the subdivisions surrounding the Myakkahatchee 
Creek. However, for 30 years the City h as conscientiously been implementing a land acquisition 
program to protect the Creek and its Class I waters from the U.S. 41 bridge to the northern City limits. (For approximately one- mile south of the bridge, the Creek passes through built -out 
residential  subdivisions.) 
The Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway acquisition phase that took place subsequent to the previous Comprehensive Plan update was financially supported by a $2.8 million Florida Communities Trust grant and matching City funds in an equal amount. These funds were used to 
double the width (800- 900+ feet after acquisition) of the narrowest, 2.8- mile-long stretch of the  
Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway. The City intends to remove, and later restore to near -natural 
conditions, the roadways immediately para lleling the Creek in this area. Following restoration, 
these former roadways will add approximately 15.5 acres to the Greenway. 
Best management practices will be followed to protect resources within the Greenway, as 
expressed in the adopted Myakkahatchee C reek Greenway Master Plan. The City is also 
obligated to implement specific management practices outlined in its 2007 Florida Communities Trust grant contract. 
As noted in this Element and elsewhere in the City’s Comprehensive Plan, the City will continue  
to coordinate efforts with the United S tates Fish and W ildlife Service,  the Florida Fish and 
Wildlife Conservation Commission , the Florida D epartment of Environmental P rotection, the 
Division of Forestry  and other appropriate agencies to  minimize negative impacts to manatees 
that are found in the Myakka R iver and its estuaries , the extreme southern waters of the 
Myakkahatchee Creek within the City, and Little Salt Creek in the Warm Mineral Springs area.                                                                          Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-28 A bird rookery , that includes nesting wood storks, is established on an island in the Myakka 
River adjacent to  the City’s coastal zone. The C ity will coordinate with the above -named 
agencies to identify any additional rookeries that may become established, and will fully 
cooperate with these agencies regardi ng situations that could affect wildlife and wildlife habitat.   
Agency cooperation is vital when one considers the wealth of wildlife and habitat in this area, as is evidenced on the ‘Biodiversity Hot Spots Map’ found at the end of this element. 
Living mar ine resources  
Primarily in the winter  months, manatees are commonly seen in the southernmost waters of the 
Myakkahatchee Creek just before it flows into Charlotte County and Sarasota County. A prime observation area is Marina Park on Chancellor Boulevard. The Park is at the southern end of built-out subdivisions bordering the Creek. Manatees also frequent the waters of Little Salt Creek between  Warm Mineral Springs  and the Myakka River. The City has no plans to develop 
additional public access points for boaters in this area.  
Sarasota County’s Manatee Protection Program encompasses the southern half of the Town of Longboat Key, the City of Sarasota, the City of Venice, but only a small portion of the City of North Port along the Myakka River and Salt Creek , as identified in the County’s latest Manatee 
Protection Plan (approved in 2011).  
Inventory and analysis of impacts of development and proposed 
redevelopment in the Future Land Use Element  
The City did attempt to implement a Community Redevelopment Area th at would also have 
provided tax increment financing for the implementation of the U.S. 41 Corridor Master Plan. However, Sarasota County would not approve creation of the proposed CRA. The City does intend to implement the Master Plan, which includes the a rea where U.S. 41 crosses the 
Myakkahatchee Creek . 
To the north of the bridge, very limited passive and active/passive amenities will be developed in the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway. These amenities include picnic pavilions, horseshoe pits, a playground with restrooms and an observation deck. 
As discussed above, existing residential development in built -out subdivisions abuts the Creek 
south of U.S. 41. 
Historic resources and sites  
Two archaeological sites , together identified by the State as 8SO1308, exis t within the City’s 
coastal planning area (Category 1 SLOSH zone). Designated  familiarly as “ Jeff's Clam Midden ,” 
the site is  comprised of two prehistoric shell middens that are recorded as being eligible for 
placement on the National Register of Historic Places.  The site is located on State -owned 
preservation land very near the Myakka River.                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-29 Inve ntory and analysis of estuarine pollution conditions and actions needed to 
maintain estuaries  
The Myakka River watershed receives special protection. The 34- mile segment of the Myakka 
River in Sarasota County was designated as a State Wild and Scenic River and an Outstanding 
Florida Water. Approximately 2.75 miles of the River flows through North Port, most of it 
border ed on both banks by the Myakka State Forest. 
The River flows into Charlotte Harbor, a SWFWMD Surface Water Improvement and 
Management (SWIM) water body. The Myakka River Basin is subject to study and management though this program. As mentioned previously, the City is a voting member of  the Myakka Riv er 
Management Coordinating Council. The City has signed the State -Local Agreement to 
administer  the Myakka River Wild and Scenic Protection Zone. 
The segment of the Myakkahatchee Creek within City boundaries and the Myakka River are 
Class I water bodies and are thereby protected as drinking water sources. North Port has created a natural, 670 -acre protective buffer surrounding the Creek. Part of the river estuary is protected 
for shellfish harvesting. 
In June 2014, Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL’s)  for the  three waterbodies that overlap 
with North Port were proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Of the three 
waterbodies TMDL, one was approved also be FDEP.  The TMDL’s address impairments of fecal chloroforms, total nitrates and total phosphorus.  The City has proposed prioritization and time line shown in Exhibit “TMDL"" for addressing the TMDL’s which is acceptable to FDEP. 
Like the unincorporated area of Sarasota County bordering the City on the north and west, 
portions of the City of North Port contribute to pollution that affects estuaries downstream of the City, and the problem will grow with future development. As a collector of runoff from a large portion of the City, Myakkahatchee Creek convey s some pollutants to the estuarine area 
surrounding the Myakka River.  
Of great concern to the City is the quantity of pollutants that reach the Creek from the overuse of 
nitrogen- based fertilizers.  In 2007, the City Commission passed a restrictive new fertilizer 
ordinance (Ordinance No. 07- 45) that  promises to reduce the amount of nitrogen and 
phosphorous reaching the River estuaries. Under the ordinance, no fertilizer containing either 
chemical can be applied to lawns from June 1 through September 30. Among other provisions, it also creates a 10 -foot-wide “fertilizer free zone” around ponds, streams, canals and the top of 
seawalls. No fertilizer may be applied within a wetland, or within 25 feet of a wetland, or within the flow channel of swales. All commercial and institutional applicators of fertilizer must receive training and certification in a City -approved program provided by the Sarasota County Extension 
Service.  
Because the City has created a buffer called the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway, upstream runoff is to a large degree naturally attenuated. The importance of the Greenway as a natural filtering agent cannot be underestimated, since the Creek it protects is the primary drainage feature for the entire City. Fortunately, the subdivisions south of the U.S. 41 bridge along the Creek reached b uild-out years ago, and no additional development can therefore occur that might 
exacerbate pollution.  
Unfortunately, the original developer of the City, General Development Corporation, went bankrupt, leaving the City with an incomplete central water and sewer system. Consequently,                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-30 many North Port homes are served by septic systems. Beginning in 2007 and continuing into 
2008, the North Port Utilities Department began earnest discussions with the City Commission and administration about a coordinated plan t o address this challenge.  
A Neighborhood Improvements Master Plan will be developed in 2008 to evaluate those areas not currently receiving utility service. The plan will contain procedures to identify and prioritize neighborhoods according to need. The plan will focus on financial feasibility. The City requires owners of homes in existing neighborhoods to connect to the City of North Port water and sewer system within one year after service is available.  
Preliminary estimates indicate the implementation o f the Neighborhood Improvements  project 
may cost over $1.8 billion. The voter -approved third extension of the local option surtax 
provides almost $25 million in future funding for expansion of water and sewer distribution and collection systems.   Another $10 million for transmission mains and associated infrastructure 
will be generated by capacity fees on all new construction.   Other funding to complete this 
project will include assessments and potential grant funding. 
The City’s Stormwater Man ager reports that n o point sources of pollution exist that might affect 
Myakkahatchee Creek and, ultimately, the Myakka River . 
Assessment of impacts of facilities proposed in other elements:  
Traffic Circulation   
No new roads are proposed for construction in the City’s coastal zone.  
Sanitary Sewer  
With the planned expansion of the City’s Wastewater Treatment Plant, a  second  deep -
injection well will be built on the same property as the existing Deep Injection Well. That 
property is located outside of North Port’s High Hazard Zone (i.e., the SLOSH/Hurricane 
Category 1 Zone).  The initial well is approximately 3,200 feet deep. 
Solid Waste  
No structural facilities for disposal of solid waste are planned for construction within the 
coastal zone.  
Drainage 
A 2003 study of the Big Slough Watershed, which encompasses all of the City of North 
Port, was completed in September 2014 under a cooperative funding agreement between 
the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) and t he City. The Big 
Slough hydraulic model was us ed to evaluate best management practices (BMP’s) 
alternatives analysis to achieve flood protection, while ensuring no adverse impact.  The 
following BMP alternatives were evaluated:  
1. Remove Water Control Structures (WCS) throughout City of North Port waterw ays-all 69 of the City’s WMS and drop structures (DS) 
were removed to evaluate the flood impacts.                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-31 2. Constrain flow entering the City of North Port at Big Slough Canal – 
On the northwest City boundary, at the intersection of Big Slough canal with R -36 and R -580 waterways, all existing earthen weirs were 
raised to limit runoff from offsite areas, leaving the Big Slough canal as the only conveyance system into the western portion of the City. 
3. Diversion Alternative -flows from offsite areas were diverted via the 
existing R -36 canal, by increasing its capacity and improvising its 
hydraulic connectivity with Deer Prairie Slough canal. 
4. R-580 Improvements – introduce additional flows through Creighton 
waterway by improving current conveyance capacity in the R -580 
water way.  
5. Increase capacity on southern boundary – all structures  discharging 
from Cocoplum W aterway into the Charlotte Harbor area under 
Hillsborough Blvd and their upstream weirs were doubled in capacity. 
6. Upstream detention alternative – evaluate construction  of stormwater 
management storage areas north of the City to detain water from entering the City during a storm event.  
7. Increasing the flow capacity at four crossings – evaluated  the doubling 
in flow capacity at the R -36 Canal at I -75, Myakkahatchee Creek at I -
75, R -36 Canal at Tropicaire Boulevard, and Myakkahatchee Creek at 
Tropicaire Blvd.  
8. Evaluate additional gates at WCS No. 162 on the R -36 Canal -this is 
the only gated weir structure on the R -36 canal and additional ga tes 
were added to draw down the cana l more quickly and increase 
conveyance capacity.  
9. Reduce roadway flooding on Pri ce Boulevard west of the  
Myakkahatchee Creek -evaluate the modifications which included 
combinations of dredging of an adjacent R -ditch that accepts water 
from the roadway, increasing the connecting pipe capacity and/or raising Price Boulevard roadway out of the floodplain. 
All BMP alternatives evaluated except No. 6 and 9 showed reduced flooding in some areas but increased flooding in other areas.  The City has proposed in Fiscal  Year 2016 to 2017, another 
study to evaluate additional regional and localized  flood reduction projects.  Of the $300,000 
budgeted for this study, the City will be receiving up to $125,000 reimbursement from SWFMWD through an approved Cooperative Funding Initiative grant for reduction of localized 
flooding. l.  
 
Potable Water  
No potable water facilities are planned for construction within the coastal planning ar ea. A water 
treatment plant and storage tank to serve the West Villages Improvement District is planned for 
construction west of the planning area by 2020.                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-32 Natural Groundwater Aquifer Recharge  
A groundwater supply feasibility study is planned in conjunction with the proposed construction 
of the West Villages water treatment plant.  
Further engineering,  hydrogeological and laboratory testing will continue in Phase V of the 
City’s existing Aquifer Storage and Recovery well demonstration project . 
 
Actions needed to remed y existing pollution problems 
The following actions, as well as those discussed above, will do much to remedy existing 
pollution problems: 
1. Continuation of land acquisition to enlarge the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway from its 
current 670 acres to 740 acres -plus will increase natural attenuation of pollutants that 
might otherwise reach the Cre ek and, eventually, the coastal zone and estuaries. 
2. Vigorous enforcement of City Ordinance No. 07 -45, which restricts the use of fertilizer, 
particularly near water bodies.  
3. No above -ground City infrastructure of any type is part of the City’s Capital 
Impro vement Program.  
4. Continued enforcement of  those portions of the City’s Unified Land Development Code 
(as amended) relating to Dredge and Fill Regulations (Chapter 13), Earthmoving Activities (Chapter 14), Flood Damage Prevention Regulations (Chapter 17), Landscaping Regulations (Chapter 21), Site and Development Plan Regulations  (Chapter 
33), Subdivision Regulations (Chapter 37), Transfer of Development Rights (Chapter 41), Wetlands Protection Regulations (Chapter 49) and Zoning Regulations (Chapter 53). 
5. Expansion of central sewer service to existing neighborhoods. 
6. Continued cooperation with the Myakka River Management Coordinati ng Council. 
7. Continued cooperation with the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program and the goals 
of the Myakka Wild and Scenic River  Management Plan. 
8. Continued cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
9. Continued cooperation with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 
10. Continued sharing of information and participation with the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council. 
11. Continued cooperation with regulatory actions promulgated by the Southwest Florida 
Water Management District.  
12. Encourage all new developments to incorporate low impact development concepts such 
as reuse of stormwater for irrigation, use of pervious pavement, reduction of impervious areas, bioretention/biotreatment swales, green roofs, rain cisterns to reduce pollution discharge.

 5-33 Natural disaster planning concerns  
Although the whole of Sarasota County has been designated a coastal zone County b y the 
Department of Economic Opportunity, the City of North Port lies approximately 10 to 15 miles  
inland from the Gulf of Mexico.   
The City does, however, share some of the characteristics of a coastal zone area because i t is 
connected to the Gulf coast via the Myakkahatchee Creek and the Myakka River. For the 
purposes of this analysis and per Florida Statute, the City of North Port defines its “coastal planning area” as that portion of the City within the “Category 1” zone shown on the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council’s SLOSH “Hurricane Storm Tide Atlas” for landfalling 
storms affecting Sarasota County.  
Excluding the West Villages  annexed area, m ost of the City (approximately 60 percent) lies 
north of and outside of all storm category SLOSH zones. In the most densely populated portion of the City, about 30 percent lies in Category 4/5 and 5 to 10 percent in Category 3.  
Only a small area south of U .S. Highway 41 near the Charlotte County line, including older  
neighborhoods near Biscayne  and Pan American  Boulevards and Sydney Avenue, lie within the 
Category 2 zone . Most of the Duck Key subdivision (south of U.S. 41 near the Myakkahatchee 
Creek) lies in Category 2, with portions of one or two local roads in Catego ry 1. 
Holiday Park, a manufactured housing subdivision containing 865 units, is in Category 2. 
About 70 percent of the 8,500- acre State- managed Myakka State Forest is within the Category 3 
zone, while the remainder of the Forest near the Myakka River is within the Category 2 and 1 
zones. 
West of the Myakka River in the West Villages  annexed area, the Gran Paradiso development 
south of U.S. 41 lies within SLOSH Category 3 and Category 4/5. This development will have 
approximately 2 ,000 units at buildout. 
Most of Thomas Ranch itself, including the residential areas of the West Villages Improvement 
District, is within the Category 3 and 4/5 zones. About one -quarter of the Ranch east of and 
along River Road lies within the Category 1 and 2 hurricane zones, as we ll as the FEMA/FIRM 
100-year floodplain. While this area is proposed for development as part of Village B, the 
development will be constructed to Florida Building Code standards and will be required to provide stormwater capacity and side design features t hat will take the properties outside of the 
100-year floodplain. Areas within the ranch designated for Conservation use total almost three -
quarters of a square mile.  
The commercial -zoned Town Center of West Villages  lies primarily within Categories 2 and 3 , 
except for a small portion in Category 1. The privately -owned, yet to be developed River Road 
Office Park is within the Category 1 and 2 zones  near the Myakka River. The City will be 
carefully evaluating the effects tropical storms , hurricanes , and sea level rise may have on these 
areas.  
Future proposed development along and east of River Road w ill require close scrutiny by the 
City to ensure that development takes place in a way that does not create a flood hazard . 
The Myakkahatchee Creek area  – The southern reaches of the Myakkahatchee Creek are 
within Category 2 and, to a much lesser  extent, Category 1. However, the Creek serves as a                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-34 SLOSH conduit for Gulf of Mexico storms making landfall in the immediate area, extending 
narrow projections of the Category 3 and Category 4/5 zones northward. 
The majority of residential development adjacent to the Myakkahatchee Creek lies south of the 
U.S. Highway 41 bridge, paralleling the Creek for a distance of one mile. A concern in this area 
is that the  
North of the bridge along both banks of the Creek and extending all the way to the City’s 
northern boundary (a distance of about seven miles), the City has acquired Recreation/Open 
Space- designated lands totaling some 670 acres to serve as a protective natural buffer and natural 
floodwater storage area.  
Considered as a whole, most of the City’s waterfront land that would be directly affected by wave action from storm events is designated for Conservation use, such as the Myakka State Forest .
 
Natural disaster evacu ation planning concerns  
The Hurricane Vulnerability Zone 
The hurricane vulnerability zone for the City of North Port includes four storm category zones 
depicted on the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council’s SLOSH/“Hurricane Storm Tide Atlas” for lan dfalling storms affecting Sarasota County: Category 1, Category 2, Category 3 and 
Category 4/5. No portions of the City lie within the Tropical Storm zone. 
Number of persons requiring evacuation and Number of persons requiring public 
hurricane shelter  
Acco rding to the currently available edition of the Southwest Florida Regional Planning 
Council’s Hurricane Evacuation Study Update (2010), the City of North Port lies in five evacuation zones and portions of 10 others. It is impossible to calculate or estimate the number of North Port residents who reside within those zones shared with other jurisdictions. Table 5-3 
on the following page is adapted from the Study Update. 
Based on Regional Planning Council surveys conducted in 1979, 1981 and 1987, 24 percent of  
survey respondents reported they would use public shelters. Based on the responses to the 
survey, t he “Persons requiring public shelter”  columns of Table 5-3 include estimates  of the 
number of persons in each storm zone who would use publi c shelters  in the month of July and 
the month of October. However, as the study says, survey results do not necessarily predict 
actual behavior.                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element

 5-37 Evacuation Routes; transportation and hazard constraints on evacuation times 
The City’s two main evacuation routes  to Interstate 75 , Sumter Boulevard and Toledo Blade 
Boulevard, have recently been  improved. 
Toledo Blade Boulevard  from U.S. 41 to I -75 is has been  widened from two lanes to four lanes, 
which has greatly improve d evacuation time s. 
Sumter Boulevard  has also recently been widened to four lanes from US 41 to Interstate 75. 
A third evacu ation route for North Port communities we st of the Myakka River is River Road  in 
unincorporated Sarasota County that is mainly outside the City’s jurisdiction. The County is 
identifying funding for a design to widen River Road from two to four lanes, and t he West 
Villages Improvement District may contribute to the design study. Development of West 
Villages is limited to a maximum at 24,000 units, with approximately 5,598 units in three 
villages  (Island Walk, Gran Paradiso, and Renaissance)  either built, under construction, or have 
been approved for development .  The future development of the West Villages will significantly 
affect evacuation times on River Road, which presently is a two -lane road with limited capacity 
that also serves as an evacuation route for East Venice, Englewood and other Charlotte County communities.  
As West Villages  is developed, some of the roads listed in Table 5-6 on the following page will 
be linked. Pine Street will be extended through the development to link with the existing sec tion 
in Englewood. West Villages Parkway will extend northward from Winchester Boulevard, 
eventually linking with River Road north of U.S. Highway 41. Manasota Beach Road will be extended east into West Villages to River Road, which should help to move eva cuation traffic 
more quickly to River Road and I -75. Keyway Road will also be extended from SR 776 to River 
Road through the West Villages.  
The State, and particularly the southwestern region of Florida that includes North Port, 
experienced a surge in population growth throughout the 1990s and in the first decade of the 21st century. The level of service of Interstate 75  has perceptibly and significantly declined along 
with this growth. Consequently, the ability of I -75 to handle a mass or even a partial e vacuation 
has been called into question, even after completion of the widening projects that are ongoing . 
The Transportation Element contains two policies to enhance potential future hurricane 
evacuation routes  through road linkages: 
Policy 4.5:  In order to create another hurricane evacuation route, this policy supports federal, 
state, or regionally funded initiatives to extend Toledo Blade/Choctaw Boulevard northward to intersect with State Road 72. 
Policy 4.6:  In order to further enhance hurricane evacuat ion route, this policy supports federal, 
state, or regionally funded initiatives to create a link between an extended Toledo Blade/Choctaw Boulevard or other North Port roadways and State Road 35 (US 17) in Charlotte  and/or De Soto 
County.                                                                       Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element

notes that, “The worst route (i.e., most limited capacity) is the determining factor [for evacuation time].”  
Further, says the Study Update, “…Some routes end up being ultimate constricting points for more than one zone. That being the case, it may be expected that these times will become 
cumulative. This creates a ‘greatest time to clear’ for the County as a whole.” The SWFRPC study identifies only two such routes for all of Sarasota County. Most significantly for North Port, one of the two is South River Road in the event of a landfalling Category 3 or 4/5 storm. Below are the SWFRPC’s clearance time estimates in hours for South River Road:

 5-41 Projected impact of anticipated populat ion density proposed in the Future Land Use 
Element.  
It is anticipated that, under the current Future Land Use Map, including platted lots, and 
approved developments, the City’s population has the potential to be over 270,000 residents. Since 2000, the City’s population has nearly tripled , with most of the growth coming in the years 
before the 2007-2009 recession.  The storm zones shown on the SLOSH Map (Sea, Lake and Overland Surge from Hurricanes) issued by the SWFRPC indicate that the majority of the Cit y’s land area lies in Category 3, while 
most of the currently populated and future populous areas are within, or even beyond, the Category 4/5 zone.  According to current planning estimates, f uture growth in North Port will occur predominantly in 
new developments with their own commercial areas  (such as the West Villages) , as opposed to 
piecemeal development of platted lots. Policy 13.1 (l) in t he Future Land Use Element  states  that 
civic structures, schools, clubhouses and other structures should be designed to serve as hurricane shelters, thereby providing safe refuge for residents or employees. 
As discussed elsewhere in this Element and the Future Land Use Element, the City has taken the approach of acquiring property along the Myakkahatchee Creek in orde r to preserve natural 
floodwater storage capacity and keep development out of the floodplain. With future planned acquisitions, the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway should increase from its current 670 acres to approximately 750 acres. 
About 75 percent of the West Villages  west of the Myakka River is within the Category 3 and 
4/5 zones, the remainder lying within the Category 1 and 2 hurricane zones. The City will take 
extra care when reviewing any developments proposed for the latter two zones near the River.  
The City will gain an important, updated planning tool with the anticipated completion of the Big Slough Watershed study in late 2008/early 2009. The Southwest Florida Water Management District is finalizing the updated 100- year floodplain maps, which indi cate that a larger portion 
of the City lies within the floodplain than is shown on the incomplete FEMA FIRM maps of 1981. 
The most troubling aspect of future growth within North Port as well as the unincorporated area 
of Sarasota County that surrounds the City is the further strain that will be placed on evacuation routes, particularly on County -maintained River Road and Interstate Highway 75. While the City 
has complete d the four -laning of Sumter Boulevard and Toledo Blade Boulevard, the City 
continues to lack an alternative route to Interstate 75 for hurricane evacuation.  
Special needs of the elderly, handicapped, hospitalized or special needs people 
Sarasota County reports that as of the first quarter of 2015, 2,880 People with Special Needs 
(PSNs) and 1,800 caregivers are registered in the County, and there is sufficient shelter space to 
house all of them. Registered PSNs in North Port currently number approximately 270. While 
the pace of population growth has slowed considerably in North Port during the  recession , the 
renewed growth of the City will inevitably  mean a larger population of PSNs.                                                                         Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-42 With renewed growth, the Sarasota County School District will again accelerate the pace of 
school construction in the City, including construction of the City’s second high school. 
Undoubtedly all of these new facilities will be hardened to serve as public shelters. 
North Port does not have a hospital within its own borders, and currently patients must be 
transported to the neighboring communities of Venice and Por t Charlotte  or to Sarasota (via 
medivac service)  to receive advanced care.  
 Since the completion of the last Comprehensive Plan, Sarasota Memorial Hospital has opened North Port Sarasota Memorial Health Care Center  on Toledo Blade Boulevard. The 
freestandi ng emergency/trauma facility consists of 18 treatment rooms, a 24- hour observation 
unit and specialized rooms for trauma, psychiatric care and obstetrics. The Care Center offer s 
urgent/routine walk- in care and comprehensive outpatient services, including r ehabilitation, 
home health, laboratory, onsite physicians’ services and imaging services.  
The 125,000 square -foot health care facility offer s North Port residents, including PSNs, the 
ability to receive trauma and emergency care much more quickly than has before been possible.  
The SMH facility complements services offered by the North Port Health Park , a 33,000-
square- foot ambulatory care facility . Located on U.S. Highway 41 in North Port, the Health Park 
provides diagnostic and radiology services and laboratory capabilities . 
Potential measures to maintain or reduce hurricane evacuation times  
In addition to road capacity improvements either needed or already underway, the following might be considered by the City in order to maintain or reduce hurricane eva cuation times: 
• Evacuation notices should go out to the public as early as possible, and the public should 
be advised to evacuate when called upon to do so.  
• Increase usage of modern electronic notification methods, such as the City’s website and its automated telephone notification system.  
• There is evidence to suggest that many people who would qualify as People with Special Needs have failed to register for the program. The City should consider promoting the 
program more aggressively, and whenever opportunities exist in conjunction with community outreach programs. 
• When Fire Rescue vehicles are fully occupied transporting PSNs, the City might turn to 
private ambulance services to assist with evacuating the more seriously ill or bedridden.  
• Those without transportation of their own might be qualified as PSNs on that basis alone, 
even though they are not medically qualified. Members of the general population who are transportation- dependent could be encouraged to go to a bus stop, where they would be 
picked up and moved to a transfer point, where other buses would take them to general 
population shelters. 
• The County is developing a plan for mobile home parks and coastal communities 
whereby a small public transit bus would be dispatched to a central point in a community, 
such as a clubhouse. Transportation- dependent residents would be instructed to go to that 
central point and board a bus, which would either take them to a transfer point and then to another bus for transportation to a shelter, or directly to a general population shelter.                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-43 • Promote carpooling to allow additional individuals to evacuate safely. 
• Four- lane Price Boulevard, a major east -west arterial in the City, to  more efficiently 
move people from their neighborhoods, onto Price Boulevard and then to a  designated 
evacuation route more quickly.  
• The I -75 “Contra -Flow” plan, in which the southbound lanes of I -75 would also be used 
for northward evacuation. This plan may only be ordered by the G overnor. For the North 
Port area, the Contra- flow traffic plan  would start at Toledo Blade Boulevard. 
• Consider requiring developers to construct hurricane -resistant clubhouses as shelters for 
the residents of their new developments. 
• Consider reducing the intensity and density of development within the most vulnerable  
Hurricane zones.  
Coastal high hazard area and infrastructure located within it  
As mentioned elsewhere in this Element, the City of North Port’s coastal high hazard area is the 
SLOSH Category 1 zone. 
Some local roads in the Duck Key subdivision located near the Myakkahatchee Creek south of 
U.S. 41 are within the Category 2 SLOSH zone. One or two Duck Key roads appear to be within Category 1.  
The City’s Deep Injection Well is located in the Category 2 zone. The  3,200- foot deep well is 
used to dispose of treated effluent. Above -ground infrastructure as sociated with the well and 
wellhead is minimal.  With the planned expansion of the City’s Wastewater  Treatment Plant, a 
second Deep -Injection Well will be constructed on the same property. 
Apart from these facilities, the City has no above -ground infrastructure in either the Category 1 
or the Category 2 zone at present . However,  the future location of proposed sewer and water 
infrastructure facilities in the West Villages would be located within the Category 2 and 3 flood zones.  
Nor has the City yet experienced repetitive loss of any structures. However, Policy 2.1 of the 
Capital Improvements Element states as follows:  
“The City shall promote the relocation of repeatedly flood damaged structures in FEMA ""A"" Zones as indicated on the existing Flood Insurance Rate Maps  or revised floodplain 
map(s) as adopted by the City Commission consistent with FEMA and /or SWFWMD requirements, and in category 1 SLOSH zones, to safe locations.” 
Beach and dune systems  – The City of North Port has no beaches or dune systems. 
Public access facilities  
Shoreline access points  
Due to the presence of water control and intake structures near the North Port Water Treatment 
Plant on the Myakkahatchee Creek, currently available direct public access to the Myakka River, Charlotte Harbor  and the Gulf of Mexico is limited to one facility, Marina Park on Chancellor                                                                        Conservation & Coastal Zone Management Element  
 5-44 Boulevard. The facility has a parking lot. Other than Marina Park, no boat ramps, public docks or 
commercial marinas or fishing piers with access to these water bodies exist within the City.  
Scenic overlooks  
A scenic view of the Myakka River just north of the City is afforded by the U.S. Highway 41 bridge across the River. The Myakka State Forest has several hiking trails that lead to sc enic 
areas along the River.  
 
Sea Level Rise  
 
While the City of North Port is located within a coastal county, because of the City’s location inland from the Gulf Coast and Charlotte Harbor, based on  the US Geological Survey’s Coastal 
Change Hazards Portal,  only a small section of the City located within the Myakka State Forest 
would be vulnerable to Sea Level Rise  impacts in the near -term.  However, if the sea level rises 
more than 4 feet above where it is currently, portions of the City, including parts of  the West 
Villages and Lake Geraldine would be vulnerable to frequent flooding. While there are other areas of the city that may have high -water issues, most of the areas  are within existing canals or 
locations where development is not possible.

 6-3 RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT 
Introduction  
The management of City -owned parks, recreational amenities and open space has undergone 
significant change since the 1997 update of the City of North Port’s Comprehensive Plan. 
In 1997, the population of North Port was 16,708. B y 2016, the City’s population had more than 
tripled to  over 64,400 residents (B ureau of E conomic and B usiness Research  estimate) . The City’s 
explosive growth within that period of time is attributable to the large numbers of young families 
who moved to the City because of its affordable housing and good schools. As a consequence of this continuing trend, the average age  of a North Port resident has fallen from the early 60’s to the 
early 40’s . However, with the aging of the Baby Boomer generation and the development of the 
West Villages that has, thus far, largely attracted retirees, the median age of City residents has started to increase once again.  Additionally, similar to  many areas of the US and Florida and 
owing to the City’s combined affordability and quality of life, North Port has become more diverse over the last 20 years, with the Hispanic population of the City nearly tripling and the Asian -
American population nearly doubling  between 2000 and 2010, according to the US Census Bureau.  
Under the terms of the City’s 1993 Interlocal Agreement with Sarasota County Government, the City’s recreational programs, activities and facilities had been consolidated and placed under the direction of the County. But in June 2006, the two governments, recognizing the changing demographics and the growing recreational needs of the citizens of both the City and County, executed a new Interlocal Agreement that transferred management of a majority of City  parks from 
the County to the City.  
Under the 2006 Agreement, management of  a majority  of the City’s recreational facilities now 
falls to the City of North Port’s Division of Parks and Recreation, which was created after the 
adoption of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan. Athletic fields at five parks along with the 
Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park and Marina Park are managed directly by the County. 
Two recreational facilities – the Al Goll Community Center  and the North Port Swimming Pool– 
are managed by the local YMCA under a n inter local Agreement with Sarasota County  and the 
City of North Port . 
Recreational facilities built since the 2008 Comprehensive Plan update include the Morgan Family Community Center, multiple improvements to Atwater Park  including a Splash Pad and 
playground, a playground at the George Mullen Activity Center, the development of Oaks Park 
and adjoining sections of the Myakkahatchee Creek trail , a “Canine Club” dog park, and multiple 
park enhancements and amenities.   
Owned  by the Sarasota County School District but partially funded by the City of North Port, the 
1,000- plus seat North Port Performing Arts Center on the North Port High School campus 
continues to serve as a site for both school performances and for local community groups to 
perform in . 
First-phase development of the City’s next major park, the Garden of the Five Senses , was 
completed  at the time of the last Comprehensive Plan update. The 16- acre park site incorporates 
native plants that can be appreciated by all of the senses, walking trails and water features. Future plans call for  a pavilion for large groups, and a playground in subsequent phases. Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-4 An inventory of North Port parks can be found in as Figure 1.1a of the City’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan  (reproduced below.) 
Needs and Priorities  
City residents, professional parks and recreation consultants and staff members have identified several needs and priorities that should guide the maintenance, funding and future development of the City of North Port’s parks and open space system: 
A. 2005 Evaluation and Appraisal Report  – The product of an exhaustive public input 
process, the City of North Port 2005 Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR) endeavored to define the major issues that have emerged with the City’s demographic transformation. Among the 13 issues identified in the Report, three dealt specifically with parks and recreation:
 
• Funding of Capital Improvements – Park facilities were listed among capital 
improvements for which better funding needs to be provided. 
• Parks and Recreation Facilities – “Throughout this high growth period,” the EAR 
states, “the City has struggled to provide parks and recreational facilities to meet the demands of a diverse population, which is common in platted lands communities that have reached their high growth phase .”  
 Above all, the EAR Citizen Advisory Committees (CACs) stressed the need to develop and adopt a Parks and Recreation Master Plan, and to provide funding to 
develop the facilities identified in that Plan. “The Comprehensive Plan,” the committees also sta ted, “must include language that supports the Parks and 
Recreation Master Plan…” 
 Along with the growing demand for youth facilities, the CACs emphasized that “the City’s parks system must be diversified to meet the needs of the entire community by includin g passive facilities…and facilities for the non -sports minded 
youth.”  
 The CACs expressed concern that the City has not aggressively pursued acquisition of land for park facilities. 
• Continuation of the Myakkahatchee Creek Initiative  – Because the Creek is of 
critical importance to the City as a prime source of potable water and recreational opportunities, the CACs supported the City’s continuing effort to acquire the first two tiers of lots along the Creek, thereby creating a linear passive park/greenway an d 
helping to reduce damage from flooding. According to the EAR, policies that support and implement the adopted Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway Master  Plan (TGW 
Engineering, November 2007) need to be added to the City’s Comprehensive Plan. 
Additional key findings and recommendations in the 2005 EAR include the following: 
• As of the EAR’s October 2005 publication date, the City’s 1997 adopted level -of-
service standard of 10 acres of park and open space per 1,000 residents was met by 
North Port’s 440 acres of public parklands. Not included in this acreage total are the 
8,593 acres that comprise the Myakka State Forest, which lies entirely within the City Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-5 of North Port, and the Myakka River/Deer Prairie Creek preserve, a portion of which lies inside the City.  
• Since 1997, the City has annexed 30 square miles of property. The City has established 
recreational/open space corridors in these annexations, which are depicted on the amended Future Land Use Map. The “Village” land use classification adopted by the City for t hese annexed lands requires that each village include significant parkland and 
open space.   
• An interlocal agreement with the Sarasota County School Board for joint use of 
recreational facilities needs to be pursued more aggressively through strengthening 
existing policies or adding a new policy.  
• Policies protecting historic/archaeological sites need to be strengthened.  
B. Parks and Recreation Master Plan  
 
The City has recently developed its  Parks and Recreation Master Plan ( Toole Design Group, 
2016). While the Commission has not formally  adopted the 2016 Parks and Recreation Master 
Plan, it has been accepted for use in decision making processes for the Parks and Recreation 
Division and other City agencies by the Commission.  and some of its major conclusions and 
recommendations are currently being further tested by means of an online public survey conducted by the Parks and Recreation Division.
 
 
The Master Plan concluded that the City has insufficient park lands and facilities . Population 
projections indicate that by 2040, if the City maintained its current Level of Service standard 
of 10 acres per 1,000 residents, the City will need to acquire  528 acres for additional parks 
and trails through dedications, partnerships or purchase.  The largest portion of this need (363 
acres, or nearly 69% of the unmet needs) are for community parks (parks serving multiple neighborhoods that could be accessed from nearby neighborhoods by bicycles.), with the remaining need (164 acres) for additi onal open space areas.   
In addition, the Master Plan identified additional needs for specific facilities within the City by 2040, based on benchmarks from the State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP). These needs are (number of each item):  
• Baseball Fields (3)  
• Outdoor Basketball Courts (4) 
• Tennis Courts (20) 
• Outdoor Swimming Pools (2) 
• Saltwater Boat Ramps (3)  
 
  Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-6 With these factors in mind, the Master Plan created a list of priorities for the City to achieve in the 25- year horizon of the Plan. In approximate order of priority, the Master Plan states 
that the top 10 priorities requiring the City’s attention should be: 
• Indoor/Outdoor Swimming pool / aquatics center  
• Boating  and Fishing Area, Ramps 
• Improved streets, bike paths, trails , greenways and shaded sidewalks 
• Improvements to existing Parks  
• Multi-purpose athletic fields  
• Indoor fitness and exercise facilities  
• Off-leash d og park  
• Natural Areas and Wildlife Habitats  
• Picnic areas and shelters  
• Playgrounds  
In the immediate term, the conceptual Master Plan offers a five -year Capital Improvements Program 
for parks that is also reflected in the City’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP):  
 
 
Year  Amount  Description  City CIP Funding  
2016 $200,000 Pedestrian/horse bridge from 
Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park to Carlton Preserve  $200K in 2016 
2016 $1,425,005 Construction of Myakkahatchee Creek Trail between Price and Appomattox Dr. $1.425 million in previous years.

  Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-7 The Master Plan consultants recommended the following policy initiatives: 
• Revise the Comprehensive Plan to integrate the concept of open space as an integral part 
of neighborhoods. 
• Revise the Comprehensive Plan to integrate linear  greenways into policies for conservation 
areas.  
• Revise the City’s Land Development Regulations to require the development of neighborhood and community parks in new developments in accordance with the Master 
Plan.  
• Revise the City’s roadway design standards to incorporate sidewalks, bike lanes and street trees on major arterials and collector roads.  
• Institute a formalized joint planning process with Sarasota County government and the  
Sarasota County School Board for the acquisition and development of parks and open space.  
• Revise the Comprehensive Plan to adopt the community park service areas proposed in the 
Master Plan.  
Eight varieties of park and park interconnections should figure in the City’s plans , the Parks 
and Recreation Master Plan consultants recommended:  
1. Community Parks – The 1997 iteration of the City of North Port’s 
Comprehensive Plan includes several goals, objectives and policies that illustrate 
the City’s intention to increase the number of community parks serving the community. As lis ted in the Parks and Recreation Master Plan, the existing 
community parks , also referred to as activity centers  or sports facilities  are: 
• Butler Park /Morgan Family Community Center 
• Dallas White Park /Scout House 
• George Mullen Activity Center /Larry Thoennissen Athletic Fields  
• Narramore Sports Complex 
• Atwater Park   
• Community Educational Center 
 
The Master Plan  also identifies  additional undeveloped park space  that could be 
utilized for community parks, including: 
• Boca Chica Park  
• Oaks Park  
• A 63-acre tract within the West Villages (While there is an identified location 
at present along River Road, the West Villages Improvement District and 
Mattamy Homes, the master developer of the West Villages, may develop the park elsewhere within the West Villages with City app roval.) 
• The Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park, located at the northern end of 
the City.  Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-8 While the City has, in the past, utilized much of the available space in community 
parks with sports facilities , there has also been an effort to set aside space f or open 
space and passive recreational uses.  National surveys indicate that people state their 
greatest need is for open space and natural areas. However, North Port area residents are fortunate in having access to several large open space areas, some of which lie within City boundaries: 
• Myakka State Forest : Containing 8,593 acres and 2.5 miles of frontage on the 
State -protected Myakka River, the forest is located entirely within the City; 
• Myakka River State Park , with 53 square miles (33,920 acres) of wetlands, 
prairies and woodlands, is one of the State Park  System’s largest parks; it is 
within an hour’s drive of North Port; 
• Deer Prairie Creek Preserve  (10,128 acres): 1,229 acres of this Southwest 
Florida Water Management District- managed Preserve lie within City 
boundaries; 
• Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway  and linear park, a preservation corridor of 
approximately 670 acres with over seven miles of frontage  on the 
Myakkahatchee Creek;  
• T. Mabry Carlton Memorial Preserve: A 24,565- acre wildlife preserve with 
80 miles of hiking and equestrian trails located immediately to the north and 
west of North Port.  
• Greenways to be preserved within the West Villages Improvement District  
and the Northeast Quadrant of the City : When the City annexed over 30 
squar e miles of property between  2000 and 2002, the City established 
recreation, open space or conservation corridors in which passive recreational opportunities may be permitted.  
• Oscar Scherer State Park , which contains 1,382 acres of scrubby and pine 
flatwoods along South Creek in nearby Nokomis, is visited by some 130,000 
visitors annually. 
2. Regional Parks – While in the past, there was a desire for the development a 
regional park of approximately 100 acres should be developed to alleviat e the need 
for sports facilitie s, this is no longer the case, although Sarasota County is still 
considering areas  within the City for such a use . Such a park could be developed 
jointly by the City and Sarasota County; as suggested by  the Master Plan. About 25 
percent of the site should be preserved as open space. While there is park space allocated within Activity Center 6, this space may not be large enough to accommodate a large- scale sports facility.  The City should seek a location in the 
northeast quadrant of the City with access to Interstate Highway 75. While this is 
not a high priority for the City, it is an item that should be considered in the long -
term.  Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-9 3. Special Use Facilit ies – The Recreation Needs Assessment process used for the 
development of the Master Plan identified the need for the following special use facilities  as part of the Needs Summary (Section 2.11): 
• Family Aquatics Center  (Highest priority)  
• Boating and Fishing Areas/Boat Ramps (Second highest priority) 
• Multi- Purpose Athletic Fields  
• Community / Recreation Center  
• Gymnasium /Indoor Fitness Facilities  
 
(Historical/Archaeological Sites , while  not identified by the Master Plan as Special 
Use facilities, are high on City government’s list of lands to be preserved.) As part of these efforts, in 2010, the City of North Port developed an Aquatic 
Facilities Master Plan (Aquatic Facilities Plan), assessing current conditions and needs to guide future decision making in regards to aquatic facilities. Based on the recommendations of the Aquatic Facilities Plan, two “Small Family Aquatics Centers” on the East and West sides of the City were recommended, along with several splash pads or spraygrounds, similar to the splash pad that was built at 
Atwater Park. The Aquatic Facilities Plan also recommended retaining the existing YMCA pool with the option to redevelop the site to accommodate a new type of aquatic facility in the future, along with the placement of additional spr aygrounds 
at existing park sites where feasible.  
An additional special use facility that may be developed within North Port that has come to light since the development of the Parks and Recreation Master Plan is the potential creation of a Spring Training  facility within the West Villages that would 
be utilized year -round by at least one major league franchise, as well as being 
available for tournaments hosted by Sarasota County and the State College of Florida. If this were developed, there would also be the potential for sports medicine and hospitality facilities to tie into this use.  
4. Civic Gathering Space – The City of North Port has no dedicated space for 
special events and citywide activities. Construction of additional amenities identified in the site plan for the City’s municipal complex (the “ City Center” ) 
could provide the focal point of the area. It might include development of a mixture of uses incorporating both open space and civic gathering space.  
5. Conservation Areas – Conservation areas and passive open spaces surround and 
thrive within the City of North Port, which is geographically positioned as the gateway to surrounding resource based recreation activities.   Residents can 
appreciate the biodiversity of nature by vis iting local conservation areas, nature 
reserves, historic/archaeological areas, parks or land reclamation areas including:  
• The Myakka State Forest, which lies entirely within City borders 
• The confluence of the Peace and Myakka Rivers near Port Charlotte  
• Deer Prairie Creek, a portion of which lies within the City of North Port  
• The Carlton Reserve and Walton Tract  Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-10 • Myakka Prairie Tract  
• RV Griffin Reserve  
• Deep Creek  
• Little Salt Spring Park (owned by Sarasota County and located within the City 
of North Port) 
In addition, the 160- acre Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park , a passive 
park and open space preserve that begins at the City’s northern border. South of the Environmental Park, the City also owns several parcels abutting the Creek. The City intends to create a linear park and greenway consisting of these parcels, the Environmental Park and approximately 50 additional properties targeted for 
acquisition. Section E of this Elemen t, a brief summary of the Myakkahatchee 
Creek Greenway Master  Plan, addresses plans for the greenway in greater detail.  
6. Bikeways and Trails – The Parks and Recreation Master Plan envisions the 
expansion of a “multi -modal trail system” of bikeways and walking trails. Existing 
major canal rights -of-way, conservation areas and collector roads would form the 
backbone of the system, integrated with a connected network of sidewalks and on-street bike lanes. The goals of this system would be to help preserve re maining 
natural areas, such as streams and canals, and provide alternative transportation and recreational opportunities. The Parks and Recreation Division endorses this concept.  
Creation of the network would require the City to continue to incorporate tre es and 
lighting into roadway designs in order to make sidewalks and trails more inviting 
and user -friendly. The Transportation Element includes a supporting policy 
statement.  Connecting the trails network may also require construction of bridges 
over water ways and land purchases. This ties into the City’s proposed Complete 
Streets language and many of these improvements, including bridges, could be 
funded, in whole or in part, through the City’s proposed mobility fee .  
7. Blueways, Creeks and Access Canals – Two natural waterways, the Myakka 
River and Myakkahatchee Creek, are of vital importance to the City. The Master Plan notes that they flow through reserves, preserves and the Myakka State Forest, providing ample recreational opportunities for people to e njoy Florida’s rich natural 
environment. The City is continuing its initiative to create a linear park and greenway along the Myakkahatchee Creek, as evidenced by the $2.8 million Florida Communities Trust grant awarded in 2007 to expand the Creek corridor. The 
Master Plan calls this initiative “…critical to the greenways, blueways and trails initiative identified in the [Master Plan] as well as vitally important to protecting the native flora and fauna of the area.”  
Acknowledging the presence of water control structures on waterways/canals that 
connect with the Creek, the Master Plan encourages the City to consider acquiring land to allow operators of non-motorized watercraft to portage from one section to another. Drop- in and take -out points could be located in existing and future parks, 
and environmental education centers could be located at waterfront parks, the Master Plan suggests.  Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-11 Subsequent to this, the City developed a Canal and Creek System Master Plan (Canal Plan) to identify opportunities for a comprehensive blueway system within the City. The City has subsequently developed the first phase of the Canal Plan, allowing for rower s, canoers, and kayakers to utilize the Cocoplum and Blueridge 
Waterways and Myakkahatchee  Creek by identifying and providing launch sites 
and accessibility to portage sites at water management devices. Subsequent phases of the Canal Plan will allow for ac cess to additional waterways, fishing piers, and 
additional launch sites within the city .  
Several City parks abutting the waterway/canal system provide launch, docking and rest areas for boaters.  Funding for the acquisition of additional access points is  
indicated beginning on Page 136 of the Parks and Recreation Master Plan and is included as part of the City’s Capital Improvement Plan .   
The 2016 Master Plan estimates that the cost of developing all of the facilities identified in 
the ten -year Vision is $15,460,641. Some cost reductions could be accomplished through 
potential partnerships with the County and the School Board. 
C. Parks and Recreation Division Recommendations  – Taking into account a thorough 
review of the 2008 iteration of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, the recommendations of 
the Parks and Recreation Master Plan  (including public comment received as part of the 
development of the Master Plan) , the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway Master Plan and its 
own internal planning processes, the Cit y considers the following to be priority guidelines 
for the future of the City’s parks and open space system.  
1. Land acquisition for new parks – Based on population projections, the conceptual 
Master Plan concludes that the City will need an additional 528 acres for parks and 
trails by 20 40. Over  Approximately 50 percent of the 483 acres currently in the 
City’s park system is conservation space not available for development. The Division acknowledges that the City’s top priority should be acquisition of land for recreational purposes.  
2. Responsiveness to community needs – While acknowledging the importance of 
establishing population and acreage level of service guidelines for planning purposes, the North Port Parks and Recreation Division believes that North Port should also develop parks and recreational facilities and amenities that reflect the special needs of various constituencies  while recognizing the changing 
demographics of North Port. 
3. Private developers – The City supports the addition of a Comprehensive Plan 
policy (please see Policy 6.3)  that requires private developers to set aside land for 
public parks and open space as a precondition for development. While there are 
limited opportunities for these amenities to be provided in the platted areas in the 
eastern part of the city, as the West Villages is developed, lands have been (or will be) set aside for public uses, including a proposed dog park along River Road north of US 41 and the 63- acre park space along River Road south of US 41 identified in 
the Parks and Recreation Master Plan. If the developments proposed for the Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-12 northeast corner of the city were to take place, developer provided parkland would be required as well.  
4. An interconnected network of parks and open spaces –  Bike paths on roadways, 
pedestrian/bicyclist bridges, sidewalks and canal right s-of- ways should be used to 
connect parks and open spaces, thereby encouraging residents to use means other than motorized transportation to gain access to recre ational amenities.  This also ties 
into the development of a Complete Streets program that is currently being explored.  
D. Local Option One Percent Infrastructure Surtax  – Sarasota County voters, 
including North Port residents, voted Nov. 6, 2007, to extend the County -wide local option 
one percent infrastructure surtax for another 15 years (i.e., from 2010 through 2024). The City of North Port has committed over 25 percent ($36.8 million) of anticipated surtax revenues to the following parks and open s pace projects:  
1. Land acquisition for future neighborhood and community parks –$4,600,000 
2. Improvements to existing parks – $2,500,000 3. Recreational, educational and arts facilities for adults – $1,070,602 4. Myakkahatchee  Creek land acquisition and improvements – $3,300,000: 
Specifically, surtax revenues would be used to complete the purchase of second-
tier properties needed to widen this preservation and recreational corridor, as well as to develop trail heads, watercraft  launching areas with shelters, a limited number 
of playgrounds, an observation deck and other recreational amenities. 
5. Regional multi -purpose park – $14,150,000: The City, in partnership with 
Sarasota County, proposes to construct a regional park of approximately 100 acres 
to be located in  the northeast quadrant of the City with access to Interstate Highway 
75. Athletic facilities, gymnasiums, playgrounds, shelters, concessions stands , and 
an aquatics center are among those proposed for this type of park. Construction of 
this park is also supported by the conceptual Parks and Recreation Master Plan. 
6. Leisure, arts, cultural and historical facilities  – $1,952,718: Proposed facilities 
would include public monuments and artwork, and interpretive signage and support 
facilities for historical sites such as the State -registered archaeological site called 
Little Salt Spring.  
7. Land acquisition along greenways, roadways, pathways and waterways – 
$1,400,000: One of the conceptual Master Plan’s strongest recommendations is 
development of an interconnected, pedestrian- and bicyclist -oriented network of 
connections between parks and open spaces. Land acquisition will be needed in order to implement the network. Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-13 8. Improvements for trails and greenways – $2,150,000: Construction of new hiking 
and biking trails and associated amenities such as rest areas, shelters, footbridges and observation decks. 
9. Construction of amenities for youth- oriented recreational facili ties – $2,150,000: 
One of the highest -priority needs identified by the pubic, consultants and the North 
Port City Commission is construction of youth- and teen -oriented recreational 
facilities. Foremost among these priorities is the construction of a teen/ community 
center.  
10. Water recreation facilities – $3,150,000: Construction of watercraft launches, 
docks and ramps for non- motorized access to City canals.  
E. Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway Master  Plan  – A goal of the City for several 
years, the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway Concept Plan identifies specific strateg ies and 
amenities for the implementation of the City of North Port’s largest and most important 
recreational amenity, the Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway and preservation corridor. To be est ablished along Myakkahatchee Creek within City limits, the G reenway lies in the 
middle of urban development . In many respects, the Greenway occupies a standing in the 
community similar to that of New York City’s Central Park.  
The greenway will provide a multitude of benefits to the citizens of North Port and the 
State, including:  
• Preservation of critical environmental lands and habitats; 
• Creation of a linear parkway with the potential for many predominantly passive 
recreational activities; 
• Protection of water quality within the Creek, which is a critical source of potable water for the City and the immediate local area;  
• Minimization of development encroachment into the Creek floodplain; 
• Creation of wildlife corridors;  
• Educational opportunities for the community; and  
• Potential incorporation into the statewide system of Greenways and Trails, per Chapter 260, F.S. 
The Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway Concept Plan was presented to the public in January 
2007, and the final draft of the Plan  was formally adopted by the North Port City 
Commission in November 2007. Highlights of the Plan include the following: 
1. Intensity of recreational uses based on distance from the Creek  – Three options 
for development of the Greenway, ranging from Option A, the most restrictive, to 
Option C, the least restrictive in terms of allowable activities, are set forth in the Greenway Master Plan. All options recommend the formation of a continuous, uninterrupted corridor on both sides of the Creek north of U.S. Highway 41. 
The Greenway Plan described the three options as follows: Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-14 • Option A  affords maximum protection of the waterway. Only passive activities are 
allowable. These activities include nature trails, handicapped access points and areas, natural scenic area s, canoe and kayak access points and picnic tables.  
• Option B  also affords protection of the waterway and the upland corridor while 
allowing additional passive activities such as a fitness trail and a fenced paw park. 
• Option C , the most permissive of the options, allows additional features and 
activities such as a horse trail, a bicycle trail  and a primitive camping area.  
The Plan recommends that only those passive activities specified in Option A and Option B be allowed on lands immediately adjacent to the Myakkahatchee Creek. This 
maximally protected section of the corridor runs from the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in the north to Appomattox Drive in the south. 
More active recreational pursuits like those identified in Option C will only be allow ed 
upland from the  creek -front Tier I parcels  and roadways, and in no case any closer to 
the Creek than the Tier II parcels.  
2. Master Plan Phasing – As of September 2007, the City owns or has access to 279 
parcels out of the 281 parcels fronting on the Cr eek in Tier I, also identified in the 
Greenway Plan as Phase 1 . The acquisition of 160+ parcels in Tier II will be required 
in order to allow implementation of Phase 2.  
The City is actively engaged in acquiring the remaining Tier I parcels  and has 
embarked  on acquisition of Tier II properties. Together, Tiers I and II will  provide a 
continuous, publicly -owned G reenway along the entire waterway north of U.S. 
Highway 41. The Myakkahatchee Creek Greenway will be implemented in two 
phases:  
Phase 1 – Developme nt of a passive greenway corridor along the waterway which 
will include low -impact activities such as natural hiking trails; benches; portions of 
an exercise loop trail; foot bridges; and educational, historic and trail signage. 
These features will be located along the banks of and in immediate proximity to the 
Creek corridor.  
Phase 2 –Additional activities landward in the Tier II properties will include a 
bicycle trail, exercise stations, picnic tables and gathering areas.  
3. Phase 1 (Tier I) Implementation  – The objectives of Phase 1 will be to provide 
only passive recreational opportunities along the waterway and  to improve and expand 
such opportunities  in the Creek -front areas of  the existing Environmental, Butler and 
Oaks Parks. The  Greenwa y Plan states that the  major components of the Tier I portion 
of the greenway include: 
• Existing Parks –  Parks include the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park, 
Oaks Park, Butler Park and two proposed new trailhead parks: Greenwood Park 
and Pan Am Park.  
• Environmental Park improvements – Many of the existing attributes of both 
the east and west sides of this Par k will be upgraded or expanded. Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-15 • Oaks Park improvements – Existing features will be upgraded and/or 
expanded. 
• Butler Park improvements – Existing features will be improved , including the 
upgrading of the existing playing fields to a well- drained, lighted, multiuse 
facility.  and additional park facilities (including a medium scale aquatic center) 
will be developed here, and this Park   
 
New Trailhead  Parks – The Greenway Master Plan proposes two new parks: 
• Greenwood Park , to be  located along the C reek in the vicinity of Greenwood 
Avenue and North Port Boulevard. The park  would function as a trailhead park 
entrance. Minor amenities would include an information kiosk, bike racks, benches and several picnic tables. Parking would be located at the old City Hall lot. 
• Pan Am Park  would be located along the east side of the Creek near U.S. 
Highway 41 and Pan American Boulevard. Creation of the park would require the purchase of privately owned land. Pan Am Park would have minor amenities, including an information kiosk, bike racks, benches and several picnic tables, and a trail c onnecting to Greenwood Park via an existing 
pedestrian bridge and sidewalk.  
Tier I Trails and Trailheads – Approximately 11 miles of trails currently exist on 
the Tier I properties adjacent to the Myakkahatchee Creek. The Greenway Master Plan states that e ight miles of these trails are in poor condition, 2.5 miles are in fair 
condition, and one -half mile is in good condition. The Plan proposes using the 
existing trails as part of a looped greenway trail system.  Enhancing the existing trail 
system and adding  four more miles of new trails are proposed to complete Phase 1, 
resulting in  a total greenway trail system consisting of 15 miles of looped trails.  
Five main trailheads, providing both access and recreational activities, would be part of this trail system. The existing Environmental Park, Oaks Park and Butler Park would provide three of the trailheads. The Greenway Master Plan designates the proposed Greenwood and Pan Am Parks as the fourth and fifth trailheads. 
Although the trailhead parks would provide similar services, including parking, 
restrooms and picnic tables, each would have unique features and activities.  
In addition, several portage locations along the Myakkahatchee Creek have been 
constructed  and several more will be developed as part of the C ity’s Blueway plan.  
4. Phase 2 (Tier II) Implementation  – Phase 2 of the Master Greenway Plan will 
involve approximately 35 acres of land on both the east and west sides of the Myakkahatchee Creek from just north of Interstate Highway 75 to the Snover  
Waterway along the Creek. As of the writing of this Element, these properties are privately owned, and the City intends to continue to negotiate with property owners for amicable purchase. Additionally, the C ity has received $2.8 million in grant 
funding from the Florida Communities Trust Program in order to reduce the cost of 
acquisition. Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-16 More active “Option C” recreational components are intended for Tier II  properties , 
which parallel the more sensitive Tier I properties abutting the Creek. Development and final layout of activities and amenities for Tier II are not yet finalized.  
Goals of Tier II property acquisition –
 Foremost among the reasons for the City’s 
continued major emphasis on preserving the Myakkahatchee Creek greenway are protection of this  regionally significant source of potable water and provision of 
passive and moderately active recreational opportunities. Additional and related goals include: 
• Preserv ing upland habitat for native plants, trees and animal species, including 
the protected gopher tortoise and scrub jay; 
• Providing connectivity between the greenway and privately and publicly owned 
property north of the City; 
• Encouraging the c reation of  an additional northern extension of the greenway 
within the Carlton Preserve to the north; 
• Through preservation of these lands in their undeveloped state, preserving 
floodwater storage capacity and reducing the impacts of seaso nal flooding on 
populated areas. 
Proposed Tier II activities and facilities –
 The Greenway Master Plan lists several 
activities and recreational amenities that would be appropriate for Tier II: 
• A bike path from Interstate Highway 75 to the southern limits of the greenway at the Snover Waterway;  
• Playground and picnic pavilion on the west side of the Creek, north of the Snover; 
• Picnic area on the east side;  
• Butterfly gardens;  
• Replanting of disturbed lands with native species; 
• Wildlife observation platform; 
• Horseshoe pits; 
• Educational kiosk and signage; 
• Handicapped sidewalk ; 
• Canoe and kayak access points; 
• Nature/hiking trails . 
Other recreational opportunities  
In addition to public recreational facilities provided by City government, North Port area residents have a rich variety of other recreational opportunities available to them. 
A. Golf courses –Within the City limits are two  semi -private golf courses:  Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-17 • Heron Creek Golf and Country Club – 27 holes, driving range , fitness center , six 
tennis courts and a swimming pool; and  
• Bobcat Trail Golf and Country Club  – 18 holes, swimming pool , two  tennis courts. 
Prior to late 2015, there was a third 18- hole golf course located in the City (Sable Trace Golf 
Club off of Greenwood Boulevard.) This site is, as of October , 2016, currently on the market. 
It is unknown if the golf course will remain as such after the sale of the course lands.  
B. Fishing and boating – The Myakkahatchee Creek, the Myakka River and the City’s own 
84 miles of waterways/canals offer ample opportunity and variety for fishing -minded 
sportsmen. Marina Park is a favorite spot to fish, as well as to observe manatees in the colder 
months.  
C. Baseball, softball , football, and basketball  - Volunteer- run T -ball, Little League, Girls 
Softball and Senior League baseball programs are available in North Port. Also v ery popular 
with young people are the Pop Warner Football program , North Port Huskies  football program,  
North Port youth soccer program, and the North Port Youth Basketball program.  
D. The North Port Performing Arts Center – T he second largest live -performance theater 
in Sarasota County , the North Port Performing Arts Center has 1 ,023 seats : 721 seats on the 
main floor  and 302 i n the balcony . Located on the campus of North Port High School, i t was 
opened to the  public in December 2001. Three amateur performing arts groups make the 
Performing A rts Center their home venue: The  North Port Orchestra, the North Port Chorale 
and the North Port Concert Band. 
Founded in 1949, the Florida West Coast Symphony  of Sarasota is the olde st continuing 
orchestra in the S tate of Florida.  The North Port Performing Arts Center is one of the symphony  
orchestra’s regular performance venues.  
Other performing arts venues in Sarasota County include the Van Wezel Performing Arts 
Center , Florida Studio Theater, and Sarasota Opera House  in Sarasota, Venice Little Theater 
and Lemon Bay Theatre in Englewood. 
E. Warm Mineral Springs – Warm Mineral Springs is a city -owned facility whose 
centerpiece is a bathing area in a natural sinkhole. Attracted by the healing properties ascribed 
to this mineral- laden lake, over 80,000 guests visit the Springs annually. Natural thermal 
heating maintains the lake’s temperature at a constant, year -round temperature of 87 degrees. 
Massage, water aerobics, acupuncture and other wellness services are offered.  
F. Beaches – Sarasota County has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, many 
within a 30-to 45-minute drive from North Port: 
• Caspersen Beach (Venice);  
• North Jetty Park (Venice);  
• Venice Beach;  
• Blind Pass Beach (Englewood); Recreation and Open Space Element 
 
 
 6-18 • Manasota Beach (Englewood); 
• Englewood Beach; and 
• Stump Pass Beach (Englewood).  
G. Open Spaces  – The City of North Port owns open spaces of two general types: (1) mowed 
open spaces in neighborhoods with no recreational facilities and (2) unimproved open spaces for which development plans do not currently exist. These open spaces include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  
• Open spaces established through annexations; 
• Neighborhood open space on Pan American Boulevard; and 
• Open space on the New London Waterway. 
Open spaces are depicted on the Existing Parks, Future Parks, Recreation Open Space Sites and Conservation Map in this Element.  Recreation and Open Space Element

 7-3 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION ELEMENT 
 
Many formal and informal networks of information and coordination currently exist between the 
City of North Port and other governmental units and agencies. These units and agencies often participate in some phase of planning involving land use and/or provision of services necessitating coo rdination with Sarasota County.  
The following section provides an inventory of these information and coordination networks between the City, Sarasota County and adjacent counties, local authorities and special districts, regional authorities and districts , State agencies and federal agencies.  
The City of North Port coordinates with the counties adjacent to its borders – Sarasota, Charlotte 
and DeSoto Counties – on various issues. The networks of coordination are useful and effective 
and include contractual  arrangements, interlocal agreements and both formal and informal 
procedures.  
One example of this cooperation is the City’s membership on the bi -county Englewood Area 
Planning and Advisory Board, which coordinates issues relating to the unincorporated are a of 
Englewood in Charlotte and Sarasota Counties.  Another example is the City’s practice of sending copies of any development proposals located 
within four miles of the City’s boundary to the appropriate adjacent county for review and comment. Other exam ples include the City’s non -voting participation with the three neighboring 
counties and Manatee County on the Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority. Through the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program, the City coordinates with Charlotte, Sarasota and Lee Counties.  
I. Inventory 
The City of North Port coordinates with Sarasota County, adjacent counties and the Cities of Sarasota, Venice and the Town of Longboat Key as circumstances require. A substantial portion of this coordination is achieved through periodic joint meetings of the elected governing bodies and the Sarasota County Council of Governments, Interlocal Agreements and Mutual Aid Agreements.  
The State- mandated Interlocal Service -Delivery Report of December 23, 2003, required the 
identification of all interlocal agreements to which the municipalities and Sarasota County were 
party regarding the provision of education, sanitary sewer, public safety, solid waste, drainage, potable water, parks and recreation and transportation. Interloc al agreements were to be 
examined for duplication and deficits.  
This cooperative county/municipal Report identified the City of North Port as a signatory to 44 
interlocal agreements specifically addressing the subject topics. See Table 7-2 f or a list of  these 
agreements.  
Table 7 -1 lists the special districts that are located within the City’s jurisdictional boundaries.

The City also communicates and coordinates effectively with several other local authorities and 
special districts, including those listed below:  
• School Board of Sarasota County 
• Sarasota Soil and Water Conservation District  
• Englewood Water District 
• Sarasota County Fire Rescue District  
• Sarasota County Mosquito Control Distri ct 
• Sarasota County Public Hospital District 
• Southwest Florida Water Control District 
 
Sarasota County 
Along with other Sarasota County municipalities, the City of North Port communicates both 
formally and informally with Sarasota County Government and many  of its agencies on a regular 
basis.  
The Sarasota County Board of County Commissioners and the North Port City Commission hold joint meetings on a semi- regular basis as circumstances warrant. In addition, County and 
municipal elected officials and high -level administrators attend periodic formal meetings of the 
Sarasota County Council of Governments. 
Sarasota County Government provides several services to the City of North Port, such as library 
services, mosquito control, State/County Health Department services and management of some North Port parks. 
Joint Planning and Interlocal Service Boundary Agreement 
In August 2006, Sarasota County announced a referendum proposal that would amend the 
County’s Charter to give the County control over all land use decisions, including land annexed into a city. The Charter amendment proposal led to the Cities of North Port and Venice and  Intergovernmental Coordination   
 
 
 7-5 Sarasota County enter into  a  dialogue regarding how the Cities and County could proac tively  
address the issues of annexation (e.g. regional growth man agement, revenue shifts affecting 
committed and planned infrastructure and potential duplication of public facilities and services ). 
The Cities and Sarasota subsequently  agreed to a six -month moratorium on the acceptance and 
processing of any annexation ap plications and the resultant comprehensive plan amendments. 
The parties further agreed to actively participate in a facilitated discussion to establish, adopt and 
implement a Joint Planning Agreement and Interlocal Service Boundary Agreement (JPA/ISBA) 
that would address cross -jurisdictional impacts on infrastructure, land use, capital improvements, 
timing of development and other issues of regional concern between the Cities and County. 
The principal elements  the of JPA/ISBA were expected at a minimum to a ddress following 
concepts : 
• An systematic  process to ensure infrastructure and services that are neither duplicative or 
place undue financial burden on the part of property owners and residents of the non-
impacting community;  
• A mechanism whereby the impacts of development in proposed future annexation areas to the county transportation network are carefully analyzed and coordinated;  
• A mechanism for coordinated efforts related to water supply and sewer service, master 
planning and related financial strategies in those areas of proposed future annexation;  
• Ensured environmental stewardship through continuity of preservation, regulatory 
consistency and environmental impact analysis in areas of future annexation or mutual concern; and,  
• Coordination and compatibility between comprehensive plans in future annexed areas to 
ensure appropriate, compatible land uses and neighborhood preservation. 
 
The comprehensive draft JPA/ISBA, betwe en the City of North Port and Sarasota County was 
negotiated after three public meetings between  the two elected bodies and extensive staff input.  
The result was the adoption of an ordinan ce, January  24, 2006, and a comprehensive JPA/ISBA.  
 In August 2006, Sarasota County announced a referendum proposal that would amend the 
County’s Charter to give the County control over all land use decisions, including land annexed 
into a city.   Later, the  County Commissioners indicated that they intended to place the Charter 
Amendment referendum on the March 13, 2007 ballot. Following the County’s decision, an opt -
out clause was added to the North Port JPA giving the City the option to terminate the Agreement within 60 days of the effective date of the Charter Amendment. On May 9, 2007, 
after passage of the County  Charter Amendment, the North Port City Commission exercised this 
option and directed City staff to draft a revised JPA for consideration when joint negotiations 
resume.  
Sarasota County municipalities 
The City of North Port communicates on an as -needed ba sis with the City of Venice, the City of 
Sarasota and the Town of Longboat Key. The Sarasota County Council of Governments provides 
a convenient forum for the exchange of ideas and the identification of common challenges.  Intergovernmental Coordination   
 
 
 7-6 The Venice City Council and the North Port City Commission hold joint meetings on an as -
needed basis.  
Charlotte County Government 
The Charlotte County Board of County Commissioners and the North Port City Commission 
hold joint meetings on an as-needed basis. Additionally, the monthly meeti ngs of the Peace River 
Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority provide an effective forum for City of North Port elected officials and administrators to meet with their Charlotte County peers.  
DeSoto County Government 
As with Charlotte County, the regular  meetings of the Peace River Manasota Regional Water 
Supply Authority keep important lines of communication open between City officials and 
DeSoto County government leaders. The City shares a boundary with DeSoto County; as North Port grows, interaction be tween the two governments will increase.  
The School Board of Sarasota County 
The City and School Board have had a long working relationship providing and receiving 
information for new school locations to serve the School Board’s growing student population. The 2002 Florida legislative session mandated more extensive school facilities planning coordination with local land use planning.  To fulfill this legislative requirement, the School Board, Sarasota County and the municipalities officially adopted the Interlocal Agreement for Public School Facility Planning for Sarasota County, Florida , in July 2003. This Agreement was 
forwarded to the Florida Department of Community Affairs, which found it to be consistent with the State’s requirements.  
On May 31, 2007, the Interlocal Agreement for Public School Facility Planning was amended to 
implement school concurrency. Details of this agreement and other coordination activities 
between North Port and the School Board of Sarasota County are discussed in the North Port Comprehensive Plan’s Schools Facilities Element.  
Sarasota Office of Housing and Community Development 
A long and mutually beneficial relationship has existed between the City and the Sarasota Office 
of Housing and Community Development (OHCD), which is supported jointly by the City and County of Sarasota. 
North Port has on several occasions received significant disbursements from the county -wide 
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, which is administered by this agency. 
As of the 2008 submission of this Comprehensive Plan, the City was about to receive $400,000 in CDBG funds for the Family Services Center project, scheduled for a construction start date sometime in the first quarter of that year. Other CDBG disbursements received by the City have included $260,000 for a Head Start/Early Head Start facility and $400,000 toward the construction of a low- income apartment building.  
Because North Port residents constitute the largest single group of OHCD program beneficiaries, the agency is considering opening an office in North Port. As of 2006, 41.4% of all Down Payment Assistance Program participants in Sarasota County bought homes in North Port, and one-third of all non- profit housing partnerships went toward the construction of new homes in 
the City. North Port residents were 7.4% of all Owner Occupied Rehabilitation Program 
beneficiaries in the County.  Intergovernmental Coordination   
 
 
 7-7 Soil and Water Conservation District 
The City is a beneficiary of the services provided by the Sarasota Soil and Water Conservation 
District. The District comments on Developments of Regional Impact proposed within  the City.  
Community Development Districts  
The City of North Port interacts with and provides some services to three Community Development Districts (CDDs): Bobcat Trail, Lakeside Plantation and The Woodlands. All three are zoned ‘Planned Community Development (PCD).’ All are subject to the requirements of Chapter 190, Florida Statutes (Community Development Districts), which permits the establishment of CDDs as an alternative method to finance infrastructure and manage basic services.  
Bobcat Trail Community Development District  
Created by City Ordinance No. 97 -9, the Bobcat Trail Community Development District 
(BTCDD) originally encompassed 369.34±  acres.  The District’s boundaries were a mended by 
City Ordinance 98- 37 to include land west of Toledo Blade Boulevard, bringing total BTCDD 
acreage to 423.34± acres. The site is located on the east side of Toledo Blade Boulevard, approximately 2.5 miles south of Interstate Highway 75 Exit 179 and approximately 1.25 miles north of the intersection of Toledo Blade Boulevard and U.S. 41. 
According to the developer’s original Statement of Estimated Regulatory Costs, the project was 
to contain approximately 441 single- family dwelling units, 110 villa units, an 18-hole golf course 
and other recreational amenities.  The subsequent addition of lands west of Toledo Blade have 
resulted in the creation of 8 commercial/office/industrial lots, and the ability to develop 447 multi- family residential units in wha t is now known as Toledo Club apartments (347 units) and a 
slightly more than 12- acre parcel  located to the south of Toledo Club between Kenvil Drive and 
the Creighton Waterway.  
Lakeside Plantation Community Development District  
Created by City Ordinance N o. 99- 1, the Lakeside Plantation Development District (LPCDD) 
encompasses 306.072 acres east of and adjacent to Toledo Blade Boulevard and north of the Snover Waterway. LPCDD is slated to have 666 dwelling units at build-out. 
The establishment of the LPCDD  was granted subject to several conditions, including the 
following: 
• The developers signed a Developers Agreement with the City of North Port Utilities 
Department to obtain central water and sanitary sewer service from the City.  
• The LPCDD agreed to abide by all planning, environmental and land development laws, regulations and ordinances adopted by the City of North Port. 
The Woodlands Community Development District 
Created by City Ordinance No. 04 -32, The Woodlands Community Development District 
(WCDD) ori ginally encompassed 980.4 acres east of and adjacent to Toledo Blade Boulevard 
and north of Lakeside Plantation CDD. City Ordinance No. 07- 15 contracted the District’s 
boundaries to encompass 960.3± acres. 
The developer has estimated The Woodlands will contain approximately 1,687 single -family  Intergovernmental Coordination   
 
 
 7-8 residential units and 814 multi- family residential units, for a combined total of 2,501 residential 
units. 
West Villages Improvement District  
The West Villages Improvement District (WVID) consists of approximately 8,2 00 acres. At 
build- out, it is planned for up to 20,000 residential units and 300 to 1,000 acres of mixed- use, 
“Town Center” development.  
The WVID was created by and operates under Chapter 2004- 456, Laws of Florida, and operates 
pursuant to the Act and applicable provisions of Chapter 298, Florida Statutes. Zoned ‘Village 
(V),’ the WVID was created to construct and maintain public works and utilities, including 
water, sewer, drainage, irrigation, stormwater management, parks and recreational facilities, roadway and related facilities. The District has no police power and no eminent domain power, 
nor any zoning or land use power. It cannot levy a millage. The WVID can collect assessments from land owners and issue government bonds to construct infrastructure.  
The WVID is governed by a five -member Board of Supervisors, each member of which holds 
office for a four -year term. Two Supervisors are elected at the annual Landowners’ Meeting, at 
which any landowner who owns an acre or fraction thereof is entitled to vote, on an owned-
acreage basis, for each Supervisor position up for election. 
Mosquito Control District 
The Mosquito Control District is an independent district under the Sarasota County Board of 
Commissioners, which provides mosquito control and spraying  services to North Port and the 
rest of the County. The District reviews and comments on issues associated with developments of regional impact and other large- scale planning projects or issues as needed.  
Englewood Water District  
The Englewood Water Distri ct (EWD), created by a special act of the State Legislature, is 
governed by the Englewood Water District Board and provides water to two of Sarasota County’s franchised water supply systems. The District is a member of the Water Planning Alliance, as noted  in the Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority discussion 
below . The City’s Utilities Department has the primary responsibility for ensuring effective 
coordination with the Englewood Water District. Contacts and coordination with the EWD ha ve 
increased with the development of the West Villages.  
Coordination with Regional Authorities and Districts 
The City of North Port coordinates with various regional authorities and districts, including the 
Sarasota Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization; the Southwest Florida Water Management District; the Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority; the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council; the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program; the Myakka State Forest Coordinating Council; and the Myakka River Management Coordinating Council. Coordination between the City and these regional authorities and districts has been useful and should be continued. The following are brief descriptions of these regional authorities and districts.  
Sarasota Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization  
Composed of appointed officials from Sarasota and Manatee Counties and their respective  Intergovernmental Coordination   
 
 
 7-9 municipalities, the Sarasota Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) directs ongoing 
transportation studies for the Sarasota/Manatee urban area. The City’s Planning and Zoning and Public Works Departments coordinate efforts regarding transportation planning issues with the MPO, and the Sarasota County Area Transit system (SCAT) works closely with the MPO regarding trans it system planning. In addition, the City of North Port is represented on the 
MPO’s Technical Advisory Committee. The MPO is a member of the City’s Development Review Committee and reviews and comments on transportation planning issues affecting the City.  
Charlotte County -Punta Gorda Metropolitan Planning Organization 
The City also coordinates with the Charlotte County -Punta Gorda Metropolitan Planning 
Organization  through its staff membership on the MPO’s Technical Advisory Committee , 
although not as a vot ing member.  
Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council (SWFRPC) 
Located in Fort Myers, the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council is composed of elected 
officials and appointed representatives from Sarasota, Charlotte, DeSoto, Glades, Collier, Hendry , and Lee Counties. The City’s Planning and Zoning Department staff works closely with 
the SWFRPC regarding the coordination of the City’s Comprehensive Plan with regional and State plans, review of developments of regional impact, and other planning related issues. The Florida Regional Planning Council Act of 1980, as amended, mandates that regional planning councils prepare and adopt Strategic Regional Policy Plans. The SWFRPC adopted its Regional Comprehensive Policy Plan in May 1987, and updated that pl an with a revised Strategic 
Regional Policy plan in 1995 and again on June 13, 2002. Section 163.3167 (11), Florida Statutes, as amended, requires local government comprehensive plans to be consistent with the Strategic Regional Policy Plans as well as the  State Comprehensive Plan (Chapter 187, Florida 
Statutes).  
Southwest Florida Water Management District  
The Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) is an important partner in 
management of the City of North Port’s water programs. SWFWMD’s headquarters are located in Brooksville, and a service office is located in Sarasota. The District serves all or part of 16 counties from Levy to Charlotte, including Sarasota County. The District’s governance is further divided into nine basin boards based upon watershed boundaries. Sarasota and Manatee County with a small part of Charlotte County comprise the Manasota Basin Board. SWFWMD’s Areas of Responsibility (AORs) include flood protection, water quality, natural systems, water supply and water conservat ion. The City interacts with the district in all of these areas. SWFWMD has 
regulatory responsibilities for water supply (consumptive use permitting) and surface water management (stormwater discharges for water quality and flood protection). The City of N orth 
Port is required to coordinate the Potable Water Element of its Comprehensive Plan with the District’s Regional Water Supply Plan. SWFWMD has funded several projects that benefit the City, including an ongoing study of the Big Slough Basin, the predominant sub- regional basin 
that most directly affects drainage in the City. The City’s Utilities Department is primarily responsible for ensuring effective intergovernmental coordination with SWFWMD. 
Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority  
Saras ota County, as well as Manatee, DeSoto and Charlotte Counties, formed the Peace  Intergovernmental Coordination   
 
 
 7-10 River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority in order to ensure adequate water supply 
within the four-c ounty region. The City of North Port purchases water from the Authority , and 
through an intergovernmental agreement the Authority in turn may purchase water from the City. The Authority also acts as the administrative agency for the Water Planning Alliance. The Alliance is a voluntary planning body made up of representatives from the Englewood Water District and all counties and cities located within the Authority’s four -county region. The 
Alliance’s goal is to cooperatively plan for the region’s water supply needs. It functions as a coordinating body between jurisdictions. 
Myakka River Management Coordinating Council 
The Myakka River Wild and Scenic Designation and Preservation Act (Section 258.501, Florida 
Statutes) created a permanent Myakka River Management Coordinating Council to develop a management plan for the Myakka Ri ver and to provide interagency and intergovernmental 
coordination in the management of the river. The City of North Port  will be adopting reg ulations 
to implement the Myakka River Protection Plan.  
Coordination with State Agencies 
The City of North Port coordinates with many departments and agencies of Florida State 
Government, including the Departments of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Business and Professional Regulation, Community Affairs, Environmental Protection, Health and Rehabilitative Services,  Transportation, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; 
Manatee Community College and the University of South Florida. Coordination with these State departments and agencies has been effective and should be continued. The following is a list of selected State departments and agencies typical of the coordination efforts that currently exist 
between them and the City.

Center for Innovation and Technology  and the Medical Technology and Simulation Center  at 
Lakewood Ranch, many business and public sector sites throughout the community, and from 
their homes via distance learning  opportunities. 
The City frequently interacts with SCF ’s Institute for Workforce Development Services, which 
assists local businesses, government and industry by providing training and economic development services. 
University of South Florida - Sarasota Manatee (USF -SM) at SCF Venice/North Port 
campus  
The University of South Florida began offering courses at  the then  Manatee Comm unity College 
in 2004. In May 2006, USF -SM’s south Sarasota County program became a permanent campus

Sarasota- Manatee at SCF  offers coursework toward bachelor’s  degrees in the following 
programs: Criminology, Interdisciplinary Social Sciences, Psychology, General Business and Elementary Education.  
Coordination with Federal Agencies  
The City of North Port coordinates with agencies of the federal government regarding such 
issues as the environment; fish and wildlife protection; flood insurance; census and housing data; 
and funding for transportation and transit planning. The federal agencies that the City of North Port coordinates with include: The  Environmental Protection Agency; the Army Corps of 
Engineers; the Natural Resources Conservation Service; the Federal Emergency Management Administration; the Flood Insurance Administration; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and the Departments of the Interior, Commerce , Housing and Urban Development , Homeland Security , 
and Transportation. 
Coordination with Utility Companies 
Governed by the North Port City Commission, the North Port Utilities Department provides 
potable water and central sewer service to its customers, most of whom are residents of the City. The primary source of potable water for the City is the Peace River. Water withdrawn from the Peace River is treated at a water plant administered by the Peace River Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority and distributed to the City of North Port and the Counties of Sarasota, Charlotte, Manatee and DeSoto. The City’s secondary source of potable water is the Myakkahatchee Creek. Under a Consumptive Use Permit issued by the Southwest Florida Water Management District,  North Port Utilities withdraws and treats water from the Creek at a City -
owned plant and distributes it to customers. North Port Utilities Department provides central sewer service for many areas of the City. Private wells and septic systems serve other p rimarily 
residential areas of the City. For further information, see the Potable Water and Sewer Elements of this Comprehensive Plan. 
Many City Departments regularly interact with Florida Power and Light (FPL), which provides 
electric power to the City ; Frontier, which provides telephone service ; and Comcast, the primary 
provider of cable service to the City.  Intergovernmental Coordination   
 
 
 7-13 II. Analysis 
The policies and recommendations in the previous elements of this Comprehensive Plan that 
require sustained and enhanced intergovernmental coordination are briefly discussed below. 
The 1997 Intergovernmental Coordination Element and the 2005 ‘EAR’ 
The City of North Port’s 2005 Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR) stated that there is 
substantial value in all of the ongoing intergovernmental coordination efforts enumerated in the 
goals, objectives and policies of the 1997 version of this Element.  
“Status: The City continues to work cooperatively with the Southwest Florida Regional Planning 
Council and has attended various workshops and committee meetings since the 1997 adoption of the current Comprehensive Plan.  The City monitors the activity of the  Charlotte Harbor 
National Estuary Program but, for various reasons, has not attended many of the meetings of this committee.”  
Although none of the “major issues” identified in the EAR were specific to intergovernmental 
coordination, several of the issues could require intergovernmental coordination, including coordination of mass transit services, water resource- related issues (identifica tion, distribution 
and protection), economic development and the provision of social service facilities and aid in North Port.

Introduction 
 
Adequate housing is one of the key components of a healthy community, and a critical ingredient in the way a community grows.  Therefore, the primary goal of this element is to ensure that a range of housing opportunities and choices are available for current and future City of North Port residents of all income levels and life stages.  This elemen t is supplemented by a Housing Report 
completed by the City in March 2007, which looked at North Port housing in depth.  This report 
presents a history of housing processes and organizations, and supplies valuable demographic and housing stock data.  This element and the Housing Report addresses the data requiremen ts 
pursuant to Florida Statute Chapter 163, and supports the goals and objectives found within the 
Housing Element .  Although the Report is a 2007/2008 document, it was written at the height of 
the housing boom, and as virtually nominal housing development took place during the EAR 
cycle, as the City has recovered, the data and analysis are still relevant to today’s issues and trends.                                                                                               It is vitally important that the Housing Element provide the framework for decision -making by 
all those involved in providing and managing housing within the City.  It  is also essential to 
address the issues likely to arise in the management and coordination of an ever more diverse housing climate.  
 As of 2016, the U.S. Census Bureau and the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and 
Business Research (BEBR) places  North Port’s population at  64,472 residents , surpassing 
Sarasota as the county’s most populous c ity.  North Port is perceived as a blue- collar community 
which could be due in large part to the escalating home prices in other parts of the C ounty whe re 
workforce housing came to the forefront as a major issue. Sarasota County considers North Port 
as its affordable housing area, yet housing costs that may be  considered affordable on a county -
wide basis can be a signif icant burden to many residents of the city. As The West Villages area  
has developed, the district has attracted a different demographic, consisting primarily  of retirees 
and empty -nesters relocating  from other parts of the US . It is hoped that as additional 
development takes place in the West Villages , this area would be able to attract not only retirees                                                                                                                                 Housing Element 
 8-6 but families as well.  For these reasons, the City decided , in 2007, to examine the state of 
housing in North Port as compared to Sarasota County and other surrounding areas. The City 
anticipates updating this document in the near future. 
 As the population of North Port is estimated to nearly dou ble during the next 25 years, it is 
critical to ensure that a safe, enjoyable, and diverse housing stock will be provided for this new 
population, as well as to provide enough flexibility in the housing market to meet the needs of 
residents  and newcomers  of all ages and abilities . Along with these challenges , the City of North 
Port and its residents need to address the condition of the existing housing stock and neighborhoods.  It is also important to understand the presence and needs of cost -burdened 
households throughout the City and to encourage appropriate housing options . This plan should 
be used to assure the effective development of a range of new housing  options on vacant land, 
protection and enhancement of existing residential neighborhoods, and the careful revitalization 
of older urbanized areas to better accommodate the housing needs of North Port’s citizens  while 
recognizing the interaction of housing with other subject areas discussed in this Plan.     
Relationship to the EAR  
 
Of the t hirteen major issues identified in the 2005 Evaluation and Appraisal Report, none were 
directly tied to housing.  In terms of the geographic size of the community, diversifying the housing stock was determined not be a basis for justifying future annexations.  The Affordable Housing Advisory Committee was combined with Urban Neighborhood Advisory Committee for the EAR process.  After several meetings and discussions, the committee listed their major issues and recommendations which are as follows:  
 Create a policy that does not encourage a disproportionate share of low income housing within the City limits.  
 Revitalization of the older ‘original’ platted neighborhoods that have struggled to remain viable. 
 Encourage economic development in order to bring industry , particularly in fields paying 
a higher than average wage,  to North Port, increasing job and wage opportunities in order 
to decrease the need for  City residents  to commute outside the City and southern Sarasota 
County f or employment opportunities. 
 Encourage companies to provide down payment assistance for workforce housing. 
 Expand mass transportation routes for commuters. 
 Encourage the creation of a Community Redevelopment Agency ( CRA ) to broaden the 
focus from US 41 to include adjacent  North Port neighborhoods in need of revitalization. 
 Strengthen policies to ensure minimum square footage requirements for homes. 
 The City of North Port is closely identified with its residential neighborhoods and the feelings of pride and security that those neighborhoods cr eate.  The City and its residents understand the 
challenges that face a platted community, and to that effect expressed preserving and enhancing the character of City neighborhoods through means such as water and sewer expansion, sidewalks, lighting, parks, aesthetics, and identity (signage).                                                                                                                                  Housing Element 
 8-7 Since the development of the 2007 Housing Study, additional issues and trends have arisen that 
the City would look to address  as part of an updated housing study. These issues include, but are 
not limited to: 1) the development of Accessory Dwellings, either as rentable units or for family needs. 2) Multi -generational households, as grandparents are increasingly raising their 
grandchildren or as elderly parents move in with their children’s families; and 3) The recognition as transportation costs as a factor in housing affordability. These issues will be addressed as part of the updated housing study.   Many of the issues addressed by the advisory committee were also findings in the North Port 
Housing Report.  The cost of commuting also has a major impact on housing affordability  and 
the quality of life of City residents  as many workers face long commutes to outlying areas to jobs 
located in areas of the region with higher  housing costs.  According to 2014 On The Map data 
provided by the US Census Bureau, over 90% of North Port workers  commute to locations  
outside of North Port f or employment. While employment opportunities have  increased within 
the City over the last  several years, the majority of these positions have been in the retail  and 
restaurant fields , and is reflective of the City’s growing population. Nearly  all of the regions’ 
higher pay, higher skill  employment opportunities are still located  outside of North Port  in areas 
closer to the traditional regional economic center in northern Sarasota County .  Of the top 20 
employment locations (total employees per 1 square mile) in Sarasota County, none are in North Port.  Data presented in the F uture Land Use Element will illustrate the amount of commercial, 
industrial, and office development currently under review or under construction in North Port.   
Housing in North Port  
 
A. Past & Present Conditions 
 
The history of North Port has much to do with the City’s housing distribution pattern. North Port 
is one of numerous “platted lands communities” that developed i n Florida during the 1950’s and 
1960’s , prior to passage of the State ’s Comprehensive Planning laws .  These types of 
communities are almost completely comprised of single -family residential development, with 
little land set aside for  multi- family housing and non- residential uses.  In North Port’s case, over 
70,000 residential lots were platted during that time period.  Because of the numerous residential lots and the overall lower cost of property and housing in the City  in comparison to Venice or 
northern Sarasota County , it was highly probable that growth would occur.  Similar to many 
platted lands communities in the state, particularly those located at the outer edges of large urb an 
areas  such as Lehigh Acres, Deltona, and Poinciana, North Port’s growth was slow for many 
years.  However, since 2002, the City has been experiencing a population increase from 27,449 to over 64,400 today.  Although much of the City ’s early development focused primarily of on 
retirees , the lower costs of land and housing has also shifted the age demographic as well , 
attracting families priced out of Sarasota and Venice to the City .  In the 1980’s , North Port’s 
median age was close to 60 years of age, today the City has a median age of 41.7 years .  This 
shift affects not only housing needs , but also factors into decisions related to parks and 
recreation , economic development, health care, and education.  
 As the City of North Port matures, it may face challenges in maintaining the residential quality of life. The City must strive to maintain a healthy mix of housing and an available housing stock                                                                                                                                 Housing Element 
 8-8 that is affordable and desirable for its citizens.  According to the Shimberg Center for Affordable 
Housing, in 2013 2013 the City of North Port had 27,986 total housing units, consisting of the 
following:    Single Family Units  24,294 (89.6%) 
Multi- Family Units  1,919 (7.1%) 
Mobile Home Units  907 (3.3%) 
 The 2007 mix of housing in terms of values showed that approximately 41% of the housing stock is affordable, 44% workforce, and 15% market -rate.   While the City has worked to diversify its 
housing stock beyond single family detached platted unit primarily within annexed areas such as 
the Thomas and Kelce Ranches , the single family home remains the primary housing built within 
North Port. With large developments now coming online, the City has begun to notice an 
increase in the construction of town homes  and single family attached  units , carriage homes, and 
villas.  As of 2015, the vast majority (59%) are within the 50- 80% AMI ( Low Income ) range 
seconded by 28% of housing stock at the 30- 50% AMI ( Very L ow Income.)   Although still 
heavy on workforce housing price points , the issues today are similar to what they were in  2007.  
What has drastically changed in the City is  the increase in rent, a reflection of the strong market 
and lack of inventory.  The City has taken steps to increase units with a formalized Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program initiative to aid developer’s in working with City staff and the City Commission to be successful in their applications to the State.  
 
B. Future Housing Development  
 
It is anticipated that, under the current Future Land Use Map, including platted lots, and approved developments, t he City’s p opulation has the potential to exceed 270,000 residents  at 
build-out. In order to house this population, approximately 83,106 total housing units of all types 
will be necessary, or an approximate tripling of  the current housing stock. To add further 
dimensi on to an understanding of the current conditions, it is helpful to look at the distribution of 
housing units in North Port.  The City is the third largest in Florida by land mass and has approximately 43,000 platted lots remaining to be developed.  While the City has made great 
advancement in housing diversification, the dominant type of housing in North Port is  continues 
to be the s ingle family  detached  residence.  
 
In the near future, North Port will see approximately 20,000 additional units in multiple 
developments including the West Villages (Thomas Ranch) and Panacea DRI (Woodlands), which thus far have been developed with higher valued  single family homes  than what ha ve been 
constructed in the platted lands area . While there is land available i n the Northeast quadrant of 
the City,  that, if developed could add another 16,619 housing units of varying types, nearly all of 
this land may be converted into a conservation area through purchase by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) and/ or Sarasota County.  North Port also has eight 
Activity Centers which allow a percentage of high and medium density residential housing to be located in conjunction with commercial, office, and industrial land uses.  For example, the 675 acres of Activity Center 5 will have a mix of commercial, office, public, and medium density residential  uses .  
                                                                                                                                 Housing Element 
 8-9 The presence of a diverse housing stock is critical in order to serve the needs of North Port’s 
labor force  and its current and future residents . Therefore, pre serving and enhancing a variety of 
housing opportunities for citizens is an essential component to this planning effort. Substandard 
and neglected housing reduces property values of entire blocks and neighborhoods. Cost burdened households, spending a high percentage of modest or low incomes on housing, lack the 
resources to buy retail goods offered for sale in the City, affecting all -important sales tax 
revenues. A viable housing market is also important for economic development reasons because prospective employers often choose to locate their enterprises where the workforce is growing.   
Housing Principles  
 
Upon consideration of all relevant social and land use attributes exhibited by the City of North Port, it has been determined that three fundamental housing principles must be addressed in order for the City of North Port to achieve a healthy, vital residential environment that compliments the other commercial, industrial, and recreational areas of the City:  
 
Quality - Ensure that housing is safe, decent, and sanitary; encourage residential design that 
provides a sense of community - friendly and compatible with the neighborhood character. 
Fairness - Promote the preservation and development of a wide range of housing choices that 
provide housing options  for persons of all income levels  and ages  throughout the  City of North 
Port.  
Location - Encourage the development of an appropriate mix of residential land uses throughout 
the City; protect and preserve existing, stable neighborhoods and new residential developments from incompatible adjacent land uses. The opportunity to live, work, and socialize in or near  
one’s own neighborhood contributes to overall affordability.   
Quality of Life  
 
There are several housing and neighborhood issues that North Port must address as it continues to mature and grow. These issues are critical to the community's quality of life as well as its economic development efforts. Following is a discussion of these issues:    
 
A.  Maintenance of Existing Neighborhoods:  Maintaining existing housing and 
neighborhoods in the best possible condition is a primary issue in North Port. Housing in s ome 
areas of the City are aging and showing signs of deterioration. Many of these homes need improvements such as painting, new roofs, plumbing and/or electrical upgrades, and energy 
efficient appliances and heating/air conditioning systems. In many cases, the landscaping , 
driveways, and other exterior features have also not been well -maintained. In addition, many of 
these homes are not desig ned in a way to be optimal for disabled or elderly residents. Many of 
the homes are small in size in comparison to what is currently preferred by potential homebuyers or newer homes that are being built. If the spiraling effect of this deterioration is not addressed in 
a timely manner or homes are not improved to meet the needs of all residents, whole neighborhoods will begin to experience declining values, high turnover of residents, and an overall deterioration in security and the quality of life. These neighborhoods are the backbone of North Port, mainly consisting of homes in the oldest sections of North Port, and are home to a                                                                                                                                 Housing Element 
 8-10 large portion of the City's population. Preserving this housing stock is an important objective. 
Revitalization based on neighborhood plans, along with infill of vacant lands within the urban areas of North Port, may provide new opportunities for economically sustaining existing neighborhoods as well as providing increased housing options.  The Sarasota County Office of Housing & Community Development administers valuable programs for low income residents, including but not limited to rental assistance, revitalization programs, and down payment assistance.  In fact, between  2000 and 2008, over $12 million  in assistance was invested in North 
Port.  
 
B.  Affordable Housing:  Inherent in the concept of preserving existing 
neighborhoods is the preservation of an adequate supply of affordable housing -- that is, housing 
which can be purchased or rented and maintained to a reasonable standar d by persons of low or 
moderate income. For illustrative purposes, affordable housing is defined as the housing 
available for households with an income that is 80% or less of the area median income  (AMI) , 
and that pay no more than 30% of their gross income for housing  or 45% of the combination of 
housing and transportation costs. It is possible to provide decent, code -compliant housing for all 
residents of North Port if all affected parties are willing to devote creative action and some funding to that end. This could mean continued rehabilitation of older single family residence properties, encouragement for developers to renovate existing multiple residence housing stock, the development of affordable multi -family housing in applicable areas of the City, and/or 
incentives for developers to build on in- fill residential properties  (commonly known as Missing 
Middle Housing) rather than on the undeveloped periphery of North Port.   
 
C.  Workforce Housing:   Workforce Housing is oriented toward the middle -income 
workforce that is  employed in all employment sectors, but does not command the income of the 
executive and professional staff. It is important to recognize the need for this more moderate cost, but safe and adequate housing to meet the needs of the workforce. The City of North Port has traditionally provided a significant amount of housing for moderate -income households 
throughout the region. It is important to continue to provide these opportunities, in safe neighborhoods, with services and infrastructure. This type of housing often caters to families with budgetary constraints, but that do not qualify as low income, or between 80 and 120 percent of the region’s AMI. This would include City residents that fill many of the area ’s civil service 
fields.  
 
D.  Medium & High Density Housing:   The City recognizes the need to provide 
adequate housing choices for all segments of its population. Multiple residence housing plays a critical role in accommodating persons of all economic classes  and life stages , but is often a 
preferred housing option for those of moderate means , for residents just out of school , or for 
older adults without children at home . Multiple -residence housing plays an important role in the 
City's economic growth because it serves employees  of many North Port businesses who live and 
shop in the City. Such housing also plays an important role in attracting new industry and retaining existing businesses in North Port. However, these properties can deteriorate quickly without proper management and maintenance. The City should require new multiple residence communities to meet standards of quality and design which will maintain the City's valuable rental housing stock for the future needs of North Port citizens  while also being built in a way 
that limits additional utility costs to its residents .                                                                                                                                 Housing Element 
 8-11  
E.  Master Planned Housing and Mixed Use Developments :  Master 
planned developments , such as the West Villages , Panacea,  and Heron Creek , usually include 
large tracts of land that have special privately operated and maintained amenities (that are either 
as part of a homeowners’ association or as a membership facility that outside residents may join)  
that often appeal to higher income households while serving to differentiate these communities 
from other a reas of the City. These amenities may include parks, play areas, clubhouse facilities, 
and golf courses . In most cases, these communities are gated.  The annexed areas provide the 
best opportunity for developing such communities, although some developers have assembled 
and re -platted older platted areas to create master planned communities.  This type of land 
assembly should continue to be encouraged.  Having master planned subdivisions is a major element in economic development, as they can be a primary means of providing the range of housing that suits the needs of the executive and higher income employees of existing and newly locating employers, as well as centers of commercial and office development. Homes in m aster  
planned communities tend to have higher value, on average, because of the amenities offered. The restrictions placed on property use , the presence of an active homeowner ’s association,  and 
higher maintenance requirements  serve to  keep the subdivisions in excellent physical conditi on. 
As North Port continues to rapidly grow, opportunities to develop large, master planned mix use areas are being lost  as single family lots are developed in a piecemeal manner in the platted 
areas .   
 
F.  Manufactured Homes:   The City has one manufactur ed home park and 
approximately 919 manufactured homes which accounts for 3 percent of the City's housing 
stock. This long established park (Holiday Park along US 41) is restricted to persons of 55 years of age or older. The availability of these affordable properties is an asset to lower income households. However, there is a greater probability that older mobile homes will deteriorate 
physically faster than conventionally built housing , due to much of this housing being occupied 
by older residents that  may not be physically able to work on their homes or lower income 
residents that may not have the financial resources to maintain their homes.   
G.  Adult Care Centers:   The need for geographic balance should be recognized in 
the location of Adult Care Ce nters and similar facilities. The City should consider the 
development of policies to address the issues of geographic balance and the potential neighborhood impacts of these facilities . An alternative to this may be in allowing for a greater 
utilization o f elder cottages and med cottages, manufactured accessory dwellings that would tie 
into the existing homes water and sewer/septic service and would serve a family member that can still live somewhat independently but would be required to be removed once th at family 
member no longer lives in the home. These homes would serve to lower the long term cost of care for residents that may other have to live in an Adult Care facility and would serve to improve the quality of life for these residents.   
2007 North P ort Housing Report  
 
As numerous Florida communities were making national headlines, including Sarasota County, in terms of escalating housing prices during the housing boom, affordable and workforce housing                                                                                                                                 Housing Element 
 8-12 came to the forefront as a serious concern.  With every seminar or workshop, experts discussed 
avenues that governments can take to address this topic.  In the fall of 2006, staff analyzed  the 
housing situation in  North Port, and compare d data such as values, prices, and employment 
opportunities with surrounding areas.  This effort became the 2007 North Port Housing Report. 
The Shimberg Center was a tremendous benefit in terms of data, although at the time of the report, was showing a population far below actual numbers, in fact the City was almost 10 yea rs 
ahead of projections.  The Shimberg Center work ed with Planning staff to update the population 
projections in order get closer figures in terms of future need and demand.   While these issues were major concerns during the housing boom (and many of these issues, particularly the limited availability of affordable housing and the limited supply of multi- family 
housing within the City continues to have an effect on decision making at the City level) the City continues to recover from the rapid devaluat ion of City properties in the wake of the housing 
bubble bursting in 2007. Even today, housing values remain at roughly three -quarters of the 
housing prices that were in place at the peak of the housing bubble.  The North Port Housing Report has been presented and received favorably by the North Port 
Planning & Zoning Board, the North Port Economic Development Advisory Committee, City Management Team, and on public TV.

I. Executive Summary 
 
 All segments of the housing market, from low to high priced, are important for the economic and social sustainability of the City.  Providing quality housing for people of all inco me levels is 
an integral component of smart growth, as no single type of housing can serve the different needs of today’s increasingly diverse households.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that the housing types are well balanced. Limiting housing types precludes opportunities for the workforce that serves our community. Housing is the largest land use in the community, the largest capital asset, 
and is a major source of revenue in the form of property taxes.  To be clear, housing affordability is a relative concept.  When inquiring about affordability, it is necessary to ask the question; affordable with respect to what?  It has been suggested that attempting to measure housing prices with some type of median or similar measure may be misleading.  The r elevant question is whether housing is available within the price ranges that 
local citizens/employees can reasonably afford.    For the purposes of this report, housing is divided into three  major categories; affordable , 
workforce, and market rate housing. The category of affordable housing is further divided into 
three  subcategories; extremely low, very low, and low .  Workforce is divided into two 
subcategories:  moderate, and near market. Market rate housing has one subcategory of Market. 
This report anal yzes the existing conditions of housing in North Port and projects the anticipated 
state of housing at the City’s build -out.  Based on the data and analysis contained in this report, 
the following summarizes the conclusions.    The City of North Port, as part of the Comprehensive Plan update, will continue to make and/or improve upon policies to endorse and support developer and non- profit initiatives to provide a 
balance of units to those who work and serve our community, aiding in the transition from one level of housing to the next.  PROJECTIONS  
 1.   The Shimberg Center for Affordable Housing, the State’s authority on housing, reports that an ideal mix of housing should be equally distributed. At build- out, the City is 
projected to have 45% market rate, 30% affordable, and 25% workforce. This is due to the recent annexations, where staff anticipates the majority of the housing to be market rate. This is quite close to the Shimberg Center guideline.   
 
 
RECOMMENDATION:  The City’s should monitor the housing mix  (sales price, values, 
types, and location)  every two years.   Significant variances from the trends and 
assumptions illustrated in this report should prompt a re -examination of the housing 
stock .  Monitoring housing stock is a critical factor because it is difficult to forecast 
economic conditions such as migration patterns, demographic changes, housing interest 
rates, construction costs and more.   
  
 
Page 7 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
2. The city is comprised of mainly two groups, young families and retirees.  The trend of 
younger families is also evident with projections showing that the city will have a population predominan tly younger than 54 years old by 2011.  In contrast, future 
projections illustrate a slight reduction of all age groups, with a significant increase in 55 -
74 age gr oup by 2025.  This age group will make up 33% of the age demographic in the 
city.   
 
RECOMMENDATION:  The projected increase in 55 -74 year olds by 2025, as well as 
the high percentage of 0- 19 year olds illustrates the necessity of additional health care 
facilities, including a hospital.  Based on age projections, the city should continue seeking 
the means to expand health care opportunities for residents.  The presence of health care 
options for North Port citizens is an important component in the quality of  life for present 
and future populations.  
 
This change in demographics should also drive changes in the need for housing, commercial business, jobs, and driving patterns (commuting) .  In terms of city services, 
these demographics should be reflected in th e Capital Improvement Plan in terms of 
recreation, educational facilities, and social services.  
3.   Based on the build -out projections, the City has met the 1997 goal to diversify the 
housing stock.   
 
RECOMMENDATION:  Unless the monitoring mentioned above shows that the housing stock is or will be out of balance, the goal to diversify the housing stock should not be the basis for justifying future annexation, except the US-41 corridor. 
 
EXISTING CONDITIONS  
 
4.  S ixty-three  percent of the existing housing inventory is valued workforce low and 
workforce moderate (household incomes from $29,000 to $58,400). 
 
RECOMMENDATION: The City has ample units that fall within the work force low, 
work force moderate, and community near market subcategories. The two- year 
monitoring report may change this recommendation.  The city should look into developing policies that would incorporate a small percentage of workforce units into future market level  developments. 
 5.  Nine percent of the housing inventory falls into the extremely low to very low subcategories (household incomes from $0 to $29,200). There is a need for additional units within this subcategory. 
 
RECOMMENDTIONS:  There are at least three  options to consider that would address 
this issue.   
• Require apartments  to be constructed over commercial businesses.  
• Allow apartments, such as garage apartments, within single family neighborhoods provided the lot is at least ½ acre and that these units are dispersed throughout the  
 
Page 8 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
neighborhood to ensure that the units are not concentrated in one area, which 
would negatively impact the neighborhood.   
• Continue with the CDBG programs such as the down payment assistance 
program. As new programs become available, the City should explore the 
opportunities and become involved in the appropriate programs.   
 
6.   Fifteen percent of the housing stock is in the Market subcategory (housing incomes exceeding $ 70,000). 
 
RECOMMENDATION:  Although it is anticipated that this percentage will increase with the development of the recently annexed areas (Thomas Ranch and the Kelce Ranch), this aspect of the City’s housing inventory should be included in the two- year monitoring 
report.   
 
7.   The reported incidences of homeless people within the City are very low.   
RECOMMENDATION:  Until supp ort facilities such as medical, educational, and social 
services are available, the City should not encourage programs that attract this segment of society. RECOMMENDATION:  The City should participate in programs that prevent homelessness such as temporar y financial support and education.   
 
8.   The City’s mixture of housing subcategories is balanced with a few exceptions. The Estates area and golf course communit ies contain predominately Market rate housing, 
while the older neighborhoods along US -41 and Biscayne B oulevard contain work force 
very low and work force low housing.  The city should continue discussions with 
Sarasota County regarding the formation of Community Redevelopment A reas (CRA).  
 
RECOMMENDATION:  The City should develop land use regulations that ensure the new housing developments contain a mixture of housing subcategories.   
 
     9.  The distribution of land use patter ns in Sarasota C ounty and North P ort has created  a 
situation where workers are commuting to jobs.  This is having an im pact on the local 
transportation system, and the quality of life of those who have to make these trips.  
 
RECOMMENDATION: The city should continue to make every effort to attract business 
that offer higher income jobs  which diversi fy the tax base and provide workers 
opportunities to work within the community. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: In addition, the city and county should work together to re -
distribute economic development opportunities to the South, where the future concentration of the workforce population will reside . 
 
     10.  The city should ensure that multi -family complexes including those in the affordable 
range integrate and enhance neighborhoods.

RECOMMENDATION: M ulti-family apartment buildings should have  design standards 
which include porches, patios , balconies, and common gardens.  These a menities directly 
tie to quality of life for those in the units.   
 
Staff presents the following report as a means to b ring the citizens of North Port into discussions 
concerning this issue. As the desires of the citizens become clear, the Comprehensive Plan, Goals, Objectives, and Policies will be modified to ensure the citizens’ desires for their city and neighborhoods are implemented. The recommendations above are by no means the end result.

II. Introduction  
 
Housing is crucial to shaping the way communities grow, as it constitutes a significant share of new construction and development.  Housing is also a key factor in determining access to transportation, commuting patterns , access to services and education, and consumption of fuel.  
By using smart growth approaches to create a wider range of housing choices, communities can mitigate the environmental costs of auto -dependent development, use infrastructure resources 
more efficiently, ensure a better job  to housing balance, and generate a strong foundation of 
support for neighborhood transit stops.

 The history of North Port has much to do with the housing distribution pattern of the city.  North 
Port is one of the “platted lands” communities that developed around the s tate in the 1950’s and 
60’s.  These types of community land use patterns relied predominantly on residential development, with little land set aside for non- residential uses.  In North Port’s case, over 70,000 
residential lots were platted during that time period.  Because of the numerous residential lots and 
the overall lower cost of property and housing in the city, it was inevitable that growth would 
occur.   The question, which is common to platted communities, is when will the growth ‘spurt’ 
occur.  In North Port ’s case, growth was slow for many years.  However, since 2002, the city has 
been experiencing a population increase from  27,449
2 to approximately 50,000 residents today.  
In a cyclical effect, retail development is following the influx of new residents, making the area even more attractive for potential new residents.  However, the c ity ha s yet to see a great influx 
in professional and industrial facilities to complement the large and growing workforce population in North Port.    Previously, the city was out of balance with approximately 95% residential land use and only 5% 
of the city’s l and area was left unplatted.  These unplated areas are called activity centers in the 
city’s Comprehensive Plan and offer the greatest areas for economic diversification and housing diversification in the originally platted areas.  Although activity center s will afford the land for

these vital land use components, p rofessional planning studies have shown that sustainable 
communities needed 15 -17% of its total land area devoted to non- residential uses.  Since a ctivity 
centers only comprised approximately 5% of the c ity’s land area, r ecent voluntary annexations 
have increased that percentage to approximately 13%, just under the c ity’s goal of 17%, thereby 
decreasing the potential of remaining a bedroom community and also increasing financial 
sustainability .   
 
To define and then implement the correct balance of all market segments is the goal of the Housing Chapter through the Comprehensive Plan update per Florida Statute 163.3177 (6) (f) and Rule 9J5 of the Florida Administrative Code.  This report will presen t the data and analysis 
to better understand the existing opportunities and challenges in addressing housing of all types.  Through these opportunities and challenges, this report will make findings that will become the basis for changes to the city’s goal s, objectives, and policies in the Comprehensive Plan.    After 
the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan, programs will be developed, and codes will be changed to implement these goals, objectives, and policies.   
III.   Community Composition 
 Sarasota Count y municipalities have a variety of differences; natural features, historical 
development patterns, infrastructure capacities, employment opportunities, and community attitudes regarding growth.  These distinctions shape each community’s special character. As a consequence, each jurisdiction has a different proportion and mix of the region’s existing housing supply and encounters dissimilar market segments of the region’s total housing demand.    Residents and local planning policies and regulations fashion these differences into a community 
identity.

 One way to enhance planning efforts is to look at the socioeconomic and demographic composition of the city’s neighborhoods.  A Community Tapestry
™ tool prepared by ESRI,3 is

used by Sarasota County to provide a detailed description of census tracts ( Exhibit A ) throughout 
the county.  The profile of North Port as shown in Figure 3.1  supports the findings that the city is 
made up of two spectrums, young families and retirees.  This has not always been the case.  
North Port was originally settled by retirees from the N ortheast and Midwest.   
 The ESRI program used for the tapestry profile also estimate s and project s population by age 
category .
4  These projections illustrate that in  2011 the city will be made up of the following age 
groups: 26.4% of residents will be 0-19 years old  
17.2% of residents will be 20-34 years old 27.8% of residents will be 35 -54 years old 
18.2% of residents will be 55-74 years old 10.4% of residents will be 75 years and older  The only notable difference from 2006 to 2011 is a 2.4% increase in 45 -54 age segment  and the 
matching decrease in 35 -44 age segment  by 2.5% .   
 This shift is also notable with the Shimberg Cente r for Affordable Housing population 
projections thru 2025
5.  In a comparison  of ages from the 2000 census to 2025 projections, 
another shift in ages takes place.  A significant inc rease in the 55 -74 age group is shown below: 
 23% of residents will be 0 -19 years old  
15% of residents will be 20- 34 years old  
23% of residents will be 35- 54 years old  
33% of residents will be 55- 74 years old  
6% of residents will be 75 years and older  
 
Findings:   The ‘Tapestry’ of North Port illustrates that this is a community predominantly made 
up of two distinct populations, young families and retirees. The senior population is 
predominantly concentrated in the older neighborhoods South of US 41, including Holiday Park. 
Retirees are also predominantly concentrated in the older Salford–Sumter area spreading W est.  
The young families are locating from Salford Blvd. to the East. The trend of younger families is 
also evident with ESRI projections showing that the city will have a population predominately 
younger than 54 years old by 2011.  This change in demographics drives changes in the need for 
housing, recreation, educational facilities, commercial business, jobs, social services, and driving pat terns (commuting).  In contrast, future projections illustrate a slight reduction of all 
age groups, with a significant increase in 55- 74 age group. This significant increase, as well as 
the high percentage of 0 -19 year olds illustrates the necessity of ad ditional health care facilities , 
including a hospital .  The presen ce of health care options for North Port citizens is an important 
component in the quality of life  for present and future populations.

IV.   Key Issue  
 
Affordable Housing  
The term “affo rdable housing” is no longer just a euphemism for low -income, subsidized 
projects or large mobile home parks.  Many recent graduates and other s new to the workplace, as 
well as police officers, firefighters, school teachers, retail workers and others canno t afford to 
live in the communities where they work.   
 Low-income households often have a great difficulty finding adequate housing that can 
accommodate their needs within their financial means and can actually become isolated from 
economic opportunities
6.  In most housing segments, when housing prices increase faster than 
wages, where do workers live?  Increasingly, Florida communities and businesses are expressing concern about a shortage of workforce housing; apartments and housings that are affordable for workers in low to moderately paid jobs.  Some characteristics of the workforce housing shortage  
include:
7 
   Communities may have difficulty attracting public service workers, such as teachers, nurses, 
firefighters, and police officers, because there is little housing these employees can afford.  
   New business may be reluctant to come to a community with limited affordable housing, and 
existing businesses may find it difficult to expand and add employees.    Workers may face long commutes from outlying areas with more affordable housing to jobs 
located in cities with high housing costs.    People with low -paying jobs, such as cashiers and home health aids, may have trouble 
finding any housing they can afford close to employment opportunities.  To be  clear, housing affordability is a relative concept.  When inquiring about affordability, it is 
necessary to ask the question; affordable with respect to what?  It has been suggested that attempting to measure housing prices with some type of median or sim ilar measure may be 
misleading.    
Finding:   The relevant question throughout this document is whether housing is available within 
the price ranges that local citizens/employees can reasonably afford.

As a result  of a 2003- 2005 escalation in growth , the trendlines and methodology used by the 
Shimberg Center for Affordable Housing9 were  lower than actual figures.  Due to the surge in

permits for these two years, Shimberg updated North Port’s population projections in order to 
give a more accurate measure for the Comprehensive Plan update and this report.  Since building permits for 2005- 2006 are now more consistent with original analysis, Shimberg data will be 
utilized throughout this study and the  Comprehensive Plan update, unless otherwise indicated.

Findings:   The city has experienced a steady grow th pattern from 1996 to 2000.  Housing 
growth showed  two peak years from 2003- 2005.  There were more building permits from 2003 -
2005 than 1996-2003 combined.    
Households  
 
North Port has seen its population increase more than 
50%  over the past five years  (2000-2005), 
adding just over 12,000 residents and doubling its housing stock by 10,180 homes according to 
the most recent Sarasota County Property Appraisers  data .10   
 
The driving force behind this change may be the availability of land and lower housing costs as  
compared to surrounding areas, quality of life factors such as a new middle and high school, plus two new e lementary schools all within the last 5 year period .  Growth will likely remain strong in 
coming years, as platted lots and new developments such as Bobcat Trail, Heron Creek, West 
Villages, and the Panacea DRI continue to develop.   Figure 5.2 illustrates  population projections 
in the City of North Port from 2005-2030
11 by the Shimberg Center for Affordable Housing.  
 
In comparison, the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR), forecasts a population of 93,693 by 2030 using a medium projection and 137,020 using a high 
projection.  Figures from multiple sources are helpful in showing medium and high population

Findings:   Although population projections are going to differ depending on methodology, the 
steady trend of building permits corresponds with the population projections provided by  both  
the Shimberg Center for Affordable Housing and BEBR.  BEBR projects s teady growth thru 
2030 ,with  a slightly higher rate of growth  than Shimberg.   
Size o f Households12 
According to 2005 household projections from the Shimberg Center for Affordable Housing, 
using the  updated population projections, North Port has approximately 16,531 households  
(planning staff finds 21,786 households based on Sarasota County Property Appraiser data and 
an apartment count).  This represents an increase from the 9,111 households identified in the 2000 census and is another indicator of the city’s recent growth.  Furthermore, in 1980 the number of people per household was 2.24, in 1990  it was  2.33, and today 2.48.  This data shows 
a trend towards larger family households.   
With a median age of 50.5 years (2000), Sarasota County’s population is the third oldest in the 
state following Charlotte and Citrus County and is substantially older than Florida’s median age of 38.7.  Correspondingly, North Port’s median age is the lowest in the county at 41.4.  In addition, North Port has the highest percentage (23.3%) of people under 18 in the county.

The following data was derived from the previous 2005 population projections and has yet to be 
updated, although it is expected that the percentages will remain consistent.

7,833 households in North Port (62%) are made up of 1- 2 persons in 2005. 24% of these 
households pay more than 30% of income for rent or mortgage costs.  
3,590 households in North Port (29%) are made up of 3- 4 persons in 2005. 22% of these 
households pay more than 30% of income for rent or mortgage costs.  
1,162 households in North Port (9%) are made up of 5 persons or more in 2005. 25% of these 
households pay more than 30% of income for rent or mortgage costs.  
Findings:   As expected with the city’s growth, the number of hous eholds has continued to 
increase by 7,000-12,000 in a five year period , depending on the source .  Als o, the number of 
people per  households has increased to 2.48, indicating an increase in families, which is evident 
with over 23% of residents under the age of 18. Correspondingly, data shows 38% of households 
have more than three persons and 62% with 1- 2 persons.  
Tenure  
The homeownership rate in 2002 for the city was 88.0%  as illustrated in Figure 5.3 . Statewide, 
Florida's homeownership rate is 70.0%.  This percentage of ownership is forecasted to remain 
consistent through 2025.14 In 2000, the vacancy rate was 2.8%, when seasonal units are included, 
the percentage increases to 11.6%.   Vacancy rates are a factor impacting the housing market and 
affordability . Vacant units are vital to a healthy housing market because they help maintain 
stable prices.  An insuf ficient number of vacant units create upward pressure on prices as 
housing consumers compete for too few units .15  In the affordable housing sector, upward price 
movements reduce the supply of units, working against housing policy and public investment in affordable housing.  In contrast, too many homes for sale, property flipping, and investor 
initiatives, can reduce home prices until the inventory is more balanced.  This phenomenon was 
evident in SW Florida with  the ‘housing boom’ of 2005.

The effect of the older population of Sarasota County and its attraction as a seasonal destination 
is reflected in the housing inventory with lower percentages of owner -occupied and lower 
average household sizes in Venice and Longboat Key as compared to North Port, the City of Sarasota, and unincorporated Sarasota County .
16  Table 5.1 shows a summary of the increase of 
owner occupied households and pe ople per household increases, as the median age decreases (in 
1970 there were no multi -family or apartment units available, hence the high percentage of 
ownership).        Table 5.1

Findings:   Homeowners hip in North Port has increased  overall since the 1980’s and 1990’s, 
and is currently  higher than the state average.  Vacancy rates appear to be decreasing as well . 
(coastal counties must account for a  percentage of seasonal non-permanent residents, theref ore 
vacancy rates are significantly lower during season) .  More housing choices such as condo’s, 
town homes, and duplexes, along with good market conditions are an indicator of the high 
percentage of ownership in the city.  This data is an indicator that t he city is seeing 
diversification in the housing stock. 
 
Types of Housing  
Most of the occupied housing units found in North Port are single -family detached homes.  This 
is mainly a reflection of the platted lands nature of city land use, where a single -family detached 
dwelling unit is the primary permitted housing type. However, changing prefere nces and the 
desire for lower- maintenance living are reflected in recently completed and upcoming 
developments offering single -family attached units, villa’s, and town  homes.   In addition, 
through the Evaluation and Appraisal Report (EAR) process, citizens encouraged land-uses for 
town homes, condo’s and duplexes in order to encourage homeownership.17

Findings:   The landscape of North Port is still dominated by single family detached homes.  In 
fact, 88% of North Port’s housing stock is  single family homes .  Recent annexations and higher 
density allowances in activity centers are allowing the city to diversi fy the housing stock, giving 
citizens more variety to fit with incomes, lifestyles, and employment needs, as opposed to the 
single family home.  Several upcoming developments will  further this trend b y offering other 
types of units such as single family attached, villa’s and condo’s.  Although the number of multi -
family units are increasing dramatically, mobile homes have seen a decline. 
 
Substandard Housing Conditions  
Housing units are considered to be substandard if they are overcrowded, do not have heat, or lack complete kitchens or plumbing. In 2000,
18  
245 housing units (2.7% of all units) in North Port were overcrowded, meaning that they housed 
more than one person per room, compared to a statewide percentage of 6.5%.  
19 units (0.2%) in North Port did not use home heating fuel, compared to a statewide percentage 
of 1.8%.  (the warm climate does not make this an issue)  
18 units (0.2%) in North Port lacked complete kitchen facilities, compared to a s tatewide 
percentage of 0.5%.  
0 units (0.0%) in North Port lacked complete plumbing facilities, compared to a statewide 
percentage of 0.4%.  
Findings:   By all indicators, North Port does not have a major issue with substandard housing.  
This is a reflection on the relative ‘newness’ of the housing stock.

Age of Housing Stock 
 
The age of housing stock is one indicator used to a ssess the housing condition and level of 
housing nee d within a community.  Older housing often requires much more maintenance and 
can frequently have extensive rehabilitation needs.  It may  also be a t risk of substandard 
plumbing/electrical facilities.  State building requirements have changed substantially since North 
Port became a city in 1959.    Most older housing units are concentr ated in the original ‘core’ of the city. Using 2000 Census 
data, Table 5.3 shows that  41% of North Ports housing stock was built after 1990 (by adding 
units from 2000- 2005, 70% of all city units were built after 1990).  In contrast, l ess than 1,200 
units a re older than 1970. During the Evaluation and Appraisal Report meetings, c itizens 
expressed a need for more revitalization efforts and more frequent monitoring of dilapidated units, not just during the update of the Comprehensive Plan.

Findings:     Th e city has a predominately newer housing stock, with just 37 units considered 
substandard in terms of kitchen and plumbing facilities .  Most  older units are concentrated in the 
older area of the city. Frequent monitoring and revitalization efforts may be necessary.

The correlation between the average s ales prices for North Port, Sarasota County, and even 
Charlotte County respectively  shows a powerful difference . Figure 6.1 demonstrate s the 
comparison of s ales prices for 2004 (partial year) and shows this  noteworthy difference.  There is 
a $61,000 difference from North Port to Charlotte County and $158,000 to Sarasota County.

Because 2004 sales prices are  the most curr ent available data from Shimberg, staff performed  a 
limited survey of recent home sales.20  From that survey, 73 % of sales were in a range of a 
person or persons earning 120% of the area median income ( AMI ) of $58,400 for a family of 
four, and below  (with 6% sold at 80% AMI or lower), and 21% were higher income homes.  A 
description of housing types and affordability will follow in the next section.  Note: only 1 home sold for under $100,000 during the 60 day period.  T he average sales price for the 89 homes used 
in this MLS survey was $189,940, or an average of $42,345 more than prices in 2004.   
 Although this figure shows the evident upward slant of prices over the last couple years, it also 
shows North Port prices remain less than those in nearby communit ies as shown  in Figure 6.1 .  
Unmistakably, each upward shift in the market leaves homeownership out of reach for more and more households. 
Even by current trends, using $189,940 average sales price, citizens are still purchasing property 
for less than surr ounding communities. I n North Port, $245,929 was the average list price for the 
week of 1/25-1/31 2007, according to Trulia real estate search.   
Table 6.1 gives a framework of wages versus average housing costs in the Sarasota -Bradenton 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) , with a median single family sales price of $255,000.  The 
table shows the percentage of the selected occupations wages that would be spent on a mortgage.

From this table it is clear that a single wage earner in these selected categories would be unable 
to purchase a home in the metropolitan statistical area, median price of $255,000 unless there is an additional, higher  wage earner in the household.  Exhibit B  shows multiple occupations and 
the corresponding regional wages.  This illustration shows affordability when two differing occupations live in the same household.  Although multiple low wage ear ners will still struggle 
to afford a unit, these workers increase their ability to afford a unit depending on the income level of the other working household members.   
Findings :  North Port has a significantly  lowe r average sales price thru 2004 as compared to 
selected counties/municipalities  which  may account for the rapid population increase in the city 
and may also explain the commuting patterns of workers as well. For those in low pay 
occupations, homeownership is out of reach for many depending on the  number of wage earners 
and their cumulative income. Affordability increases when differing income level workers share 
the housing expense , but not for all categories.  
Values  
In previous sections, much of the data was in a historical or regional context.  This section, with 
the exception of a regional value’s  table, is more North Port specific.  For this report, housing 
includes three general types;  
 
• Affordable Housing:  Housing which monthly rents including utilities , or monthly 
mortgage payments including property taxes and insurance , do not exceed 30- 35% of that 
amount which represents the percentage of the area median annual income for the 
households making less than 80 percent of the area median income , calibrated to 
household size. 
 
• Workforce Housing :  Housing, regardless of tenure, which is affordable housing to 
households earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of the Area Median Income, calibrated to household size.  
  
 
Page 22 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
There is no nationally agreed upon definition of workforce housing. Many munici palities 
around the nation have adopted varying definitions for workforce housing to address 
particular demographic trends in their communities. Workforce housing is generally defined as housing that is affordable to those households whose occupants earn between 60 and 140 percent of an area’s median income.   
 
• Market Housing:   Housing, regardless of tenure, which is affordable to those earning 
120% of the Area Median Income or more.

In Table  6.2, using income and housing costs calculations provided by Sarasota County Planning 
& Development services, the following categori es illustrate  at each income level, how many 
North Port units through 2005, are valued in a range that would be affordable to the 
corresponding income level for a family of four.    
To illustrate: a family with a yearly income of $35,000 or 60% AMI, spending no more than 35% 
of their income would have $1,022 available for housing.  This family would fall into ‘low’ income category.  They could afford a home between $96,207- $153,864.  The table below 
illustrates that there are 6,990 homes valued in this range and 121 condominiums.  
 
* due to market deviations, the ‘value’ data set is used for this table. An assumption of an additional 14% to each value would be 
close to a market rate.

Marketconcentrations of equivalent home values.  The platted area of the city revea ls a good mix of low 
to market valued units.  The extremely low-very low units are clustered in the mobile home park. 
From Table 6.2 and Exhibit C , the data clearly 
shows that 41% of North Port homes are 
valued in the affordable price category of 0-
80% AMI.  Also, there are 44% workforce housing units in the 80 -120% AMI, leaving 
15% of homes valued at or above marke t.  
From this data, Figure 6.2 illustrates the 
current housing mix based on value .  In 
contrast,  Figure 6.3 shows the projected  
housing mix at build out , using 
documentation from upcoming large scale 
developments including the West Villages, Panacea, HMTA, and Largo.                          
In comparison, Table 6.3 shows average single family home value s as compared to other cities 
and counties in the region.  Port St. Lucie was added as a similar platted lands community.  As 
an added note, local governments throughout the region have tended to use N orth P ort’s 
affordability  to satis fy its housing requirements  for D evelopments of Regional I mpact’ s (DRI’s).  
This practice has allowed other communities to exacerbate the gap between higher end 
developments in their communities, and affordable areas elsewhere. This data also confirms that 
homes in North Port are valued lower than most in the region, even though Sarasota County is ranked as one of the highest out of all 67 counties in the state in terms of values, with an average single family home value of $222,909.

In Figure 6.4, as in Exhibit C which looked at just the City of North Port, looks at Sarasota 
County as a whole.  This figure illustrates the amount of housing valued in different segments 
per cities or unincorporated Sarasota County.  It also shows that the City of Sarasota has the majority of subsidized housing units in the county.  To see all housing units by color and area, see Appendix Map 1. 
       
      Figure 6.4 
 
 
 
Findings:  North Port has a high percentage of homes valued at and selling at  workforce income 
levels.  At this current  trend, the city would be highly out of balance in terms of mixed home 
values .  It is evident that the forthcoming development of annexed areas in  the city will assist in 
brining a more diverse mix of home types and prices that would have not have been pos sible  
 
Page 25 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
otherwise. Although it is anticipated that new developments will have values at or above market 
levels unless a percentage of workforce units are integrated into the plans.  
  
In addition, newer homes constructed on platted lots throughout the city will have higher price  
points than previous years and will increase in value.  With these findings, North Port, as 
compared to other cities within the county, is bridging the  gap in affordability within the county.  
Through the EAR process, citizens have exp ressed concern regarding disproportionate shares of 
housing in low income categories in North Port, although workforce housing was a desired 
income level unit .22 As shown in Appendix Map 1 and Figure 6.4, there is a good mix of housing 
values in the cities,  and the connecting areas of unincorporated Sarasota County, west of I 75, 
however, there is a large amount of higher end housing to the East of I 75.   Strategies should be implemented to ensure a healthy amount of hous ing for all income 
categories. Bi- yearly monitoring of housing stock and trends would ensure that the  market , in 
conjunction with approved strategies, are producing units to meet the needs of each income 
category from 0 -120% AMI .
23  Housing stock for those in income levels above 120% AMI shou ld 
also be monitored to ensure an adequate  mix.  Sustainability of commercial development, and 
the housing market vs . available jobs , is contingent on a healthy balance of housing stock  or the 
need for more units.    
VII.  Rental Housing  
 
Each year, the Departm ent of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) publishes a list of Fair 
Market Rents (FMR).  The FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to pay the gross rent (shelter, plus cost of utilities, except telephone) of privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing at a modest, non- luxury nature with suitable amenities.  The 2006 FMR 
for the Sarasota -Bradenton MSA are as follows
24: 
 
0-Bedrooms 1-Bedroom 2-Bedroom 3-Bedroom 4-Bedroom 
$625  $685  $824  $1,052  $1,156 
 Figure 7.1 shows minimum rents for a two bedroom apartment in several North Port apartment 
communities.  Toledo Club apartment s are  the only fair market rate apartments in North Port  
with rents from $685-$1,065 which serve a range of households from very- low to moderate 
incomes (mini mum income of $24,660-$38,340).  With 345 units, Toledo Club rents are 
consistent with the HUD’s list of FMR.

A minimum wage earner (earning $6.15  per hour) working full time can afford monthly rent of 
no more than $320.  That equates to  173 work hours to afford a two- bedroom unit at the fair 
market rent , if there is only one wage earner.  Low wage earners are generally assisted by federal 
and state  programs administered through Sarasota County as noted in section VIII . According to 
the U .S. Dept. of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics , retail and administrative related jobs pay on 
average approximately $7.93- $11.87.  These two categories employ a larg e percentage of 
workers in the Sarasota-Bradenton- Venice Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) .25  
 In absence of additional income, full time wage earners in these jobs do not have the income to 
afford a unit at fair market rent.  Furthermore, a graphic by the Florida TaxWatch (E xhibit D) 
shows that an estimated 47% of Sarasota County renters  are unable to afford median 2 bedroom 
apartments at fair market rate.    
 
 Table  7.1 shows a select ion of occupations, and how much rent these workers could afford 
based on area salaries.  For example: a retail salesperson could not afford a two bedroom fair 
market rate unit with no other source of income.  Half the experienced workers could afford a unit, the other half must have an alternate form of income, a working roo mmate or spouse, reside 
in tax -credit units, and/or utilize federal housing assistance programs.

Renting vs . Homeownership:  
Depending on a households  situation, homeownership may not always be the best financial 
choice, or even an option.  Renting can offer surprising benefits.  Below are several of the top 
homeownership myths, including28: 
Myth: I'll reduce my tax bill if I buy a house.  
Reality: A majority of homeowners reap no annual tax benefits from owning a house. 
Myth: Paying rent is throwing away money. 
Reality: For the first five years of homeownership, you are simply giving away your money to a 
bank. Nearly one-third of all buyers move within five years, before they start building any real equity. 
Myth: My mortgage payment will be less than my rent.  
Reality: Your mortgage payment is just the beginning. The ""hidden costs"" of home ownership can 
add up to thousands of dollars a year , such as insurance and maintenance. 
Myth: As a home owner, my housing costs will stay constant. I won't have to worry about 
rent increases.  
Reality: Your mortgage may remain constant, but other costs, such as maintenance, insurance 
and property taxes can change significantly every year. And if you have an adjustable- rate 
mortgage, your mortgage payment itself can increase. 
Myth: Investing in a house is a safe investment.  
Reality: Even in today’s healthy housing market, stocks and bonds often still offer a better 
return.

Findings:   As fair market rents increase, lower income jobs and households on fixed incomes 
find it difficult to afford fair market rents and even assisted/subsidized rents .  As 
commercial/office development continue s to rise in North Port, many of the associated jobs are 
not at the income level to afford fair market housing with one wage earner .  Multiple wage 
earner households, as shown in the dual occupation table Exhibit B , illustrates a higher rate of 
affordabili ty with dual incomes for those other than the extremely low income category.   
Economic development initiatives for professional, industrial, medical and other higher income 
uses would complement a broader spectrum of employment choices.   In most cases, e ven an experienced single worker cannot afford a fair market unit.  When more 
than one wage earner contributes to the household income, affordability for a median-experienced worker is more realistic, but still not attainable for entry level workers.  The private sector, subsidized  units available in North Port assist this population until their income levels 
increase through educational and/or better job opportunities are obtainable. 
 VIII .   Public and Assisted Housing  
Since 1997, North Port has seen a dramatic increase in public and assisted housing.  In 1989 the city had 38 subsidized housing units.  At the time of adoption of the 1997 Comprehensive Plan, 
that number had increased to 80 units.  Today, according to the Sarasota County Office of Housing and Community Development 2005- 2010 Consolidated Plan, the City of North Port has 
838 private sector subsidized  units .  This represents 41% of the 2,023 tax credit or subsidized 
units in the County.  The income limits to reside in these units fall into the ve ry-low to low 
range.  These  apartment complexes include:  
 
  Willow Creek     224 Units  (elderly)   
  Riley Chase     312 Units (family)  
  Grande Court    128 Units (family) 
  Victoria Point      42 Units (family) 
  Villa’s of North Port      37 Units (elderly) 
  Calusa Springs     95 Units (family)   
All of these apartments serve households in the very -low income range of 30- 50% AMI with the 
exception of Villas of North Port which serve the extremely low households below 30% AMI.  In addition to these apartme nt communities, North Port also has 86 Section 8 units, plus 29 
single family homes built by Non- Profit Organizations for low -income recipients
29. 
  
These 838 apartments are disbursed and linked to Activity Centers for employment 
opportunities, reduction in transportation costs (links to transit), and are adjacent to residential neighborhoods either existing, planned or under construction. Below is a listing of the programs offered through the Sarasota County Office of Housing and Community Development.

 At this point, according to North Port Social Services, the city does not have a major issue with homelessness. On the rare occurrence when North Port Social Services does meet with a homeless individual, they are directed to Sarasota County for assistance.   Sarasota County has 
programs, staff, and facilities specifically devoted to assisting the homeless population.   
Findings:   There are numerous programs to assist qualified renters and potential homebuyers  in 
Sarasota County . Within the City of North Port, there are 838 elderly and family units that fall 
within the affordable to workforce income levels.   These private sector units utilize tax credits to 
offer rents below  market rate.  A large  majority of tax credit/affordable housing developments are 
located in the cities within Sarasota County (see appendix for map and graphs of #units and 
locations).  Ten of these developments are located in south county, which intensifies the communing patterns to employment hubs in  north county. 
 Homelessness is not a  major issue in North Port. Sarasota County remains the primary provider 
of assistance to the homeless. 
 
IX.   Elderly and Special Needs Population  
 
Over the next 20 years, it is expected that the World War II “baby boomers” will double the number of seniors nationwide.  Although there is a clear need for affordably priced dwelling units that are conveniently located near shopping, services and community activities, research also indicates that baby boomers are quite different from their parents.  They are expected to remain mobile and independent longer than previous generations.  The design and development of new housing reflecting these lifestyle characteristics is becoming an important component of the housing industry.   
 
Page 30 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
For the less -mobile elderly and special needs populations, low maintenance requirements and 
accessibility are key issues.  Housing should be built with low maintenance materials and 
designed to allow such individuals to live independently.  In 1997, Quality Health Care Center was the only assisted living facility in the city with a 120 bed capacity.  Today, Gardens of North Port with 100 beds and North Port Pines with a 100 bed 
capacity can be added as an Adult Congregate Living Facility (ACLF).  There are several in -
home adult care facilities dispersed throughout city (Exhibit E)  which are allowed up to 6 beds  
per city code.  
Elderly Households
30 
In 2005, 3,822 households in North Port (30%) were  headed by a person age 65 or older . In 
comparison, 27% of households statewide are headed by elderly persons.  Furthermore, 3,617 of 
elderly households in North Port (95%) own their homes , which is the same percentage as in 
1997.  Only 205 elderly households rent.  
As shown in Table 9.1, 720 elderly households (19%) pay more than 30% of income for rent or 
mortgage costs.

Findings:   The vast majority of North Port households 65 and over, own their homes.  With 19% 
of all households 65 and over paying more than 30% of their income for housing, for those on 
fixed incomes, increases in housing costs such as taxes and homeowners insurance can have a significant effect o n the amount paid for housing.  Although state officials are attempting to 
rectif y insurance issues, it is still a reality facing many  citizens , therefore  the percentage of cost 
burdened elderly households need to be monitored bi- yearly. 
 North Port has more than tripled the number of beds available in adult care facilities since 1997.  
  
X.   Housing Needs  
 
Analysis from the Shimberg Center for Affordable Housing ( Table 10.1)  indicates  a construction 
need for  29,847 units  cumulatively from 2005-2030, or approximately 1,193 units per year.  In 
fiscal year 2005, according to the North Port Building Department, there were 2,826 building

permits issued, 91 of which were  multi- family .  Since 2005, the addition of Grand Court 
Apartments, and the expansion of Toledo Club apartments have added 331 units.   This figure 
illustrates that North Port is currently exceeding construction needs by over a 2:1 ratio.  Note: 
careful monitoring of each income level is needed to ensure the city meets all income level 
needs, with special emphasis on extremely low to low.

Table 10.1 provides ov erall projections of future construction needs based on the projected 
number of future households and the number of existing housing units.  These projections show the number of units tha t would need to be construct ed between a base year, in this case 200 5, 
extending thru 2030.  This would address potential growth in affordable housing need, but not 
address the existing need, i.e. those paying 30-50% of their income for housing.   
Note that T able 10.1 show s the construction need for all households at each i ncome range , not 
just those who would be expected to pay more than 50% of income for housing. In other words, 
it would be expected that existing private market construction and housing programs would address a portion of the housing need for these households, particularly those in the higher 
income ranges; not all new low -income households are destined to face a severe cost burden
.  
Typically, many households in the extremely low and low incomes ranges utilize federal and 
state funded programs to assist fin ding and subsidizing monthly housing costs.

In Table 10.2, projected construction demand is cumulatively broken down by single and multi 
family from 2005-2030 based on Table 10.1 projections.      
 
Page 32 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
Findings:  Using Shimberg projections as a guide, North Port is currently exceeding housing 
unit demand with 232 additional multi -family units, and 2,826 building permits issued in 2005.  
With the current trend, the city will exceed housing unit demand in 10 years. Monitoring of 
types, sizes, values,  and sales prices will aid in determining if each income level has adequate 
available units at no more than 35% of household income.

 Cost -burdened"" households pay more than 30% of  income for rent or mortgage costs. According 
to the Shimberg Center for Affordable Housing, in 2005, 4,139 North Port households (25%) pa y 
more than 30% of income for housing (Table 10.3)  and 9% of households pay more than 50% of 
their income for housing, which is also the same percentage for the c ounty as well.  By 
comparison, (28%) of households statewide are cost-burdened. 
In Table 10.4 below, household cost burden are shown as compared to selected cities and 
counties in the region.  North Port and Charlotte County have a lower amount of households with 
a cost burden above 30% AMI.  This further indicates affordability in North Port as compared to other regional areas.

Findings:   Although North Port shows 25% of households paying more than 30% of their 
income for housing costs, this figure is consistent with the county and slightly less than the state.   
Regionally, North Port has a lower percent of cost burdened households.  This shows that the city has a diversity of units available at all income ranges.

XI.   Residential Construction Trends  
North Port is expected to reach a population of approximately 230,000 at build-out.31  Using 2.48 
persons per household,32 that equates to 95,967 housing units of all types.  As of 2005, 21,786 
units of all types have  been constructed.  As noted earlier in this report, 15% of the housing stock 
is valued  at market prices  ($230,896 or higher).  Although this would give the impression of an 
imbalanced housing stock, recent annexations will not only bridge the gap by adding higher end 
units, but will also offer a variety of unit types.  In the near future, North Port will see 
approximately 20,000 units in multiple developments including the West Villages ( Thomas 
Ranch ) and Panacea that will bridge the gap in terms of higher end units.  In all, West Villages 
includes 8,000 acres within the boundaries of North Port on either side of U.S. 41 and River Road and will have up to 15,000 single family, paired villas, town homes, and condos for more 
than 30,000 people.  The P anacea DRI  has planned for 2,596 homes, also of varying types. 
Through another planned development, the city will see over 2,000 units with price points in the 
moderate workforce range, many of which will be located in Activity Center #5.  That basically leaves the 51,000 remaining residential platted lots yet to be developed, presumably continuing 
the current trend.  
One of the primary tenets in the 1997 Comprehensive Plan was to diversi fy the housing stock. 
With the developments listed above, it appears that t he city is meeting the goal of diversification.  
Therefore annexation based purely on housing diversification will not be necessary.

Did you know ? 
It is estimated that the construction of  100 multi -family units in Average City USA generates:  
  $5.3 million in local income; 
  $630,000 in taxes and other revenues for local governments; and 
  112 local jobs 
 Findings:  Recent annexation and existing, and planned developments on the non-plat ted lots 
will allow the city to achieve a balanced housing stock.  This indicates that the goal of housing 
diversification articulated in the 1997 Comprehensive Plan is well on the way to fruition.  If 
current market trends remain in place, the city will have a balance of all types of housing units.  Careful monitoring of the market, trends, values, and housing stock will aid in addressing

unanticipated shifts.  Due to this data, annexations based purely on housing, will not be 
necessary.  
  
XII.   Commuting C osts and P atterns   
 
 One of the signs that a region has a housing affordability issue is when workers face long 
commutes to outlying areas to jobs located in cities with high housing costs.  The results of a 
2006 c ity survey shown in Figure 12.1 illustra tes that 73% of the c ity’s work force  commute 
outside North Port to work.34 The figure does however indicate  that job opportunities have begun 
to increase in North Port, and is reflective of the city’s growing population which is in turn 
attracting new businesses, although most employment opportunities are still located outside of 
North Port.   Furthermore, of the top 20 employment locations (total employees per 1 square 
mile) in Sarasota County, none are in North Port (Exhibit F) .

  Two of the closest locations are in or near the City of Venice, the remaining locations are mainly 
in and surrounding the City of Sarasota  which is approximately 39 miles  from North Port.
35 To 
further this discussion, Figure 12.2 shows the amount of non- residential square footage permitted 
in Sarasota County as compared  to North Port . Sarasota County has permitted more non-
residential square footage than North Port by a 10:1 ratio from 1995 to 2005.  This figure clearly illustrates that most commercial and industrial activities are still concentrated in areas far north of North Port.

The longer workday resulting from extended commutes impacts quality of lif e aspects such as 
free time, family life, and ex pendable income.  Total household costs attributable to housing 
choices go far beyond the actual dollar amounts paid each month in rent or a mortgage payment.  The transportation costs incurred as a result of  location often constitute a large portion of total 
household expenses.  Utilizing a commute cost calculator and a 60 mile round trip estimation (5 day work week, $2.25 per gallon, estimated per mile vehicle depreciation, $50 per month car insurance, and a  $250 per month car payment) the estimated yearly cost of commuting is $8,208, 
or $684 per month ($434 without a car payment).   Failure to provide for a balanced mix of housing options close to jobs leads to traffic congestion and other problems that diminish quality of life.
36  Last year highway congestion cost the nation $69.5 billion in wasted fuel, and time, and 
congestion is increasing.37 
 In 2005, a  study was conducted by the Economic Development Corporation of Sarasota 
County,
38 of Sarasota County busi nesses, to determine what business owners/managers thin k 
about the current business climate.  The key findings from this survey showed that although business es are moderately well satisfied with the county business climate, the major concern 
appeared  to be affordable housing, worker availability, and the overall cost of living and taxes, as 
illustrated in Figure 12.3.  This illustration  shows the overall importance of business climate 
issues.

Findings:   The higher cost of an average home in Venice and Sarasota, as compared to North 
Port, is sub stantial for the working class. Because of existing land use patterns, 73% of workers 
are commuting outside North Port for employment .  These workers now commute to employm ent 
‘hub’s. High housing costs and the clustering of  non- residential land uses in the northern parts 
of the county are contributing to the growth of North Port.  As shown on the commute calculator, 
this land use pattern is driving commuting costs for many working families.  Economic 
diversification is necess ary in North Port, and South County. This will provide higher paying 
jobs and lessen cost contributed to commutes and enhance quality of life for citizens.  
XIII .   Mix ed-Use Strate gies 
In terms of land use, activity centers offer a unique possibility to improve housing affordability 
within the City of North Port.  By utilizing  mixed use residential development at greater 
densities, benefits such as  more efficient use of costly community infrastructure systems  become 
apparent .  Greater densities can be achieved through means (such as clustering and planned unit 
development) that preserve open space, protect sensitive natural resources, and achieve other important community objectives; smart growth, sustainable development, and transit oriented design. Consequently, through development of activity centers, along with the annexations of 
large tracts of land, North Port is able to expand the range of housing choices in terms of type 
and location in contrast to the platted lots.  The city  has positioned itself to implement these 
strategies within the village concept and activity center development s (Exhibit G) . Activity  
Centers, Village, and Town C enters afford the possibility of residential units above commercial 
developments as an added component to affordability and housing choices.

A freestanding single family house is not the only home.  In every neighborhood, residents of 
varying ages, family situations, and income levels need a variety of home types.  These include duplexes and fourplexes, units above retai l spaces, and large apartment buildings with porches, 
patios, balconies, and common gardens .
39  Amenities directly tie to quality of lif e for those in 
multi- family units.  U nique and decorative features can be included in design of outdoor spaces 
in order t o increase aesthetic beauty, environmental assets, improve physical health, mental 
health, and increase social interaction.  
 The mix and dispersion of affordable units throughout a region benefits all citizens.  In metropolitan areas to small towns, afford able housing programs and comprehensive plans in 
city’s and c ounties throughout the country encourage or require the dispersion of affordable 
units.  According to a study from the University of Texas, diversity in housing takes the ‘stigma’ and social isolation out of the equation.
40  It is not uncommon to find Nimbyism when we 
separate ourselves from our neighbors based on income.41 In areas comprised of mostly low -
income housing- particularly  those areas lacking jobs and community services, crime can be 
higher.  Whether poor or middle -class, young people who live amid concentrated poverty are far 
more likely to drop out of high school and remain jobless than their counterparts in socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods .
42  Local governments can help blunt the ef fect of  low -
income housing concentrations by encouraging their share of the state’s need for new affordable 
housing, by encouraging the development of affordable apartments and duplexes in scattered locations and approving mixed- income residential develop ments .
43  By utilizing specific design 
standards, affordable housing can integrate into neighborhoods, and dispel misconceptions of how affordable housing looks.
44   
 The concept of Smart Growth promotes mixed- income communities and connects development 
of affordable housing with jobs, services, commerce, transportation, and recreation.  When 
housing, particularly affordable housing, is dispersed throughout a region and connected to other land uses, the need for long commutes to work or shopping can be reduced.  Pockets of poverty and dis- investment are less likely to occur as a result .

Findings:   Dispersal, rather than clustering of affordable housing units creates a stronger 
community fiber and decreases the ‘stigma’ often associated with affordable hous ing.  
Affordable units , developed in a manner that encourages social interaction and built with 
amenities such as shared park spaces that  create a sense of community.  A ffordable housing can 
integrate into neighborhoods, and dispel misconceptions of how affordable housing looks  by 
using decorative features not only in the architecture of the building but the outdoor space as 
well.

Within village and activity center land uses , the city has the opportunity to expand the range of 
housing choices in terms of  type and location in contrast to the monoculture of platted lots . 
These land uses will also correspond with smart growth concepts in terms of mixed income areas by c onnect ing the  development of affordable housing with jobs, services, commerce, 
transportat ion, and recreation.  When housing, particularly affordable housing, is dispersed 
throughout a region and connected to other land uses, the need for long commutes to work or shopping can be reduced. 
 
XV.   Recommendations  
 
Rising home prices over the past few years have benefited investors, speculators, and 
homeowners throughout the region, increasing their net worth and enhancing their economic security.  At the same time, it has manipulated the market and raised the cost of entry for low -
income families, young people, and singles trying to establish a foothold in our community.   Due to affordable land and the lowest median and average sales prices as compared to Venice, 
Sarasota, unincorporated Sarasota County, and even Charlotte County, the City’s population has 
doubled in the last five years.  The following recommendations are based on the findings found throughout this report:  
   The City of North Port, as part of the Comprehensive Plan update, will continue to make 
and/or improve upon policies to endorse and support developer and non- profit initiatives to 
provide a balance of units to those who work and serve our community, aiding in the transition 
from one level of housing to the next. Based on EAR recommendations, m onitoring price points , 
types, and values of housing in all market segments to ensure demand is being met at each  
income level on a bi- yearly  basis will aid in this initiative.  Monitoring housing stock is a critical 
factor because it is difficult to forecast economic conditions such as mig ration patterns, 
demographic changes, housing interest rates, construction costs and more.  Significant variances from the trends and assumptions illustrated in this report should prompt a re -examination of the 
housing needs numbers.    The city should continue to make every effort to attract business that offer higher income 
jobs.  In addition, the city and county should work together to re -distribute economic 
development opportunities to the South, where the future concentration of the workforce populati on will reside.  
   Based on the data collected for this report  and EAR recommendations, the c ity should work 
with the Department of Community Affairs to re -write the Affordable Housing R ule in 9J5 , 
F.A.C to avoid Developments of Regional Impact outside of  the c ity from using North Port 
housing stock as a means to meet their affordable housing requirements.     Inevitably, subsidized housing will continue to be needed for the lowest -income populations .  
Due to limited resources, for those that fall into th e very -low and low income range, other 
strategies and programs are more appropriate to address the needs of these families, including: public housing, existing programs administered by the Sarasota Office of Housing and 
Community Development including HOME , SHIP, Section  8, Florida Housing Finance  
 
Page 39 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
Corporation Tax Credit Projects, HOPWA and programs administered by non- profits within the 
community.  These programs are vital to those in low income ranges and the c ity will assist in 
educating the public of the ir availability.   The city should promote and assist these programs, 
including the Housing Trust. 
   Low income  rental units should take advantage of activity and town center densities  and be 
integrated with other mixed use residential units and densities.  The se centers should have a high 
level of connectivity within the development  and surrounding neighborhoods.  Based on the 
findings of this report , the City of North Port should encourage affordable living units  (0-80% 
AMI)  above commercial development where appropriate.  These units serve a vital component of 
affordability, access to jobs, transportation, and other services.  Large multi -family apartment 
buildings should have  porches, patios, balconies, and common gardens.  These amenities directly 
tie to quality of li fe for those in the units.  It is important  that unique and decorative features be 
included in building design and outdoor spaces in order to increase aesthetic beauty, 
environmental assets, improve physical health, mental health, and incre ase social interaction.   
These actions will allow individuals to move from one level of housing to the next as their income increases while enhancing quality of life.  
   In order to maintain the current housing stock in the more established areas, the city should 
be pro- active in revitalization efforts thereby  adding to the overall quality of life in 
neighborhoods.  In order to make this option possible, the c ity should continue to have open 
discussions with Sarasota County regarding the formation of Community Redevelopment A reas 
(CRA).  At this time, the neighborhoods that would best qualify for revitalization are all located 
adjacent to U.S. 41 (Activity Center 1), which has been the subject of CRA efforts by the City of North Port since 1998.  
  Owner o ccupied single family units  of all price ranges  should be disbursed throughout the 
city. A percentage of workforce units should be included in new developments, including 
Developments of Regional Impact, in the range of 1.5%.  Developers should sign affida vits 
ensuring that these units will remain affordable for a certain amount of years, i.e. 20 years.  In 
Village Zoning, a small percentage of studio units should be included above Commercial areas, 
i.e. Village Centers.  Combining lots should be encouraged in order to have higher priced units 
within the platted portion of the city.  
   Annexations, based purely on housing diversification are not necessary. 
   Based on the findings of wage, rents and housing prices, a public discussion should take 
place reg arding changes to the Comprehensive Plan  to allow , or not allow  Accessory Dwelling 
Units (ADU’s).  These units include studios, granny flats, and units over commercial 
developments and garages.  These are typically affordable one room units for a college s tudent, 
an elderly family member, or households not able or ready for an apartment or homeownership.  Upon a finding by a local government that there is a shortage of affordable rentals within its jurisdiction, a local government, per Florida Statute 163.31771, may adopt an ordinance to allow ADU’s in any area zoned for single -family residential use.  A building permit must include an 
affidavit attesting that the unit will be rented at an affordable rate to a very -low, low, or moderate 
income person(s).  Th ere may be additional staff time involved in enforcement.  
 
Page 40 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
The basic amenities in most ADU’s include a bedroom, a bath, and a small kitchen.  There are 
pros and cons to allowing accessory dwelling units and a careful discussion needs to take place.  
Present ly, the C ity of North Port does not allow mother- in-law suites and rooms above garages.  
Allowing these types of units would help with the supply of affordable residences and to contribute to a more resource-efficient development pattern.  Due to an averag e platted lot size of 
10,000 square feet, ADU’s in North Port should be for those who combine two or more lots.  This would allow adequate space, parking, and tree canopy.  Also, we can achieve the mix of affordability that we want on a minimal inclusionary basis, rather than through the pods of the conventional subdivi sion. It is  a practical way of achieving one of the more elusive goals of New 
Urbanism.  These types of units do a number of things. First, they integrate people into neighborhoods; they are an exceptional way to save money for an apartment or transition to homeownership, especially for persons entering college or graduating students entering the 
workforce.  
The idea of integrating garage apartments and mother -in-law suites into urban planning is a key 
aspect in integrating all income types into all neighborhoods.  Listed below are some pros and 
cons of ADU’s. 
Pros46 
• Provide market-rate affordable housing without government subsidies.  
• Allow home owners to recover costs via rent, enabling them to stay in place longer than 
might otherwise be possible in housing market (e.g. allowing seniors to afford their 
homes even as overhead costs increase.)  
• Promote mixed-income neighborhoods.  
• Encourage more efficient use of transportation networks (through walking, car -pooling, 
bicycling, e.g.)  
• Increase neighborhood and household security, companionship, sociability.  
• Reduce community traffic problems, as more service employees and students are able to 
live closer to work and school.  
• Permit neighborhoods t o modestly increase residential density in support of 
transportation, local retail and environmental objectives, often without significantly 
changing the character of the neighborhood.  
• Provide supplemental income for the primary household. Such income can help pay for 
better neighborhood/household upkeep such as home renovations or yard maintenance. 
Sometimes, owners exchange reduced rent for a renter’s agreement to provide household 
maintenance (such as yard mowing). Promote neighborhood stability because  the 
additional income can help people afford to stay in their home longer, instead of being

forced to move due to unaffordable costs. Supplemental income is particularly important 
for many seniors who are on a fixed income.  
• Provide assisted living arrangements for the disabled.  
• Provide more privacy for overnight or extended-stay guests.  
• Discourage sprawl and promote infill development by promoting increased community 
population within already developed areas.  
• Provide opportunities for “extended family”  living arrangements (senior relatives, for 
example, who can live near their children instead of being placed in a nursing home).  
• Provide more efficient use of space in an age in which household sizes are shrinking. 
Smaller families often find themselves in homes that are too large for their needs, and 
such excess space can sometimes be beneficially allocated to accessory units.  
• Provide more tax revenue for the local government.  
Cons 
• May i ncrease City code enforcement costs (prohibiting them is a common way for a 
community to cheaply and indirectly control noise pollution, parking problems, unsightly 
residences).  
• Deed restricted areas m ay not be legal to allow accessory units in single -family areas, 
where the zoning only allows one family.  
• Often opposed by single -family residents as not compatible with the character of single-
family neighborhoods.  
• Difficult to enforce the definition of a “family” (if the accessory unit is to be regulated 
based on number of families).  
• May be perceived to exacerbate tran sportation and/or parking congestion.

XVI.   Definitions  
 
Affordable Housing:  Housing which monthly rents including utilities or monthly mortgage 
payments including property taxes and insurance do not exceed 30- 35% of that amount which 
repres ents the percentage of the area median annual income for the households making less than 
80 percent of the area median income calibrated to household size.  
 
Workforce Housing:  Housing, regardless of tenure, which is affordable housing to households 
earning between 80 percent and 12 0 percent of the Area Median Income, calibrated to household 
size. 
 
There is no nationally agreed upon definition of workforce housing. Many municipalities  around 
the nation have adopted varying definitions for workforce housing to address  particular 
demographic trends in their communities. Workforce housing is generally defined as housing 
that is affordable to those households whose occupants earn between  60 and 140 percent of an 
area’s median income.  
 
  
Definition:  Affordable H ousing  
State Definition 9J -5.003 
 
(1) “Affordable housing” means housing for which monthly rents or monthly mortgage 
payments, including taxes, insurance, and utilities, do not exceed 30 percent of that amount which represents the percentage of the median adjusted gross annual income for the households or persons indicated in Section 420.0004 F. S. Affordable housing definitions that are prescribed by other affordable housing programs administered by either the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or the State of Florida may be used by local governments if such programs are implemented by the local government to provide affordable housing.   
Definition: Just Value , The 2006 Florida Statutes 
193.011  Factors to consider in deriving just v aluation. --In arriving at just valuation as 
required under s. 4, Art. VII of the State Constitution, the property appraiser shall take into 
consideration the following factors:  
(1)  The present cash value of the property, which is the amount a willing purchaser would pay a 
willing seller, exclusive of reasonable fees and costs of purchase, in cash or the immediate 
equivalent thereof in a transaction at arm's length;  
(2)  The highest and best use to which the property can be expected to be put in the immediate 
future and the present use of the property, taking into consideration any applicable judicial limitation, local or state land use regulation, or historic preservation ordinance, and considering any moratorium imposed by executive order, law, ordinance, regulation, resolution, or proclamation adopted by any governmental body or agency or the Governor when the moratorium or judicial limitation prohibits or restricts the development or improvement of  
 
Page 43 of 44 ____________________________________________________ Planning & Zoning Department  
property as otherwise authorized by applicable law. The  applicable governmental body or agency 
or the Governor shall notify the property appraiser in writing of any executive order, ordinance, 
regulation, resolution, or proclamation it adopts imposing any such limitation, regulation, or 
moratorium;  
3)  The lo cation of said property;  
(4)  The quantity or size of said property;  (5)  The cost of said property and the present replacement value of any improvements thereon;  (6)  The condition of said property;  
(7)  The income from said property; and  
(8)  The net proceeds of the sale of the property, as received by the seller, after deduction of all 
of the usual and reasonable fees and costs of the sale, including the costs and expenses of financing, and allowance for unconventional or atypical terms of financing arrangements. When 
the net proceeds of the sale of any property are utilized, directly or indirectly, in the determination of just valuation of realty of the sold parcel or any other parcel under the provisions of this section, the property appraiser, for  the purposes of such determination, shall 
exclude any portion of such net proceeds attributable to payments for household furnishings or 
other items of personal property.  
Assessed Value vs. Market Value - Assessed value is the valuation placed on property  by a 
public tax assessor for purposes of taxation. It is not the same as Fair Market Value. Fair Market 
Value is the agreed upon price between a willing and informed buyer and a willing and informed seller under usual and ordinary circumstances. It is the highest price estimated in terms of money 
which the property will bring if exposed for sale on the open market with reasonable time allowed to find a purchaser who is buying with full knowledge of all the uses and purposes to 
which the property is best adapted and for which it can be legally used. 
Definition: Average vs. Median:  
An average or arithmetic mean  is figured by selecting a group with Similar Profiles (housing 
units, incomes, values…), adding up the unit, and then dividing this number by the total number 
of units in the group. 
Example: 
Average salary =   Sum of all salaries/total # of Similar Profiles  
A median  is also known as the 50th percentile. Exactly 50% of people make less than the 
median and 50% make more.

INTENT AND PURPOSE  
 
North Port, in coordination with the Sarasota County School District, has taken a long range perspective towards the provision of public schools.  A number of schools and 
facilities have been developed in the decade.  In confronting the future, North Port includes 
public schools planning in the framework of the Comprehensive Plan.  With effective 
planning, the provision of schools can be synchronized with the needs of the growing population.  Benefits from the coordination of public schools can be maximized and allocated in areas of greatest need, while maximizing the potential of co -locating these 
facilities with other public buildings and infrastructure.  
 In general, the Publi c School Facilities Element sets forth a program to serve the needs of 
residents, coordinates residential development with adequate school capacity, and encourages coordination and cooperation in planning efforts of various agencies and elected 
bodies with in Sarasota County.  
 
Public schools need appropriate funding for their construction and maintenance.  Inter-
agency coordination and cooperation is encouraged w henever and wherever possible, in 
order to provide the necessary supporting infrastructure to accomplish these tasks.  
Consistent with this general overview, specific actions are proposed to meet future needs.  
The policies outline the major precepts of the Plan, while the Capital Improvements Element is also in alignment with the School District’s Five -Year Capital Facilities Plan 
which identifies a schedule of capital outlay projects necessary to maintain educational facilities of the district.  The Plan will aid in providing high quality Public schools for the 
foreseeable future.  
 
 
PLANNING FRAMEWOR K 
 
The City Commission, in 1995, adopted by resolution the following Mission Statement  
which states - 
 
The City of North Port will provide the health, safety and  welfare services  
to our  residents which would not be provided or could not be p rovided 
efficiently or equally without  the intervention of government at the local level.  
 
The City will provide said services in a  professional and cost -effective manner,  
and only by listening to those who have put us in the position  
to serve them, our residents.

FLO RIDA STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS 
 
The Public School Facilities Element is intended to meet the requirements of Chapter 163, 
Florida Statutes, and Rule 9J- 5.025 (Public School Facilities Element for Public School 
Concurrency, Florida Administrative Code.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Schools can act as an anchor in the community. They are a symbol of a neighborhood's stability and s erve families in the community. They transmit knowledge to new 
generations, advance knowledge, display the achievements of society, plus bring neigh bors 
together for PTA meetings, s chool plays, and soccer games. They offer their classrooms and 
media centers to residents for adult education classes, commun ity and club meetings. They 
are key determinants of the quality of life and are valued symbols of community identity 
and achievement.  The entire community benefits from schools.  Moreover, the community is 
often evaluated on the basis of the quality of i ts schools. The planning process that guides 
decision- making on school size, location, and programs should, therefore, be coordinated 
with the process that guides all community development.  
 Planning for school facilities is one of the responsibilities of the local Sarasota County School Board (School Board) . In the past, it was often a separate process from local 
government planning.  The proper functioning and the best distribution of schools are possible only when school planning is coordinated with the larger process of community planning for growth and change. Based on recent legislation, school conc urrency 
requirements are now required by Florida Statutes, Sections 163.3177(6)(h), 163.3177 (12), 163.31777, and 163.3180(13).  The City of North Port (the City) established a school 
concurrency structure through partnership with the School Board, Sarasota County (the 
County), and the other municipalities in the county, which are  the City of Sarasota, City of 
Venice and Town of Longboat Key.  
 North Port, in cooperation and coordination with the School Board, the County and other 
municipalities in the count y, is incorporating  public schools into the framework of the 
Comprehensive Plan . 
 The following sections present: the guidelines for the development of schools; the standards with which the School Board evaluates school facilities; an inventory of existing  facilities 
and planned future facilities; an evaluation of the school system based on these standards and determination of need; an analysis of funding; an analysis of coordination between school planning and local land use planning; and Objectives and Po licies for such 
coordination. Public School Facility Element 
  9-5 GUIDELINES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOLS  
The Educational Facilities Plant Survey, a school district’s official list of approved projects, 
is required by the State at least every five years.  Sarasota County School’s latest su rvey 
was completed in 2005.   
 According to the State Requirements for Educational Facilities (SREF), a school site should 
be adequate to address existing needs based on school programs and enrollment and to 
allow economical future expansion and development.  The choice of sites for new schools is of critical importance in the overall development of a school facilities program.  New sites should be located to minimize transportation and infrastructure costs and should be sized so that they provide adequate space for school buildings, storm water  retention, off street 
parking, queuing for parent and bus loading and unloading, and playground areas.  
 SREF presents minimum space requirements based on program needs, pursuant to Rule A -
2.032, Florida Administrati ve Code, Size of Space, and Occupant Design Capacity Criteria.  
The minimum space requirements include student capacity, student stations, gross square 
footage of buildings, and facilities’ utilization.  Student capacity is the maximum number of 
students a  school facility is designed to accommodate.  A student station is the area 
necessary for a student to engage in learning activities, and varies with particular types of activities.  It is a measure of the use of space in schools.  
 
According to SREF, stude nt capacity in elementary schools can be equated to the number of 
student stations, since elementary school students are assigned to one classroom 
throughout the day.  In secondary schools (middle and high), however, students move from classroom to classro om depending on their subjects.  Scheduling then becomes a factor in 
calculating capacity as well as the number of students and student stations.  Therefore, 
utilization factors have been established in determining capacity.  
 
According to SREF, the optimum size of elementary schools is 600 -800 students.  It is 
educationally and economically desirable for an elementary school to be large enough to justify a full time principal, a librarian, and instructional and clerical services.  The 
optimum size for middle schools is 1,000- 1,200 students, and for high schools, it’s 1,800-
2,000 students.  
 
The School Board has indicated that the operation and administration of larger schools is 
more economically feasible than smaller schools, so long as the educational stand ards are 
maintained.  Therefore, in order to guide its facilities planning efforts, the School Board has adopted the following minimum space requirements, which are higher than those suggested by the State:  
 
 
Elementary Schools (Grades K - 5) 
Student Capac ity  1,040 (State: 600 - 800) 
Student  Stations  1,040 (State: 600 - 800) 
Program Capacity   863 
 Public School Facility Element 
  9-6 Middle Schools (Grades 6 -8) 
Student Capacity   1,080 (State: 900 - 1,080)  
Student Stations   1,200 (State: 1,000 - 1,200)  
Program Capacity   1,026  
 
High Schools (G rades 9 -12) 
Student Capacity   2,818 (State: 1,620 -1,800)  
Student Stations   2,966 (State: 1,800 -2,000)  
Program Capacity  2,536  
 
Sarasota County School District reports capacity to the Department of Education using the 
standards of the Florida Inv entory of School Houses (FISH).  FISH capacity is reported in 
two ways, including:  satisfactory student stations for permanent facilities and relocatables 
(portables); and, FISH capacity for permanent and relocatables adjusted by utilization. Sarasota County uses FIS H capacity for reporting purposes to the Department of 
Education.  
 However, for the purposes of implementing school concurrency the Sarasota County School 
Board has directed District staff to use program capacity as an alternative method for 
measuring the capacity of schools.  This capacity measure is a more exact means of reflecting the actual use of a school’s space taking into account special needs students and special programs to determine the capacity of its schools.  In some instances, specialized programs may be recognized as full -time classroom uses and, therefore, may add capacity to 
FISH.  In other instances, program capacity may reduce FISH capacity.  If these factors are not considered when discussing capacity, the result may be a mistaken impres sion that 
classrooms are being under - or over -utilized. 
INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS  
In Sarasota County, elementary schools include pre -kindergarten through fifth grade (PK -
5), middle schools include grades 6 -8, combination elementary and middle schools include 
grades K -8, and high schools, grades 9- 12.  As of 2007, Sarasota County had twenty -one 
elementary schools, six middle schools, one combined elementary and middle school, five 
high schools, eight special purpose schools and nine charter schools.  Figure 9-1 presents 
the location of existing and planned School Board facilities.  Currently, there are two 
schools planned in North Port in the next five years. The special education schools provide various other educational programs.  For instance, Oak Park specializes in the education of emotionally, physically and developmentally challenged students, while Pine View 
specializes in the education of gifted students.  Other ancillary school related facilities such 
as school administration, technical training, and co nstruction services are also depicted in 
Figure 9-1. 
 
The 2007- 08 student enrollments in Sarasota County's elementary, middle, high, and 
special purpose schools was 40,121 students.  Student enrollment is projected to reach 
40,913 students in the 2011- 12 school year, an increase of 2%.  Table 9-1 illustrates the 
current and projected enrollment. The “Special Purpose Schools” category includes special 
education and alternative schools . In 2007, the school district reported a FISH capacity of 
the Sarasota County school system of 54,362.  Public School Facility Element

 Concurrency Service Areas that coincide with the attendanc e zones of high, middle and 
elementary schools are also proposed.  Because student assignment for special schools and charter schools is not limited by conventional attendance zone boundaries, their available 
capacity will be allocated district -wide or by other methods as appropriate to each special 
purpose school.  To ensure that adequate school capacity is available , level of service (LOS) 
standards based on program capacity are proposed for adoption as follows:

Of the new schools that were approved in the current 2005 Educational Facilities Plant 
Survey, North Port’s fourth elementary school, Lamarque Elementary, opened in 2006; North Port’s second middle school is under constructio n and will open in 2008; a north 
county technical high school will open in 2008; North Port’s technical high school will open in 2009; and, North Port’s fifth elementary school will open in 2009.  
 The 2005 Survey approved major renovations and replacements.  North Port had one major renovation on the list for Toledo Blade Elementary.  
 The ten year program includes major renovations and additions to several schools.  The ten year program also includes one new middle school and four new elementary schools, one of which will be located in North Port.  
 
The School Board has a Tentative Facilities Work Program FY 07- 08 through FY 11- 12 as 
shown in the technical document that includes capital projects to address new growth and renovations and improvements, as liste d in 
Table 9-2.

FUNDING 
 
The five -year period extending from 2007- 08 through 2011- 12 anticipates the expenditure 
of $634 million of which $390 million (62%) is allocated to increase permanent program 
capacity in the public school system.  This expenditure is programmed to add 3,649 in program capacity.  An additional 9,368 in program capacity is programmed for construction 
by 2017.  The majority of this capacity will be in permanent facilities.  The Five -Year 
Capita l Facilities Plan  as shown in the technical document also allocates $212 million to 
the renovation of existing schools and general capital upgrades, including maintenance of 
the educational facilities.  
 The District has also projected its needs for the ten  and twenty -year time period.  Over the 
ten-year period, the District anticipates an additional $804 million in expenditures for 
capacity enhancements.  Over the twenty -year period from 2007 -08 through 2026- 27, the 
District projects a total expenditure of approximately $1.4 billion for capacity enhancements.  This expenditure is programmed to add 19,978 in program capacity.  Ultimately, the ability of the Sarasota County School District to meet the capacity demands 
of the growing population depends upon the  availability of funding for capital 
improvements and the effective allocation of these funds.  
 
Sarasota County Public Schools receive capital outlay revenues from a variety of sources as 
identified in Table 9-3 and Table 9-3A.  The Capital Investment Tax (CIT) set at 2 mil is 
the most significant of the capital revenue sources.  The District may allocate these funds only on capital projects contained in the DOE -approved School Plant Survey  as shown in 
the technical document and the revenues tend to increas e with both population growth and 
increasing property values.  As noted, the CIT revenue is projected to rise from about $119 million dollars annually to about $144 million by 2011 -12.  Almost $658 million is projected 
to be raised over the coming five yea rs with about 67% of these funds ($444 million) 
available for capacity enhancement.  
 
The Infrastructure Sales Tax  represents the second most significant revenue for school 
capacity needs. In June 1989, Sarasota County voters approved a referendum enacting a 
one-cent sales discretionary tax called the ""Infrastructure Surtax"", to be levied by Sarasota 
County for the purpose of construction, reconstruction or improvement of public facilities, 
pursuant to Chapter 212.055, Florida Statutes.  The Infrastructure S urtax became effective 
in September, 1989, and was to sunset in 1999.  It was subsequently approved by the voters to continue for an additional ten years until 2009.  Sarasota County Ordinance 2007- 08 re -
authorizes the Infrastructure Surtax for 15 more years and provides a general description of the County infrastructure projects to be funded with the surtax proceeds.  
 Public School Facility Element 
  9-10 Twenty- five percent (25%) of the proceeds of this one- cent addition to the sales tax are 
distributed to the School district to be used for i ncreases in the capacity of existing schools 
and the construc tion of new schools.  In the period 1989- 1996, the School Board received 
$48.8 million dollars from Infrastructure Surtax funds, which was used for various 
improvements to existing facilities, t he construction of new facilities, and the purchase of 
sites for future facilities.  This source generates about $16.9 million currently and is expected to produce about $19 million annually by 2011- 12. The $90 million produced by 
this revenue over the nex t five years is available for capacity enhancement.  
 In 2004, the School Board adopted a resolution that requested the County government and all the cities within the county to adopt an Educational Facility Impact Fee.  North Port collects the impact fees on new residential development for the School Board per Sarasota County Code Chapter 70, Article VII, as authorized by the Interlocal Agreement between 
the School Board and the City of North Port.  Impact fees currently generate about $6.4 
million annually  county -wide.  This revenue is expected to produce about $32 million 
county -wide over the five year period.  It should be noted that impact fee revenues must be 
spent on new capacity and are dependent on the pace of growth.   
 
 
Public Education Capital Out lay (PECO) funds provided by the Department of Education 
are based on demonstrated capacity need.  Over the five -year period, about $12 million is 
expected from this source for expanded capacity county -wide.  Other revenue sources 
include:  the Capital Outlay and Debt Service (CO&DS) Trust Fund and a one -time 
appropriation for Classroom for Kids and funds under the Effort Index Grant.  Over the next five years the district projects net revenues available for capacity to be approximately $444 million.  
 
Table  9-3 and Table 9-3A provide projections of revenues for an additional five -year period 
for the long term concurrency management program.  These projections assume that the conditions and assumptions underlying the 2007- 08 to 2011- 12 projections will continue 
and indicate that ample resources should be available to meet the capital needs for s chools 
projected by this study.  Public School Facility Element

COORDINATED PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES PLANNING  
School planning is about providing adequate facilities, support network and services to educate 
Florida's residents.  In 2002, the Governor of the State identified school planning as a critical 
issue facing Florida's communities and ordered new legislation that required a com prehensive 
focus on school planning by requiring coordination of information.  
 
The new regulations required local governments and school boards to enter into interlocal 
agreements that address school siting s, enrollment forecasting, school capacity, infra structure, 
collocation and joint use of civic and school facilities, sharing of development and school construction information, and dispute resolution and oversight.  
 
In 2003, Sarasota County, the Town of Longboat Key, the City of North Port, the City of 
Sarasota, the City of Venice, and the School Board adopted the Interlocal Agreement, for Public 
School Facility Planning.  The process to adopt and implement the Interlocal A greement has 
improved the working relationships between the County, School Distric t and Municipalities and 
has led to a better understanding of each other’s issues and concerns.  
 
The result has been better understanding and cooperative decision making for school projects, 
collaborative initiatives to purchase lands and utilize existing County - and School Board -owned 
lands, better coordination of neighborhood compatibility and infrastructure with school projects, 
and improved data sharing.  Coordinated planning efforts are leading to improved timing of sidewalk projects, improved traffic flow surrounding schools, improved buffers with school 
neighbors, and improved sensitivity for historical structures.  
 
Along with th e coordination prompted by the Interlocal A greement, Section 163.3174, Florida 
Statutes, requires the Local Planning Agency,  which in the City is the Planning and Zoning 
Advisory Board (PZAB), include a representative of the school district as a nonvoting member.  
North Port includes the representative as part of the City’s Development Review Committee 
(DRC) as well.  This memb ership, along with the school board’s review of development approval 
plans, keeps the School Board up -to-date on land use decisions that could affect future student 
populations.  
 
Section 163.3177(6)(a), Florida Statutes, requires that the Future Land Use element of the 
Comprehensive Plan clearly identify the land use categories in which public schools are an 
allowable use.  When delineating the land use categories where public schools are an allowable use, a local government is required to include in the categories sufficient land proximate to residential development to meet the projected needs for schools in coordination with public school boards and may establish differing criteria for schools of different type or size.  Each local 
government shall include lands contiguous to existing school sites, to the maximum extent 
possible, within the land use categories in which public schools are an allowable use.  School population projections and school site selection criteria are both add ressed through the Inter local 
Agreement which requires coordination between the County, School Board and municipalities 
and the Comprehensive Plan.  
 
It is generally accepted that elementary schools should be located within residential 
neighborhoods. Middle and high schools, howev er, have a greater impact on the neighborhoods 
due to their increased size, traffic, sports events, and student movement.  These schools are  Public School Facility Element 
 9-14  
better suited to be located at the periphery of neighborhoods to serve a larger area and on larger 
roadways, such as collector and arterial roads.   
 
Schools operated by the School Board of Sarasota County are allowed pursuant to City of North 
Port’s Future Land Use Policy 1.11 as shown in the technical document,  in the classifications of 
“Low, Medium and High Density Residential”, “Activity Center”, and “Public”.  Schools are also allowed pursuant to Policy 13.2. as shown in the technical document in the “Town Center” 
portion of areas with the “Village” land use classification.  School sites must be rezoned to a 
zoning category that is compatible with the land use designation before they can be built; and, 
must be reviewed by the City staff’s Development Review Committee.   
 
In 2004, the School Board adopted a resolution that requested the County government and all the 
cities within the county to adopt an Educational Facility Impact Fee.  The impact fee, collected by 
the County and the municipalities and distributed to the School Board, is payable at the time of the Certificate of Occupancy.  The current rate paid by N orth Port in 2008 is $2,032 for single -
family, $474 for multi -family and $138 for mobile home dwelling units.  
 
The impact fee ordinance includes exemptions for principle residential uses that qualify as 
affordable housing or housing for deed restricted communities for persons 55 or older. The School Board and the County Office of Housing and Communi ty Development entered into an Interlocal 
Agreement to process the affordable housing exemptions.  The School Board uses non -impact fee 
revenues to pay the impa ct fee that is waived from the affordable housing exemption.  
 
The improved coordination and the additional revenues from the impact fee help to address the 
needs for adequate school facilities for the County’s and Cities’ existing and future population, but do not fully meet the financial needs of the School Board.  Additionally, the class size amendment and the Pre -Kindergarten initiative, which were approved by Florida voters in 2002, 
were not adequately funded by the State.  The class size amendment is s till being debated by the 
governor’s office.  This amendment would change how facility needs are calculated.  Rather than evaluating capacity at the district level, it will be evaluated at the school level, and in three years, at the classroom level.  Unless the amendment is repealed or modified, the School Board’s facility needs would grow tremendously as the class size requirements would drill down from the district level to the school level and eventually to the class level.  Furthermore, the volunteer 
universal Pre -K initiative may further strain the facility needs of the school district.  
 
The 2005 Florida Legislature adopted requirements (referred to as school concurrency) that 
strengthen the relationship between land use planning and development, and p lanning for public 
schools to ensure availability of school capacity.  In 2006, Sarasota County was selected by the 
Florida Department of Community Affairs as a “pilot community”.  Sarasota County, the School 
Board, the municipalities of Sarasota, Venice, Longboat Key, and North Port worked to prepare a  
draft Interlocal A greement, a public school facilities’ element, and amendments to 
intergovernmental coordination and capital improvement elements.  
 
These draft documents were used to assist the pilot communities as well as serve as examples for 
other areas of Florida.  As a part of the process, elected officials from each of the governing bodies have participated in three convocations in order to provide direction and reach consensus on the draft documents.   The County, the School Board, the Cities and Town have adopted a joint 
Amended Interlocal Agreement for School Facility Planning  as shown in the technical document ,  Public School Facility Element 
 9-15  
as well as coordinated the process for adoption of the Public School Facilities Element , and 
amendments to the Intergovernmental Coordination and Capital Improvements Elements to 
ensure all local government Comprehensive Plan elements within the County are consistent with 
each other.  
 
In addition, the Data and Analysis Section as shown in the technical document  supports the 
amendments for Sarasota County and all the cities within required to implement school 
concurrency.  The study evaluates the school system and its relationship to development and 
growth from both a county -wide perspective and a finer grain look at schools within sectors  and 
communities.  The findings and conclusions support the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan including the establishment of levels of service standards and the delineation of concurrenc y service areas.  
 
CONCERNS FOR SCHOOLS  
The preceding sections suggest the following concerns:  
  
Sarasota County Schools’ existing facilities struggle to meet the demands of rapid 
growth and lower class sizes, while at the same time keeping pace with the rep lacement 
of aging facilities and the needs for technology upgrades.  
 The existing school impact fees, combined with other local and state revenues, do not 
meet the school district’s facility needs.  
 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCHOOLS  
The preceding discussions sugges t the following opportunities:  
 
 The School Board has planned future school facilities from 200 7 through 2012 which will 
increase the 2012 school facilities system capacity (as measured in numbers of student 
stations).  
 Sarasota County, the municipalities, and the School Board have established and 
improved formal coordination and could expand long range and immediate efforts in 
collaboration, shared uses, and information sharing.  
 Sarasota County, the municipalities, and the School Board have implemented a public 
school facilities impact fee to be utilized for growth.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT ELEMENT 
Introduction 
The purpose of the Capital Improvements Chapter, or Element (CIE), is to tie the implementing goals, objectives, 
and policies of the Comprehensive Plan as a whole with the  funded improvements to support them.  The Chapter 
also fulfills the mandates of Chapter 163, Florida Statutes, which provides a strategy to meet the infrastructure requirements of the Comprehensive Plan and to identify the means by which to fund these requirements.  The 
resulting element identifi es the expenditures required to construct future infrastructure needs and viable revenue 
sources to fund those needs.    The Florida Legislature, with the adoption of the Community Planning Act, 2011 and subsequent  amendments, 
initiated significant changes in the requirements for the Capital Improvements Element (CIE) and Concurrency Management.  Section 163.3177, F.S. now reads, in part: 
 The comprehensive plan shall contain a capital improvements element designed t o consider  
the need for and the location of public facilities in order to encourage the efficient use of such facilities and set forth:  
•   A component that outlines principles for construction, extension, or increase in 
capacity of public facilities, as w ell as a component that outlines principles for 
correcting existing public facility deficiencies, which are necessary to implement the  
comprehensive plan. The components shall cover at least a 5- year period.  
•   Estimated public facility costs, including a  delineation of when facilities will be  
needed, the general location of the facilities, and projected revenue sources to fund the facilities.  
•   Standards to ensure the availability of public facilities and the adequacy of those 
facilities to meet established acceptable levels of service.  
•   A schedule of capital improvements which includes any publicly funded projects of 
federal, state, or local government, and which may include privately funded projects for which the local government has no fisca l responsibility. Projects necessary to  
ensure that any adopted level -of-service standards are achieved and maintained for  
the 5 -year period must be identified as either funded or unfunded and given a level 
of priority for funding. 
•   The schedule must include transportation improvements included in the applicable 
metropolitan planning organization’s transportation improvement program adopted pursuant to s. 339.175(8) to the extent that such improvements are relied upon to ensure concurrency. The schedule must be coordinated with the applicable metropolitan planning organization’s long-range transportation plan adopted pursuant to s. 339.175(7). 
 Other legislative changes affecting the preparation of the CIE and Concurrency Management  
include: 
•   Provisions for preparing the CIE (i.e. Covering a 5-year period; identifying whether 
the project is funded or unfunded and given a level of priority for funding; and deleting the requirements for financial feasibility;   
•   The annual CIE review is no longer required to be submitted to the state land 
planning agency (it is adopted by ordinance by the county and therefore, is no longer considered an annual amendment to the Comprehensive Plan); 
•   Concurrency is only mandated by the State for Potable Water, San itary Sewer, Solid                                                                                                                                    Capital Improvement Element 
 10-4 Waste and Drainage; and  
•   Concurrency is optional for roads, Parks and Public Schools, but the county has the 
option to extend concurrency to these services and facilities. Concurrency requires 
that capacity be available to support the impact of development within the adopted level of service.  
 One of the most significant aspects embodied in the Capital Improvements Element (CIE)  is the establish ment  of 
Levels of Service (LOS) for those facility types required in the CIE.  The City  must maintain the adopted LOS 
standards for both current and future residents.  These LOS standards must be balanced between community goals that exemplify ""quality of life"" considerations on one hand, and economic priorities and affordability on the other.  If the adopted LOS standards are not maintained during implementation of the Plan, then the City  must deny 
additional development permits  or may require additional steps to limit additional development. If financial 
constraints compel the deferment of infrastructure projects that would maintain the adopted LOS, then phases of development may be approved and constructed as funding becomes available. The process for achieving and 
maintaining level of service for public facilities is concurrency management. Con currency management requires 
that capacity be available to support the impact of development  within the adopted level of service; 
implementation is through the CIE and the City’s Unified Land Development Code.  Sections 163.3177 and 163.3180 F.S. establish the basic relationship between Level of Service (LOS) and 
concurrency which provides the City the key product of the Capital Improvements Element – the Five -Year 
Schedule of Capital Improvements. The CIE includes the 5- Year Schedule of Capital Improvement s which is a 
balanced, multi -year spending plan setting the priority and timing for the construction of projects to maintain 
concurrency . It takes projects from the City’s FY2018 - FY2022 Capital Improvements Program and includes the 
Five-Year Schedule of Capital Improvements to provide a method to assess the impact of residential growth, and 
establishes the Level of Service based on a financially feasible Capital Program.  This schedule is revised annually 
and adopted by the City Commission (by ordinance). Further, the Capital Improvements project list is updated annually by incorporating the previous year as part of the prior funding and the inclusion of new fifth year. New projects are added to the five -year schedule of capital improv ements during each annual update, and adjustments 
may be made in the funding and timing of projects that are already in the schedule, thus permitting continual adjustment to changing conditions and circumstances.  The City of North Port is unique in that 75 square miles was platted in the 1960/70’s  by General Development 
Corporation (GDC) and 25 square miles is not platted.  This means that the City has the planning challenges of a platted lot community  and the more typical planning challenges of non -platte d agricultural land that is planned to 
transition into urban land uses.  To address these challenges the City has , and always will, plan for ultimate bui ld-
out. For this Comprehensive Plan the official planning time frame is a 1 3-year period from 2017 through 2030, 
with the first five years being the Capital Improvements  Program (CIP) planning period.  T hose level -of-service 
related projects show appropriated funding for the five -year period.  This information is provided in Table 1 of 
the Goals, Objectives, and Policies of this element . Table 2 lists the projects anticipated in the “out years” of the 
planning time frame , with anticipated funding. Table 3 is provided to indicate other projects that may well come 
online by 2030, beyond the planning timeframe, to meet anticipated growth .  The facilities on these tables include 
roads (multimodal), water, sewer, schools, and parks.  The planning time frame is based on the adopted levels of service as articulated in the CIE Element, Goals, Objectives and Policies.     
 To compliment the City’s planning approach, the master planning process is used to detail the specific facilities, 
to develop phasing schedule s, and to identify funding sources.  To date, the City has a Fire/EMS master plan ( Fire 
Rescue Station Location, Apparatus, and Staffing Study for the City of North Port, Florida, Public Safety 
Solutions, Inc. 2004) , utilities master plan s (see Potable Water Element Policy 2.6) , a parks and  recreation master 
plan is nearing completion and a government facil ity needs study is being developed.  The City updates these 
master plans at least every five years.  A new master plan is recommended for transportation.                                                                                                                                    Capital Improvement Element

Working Towards Build -out 
 The exact date of build -out is not projected because build- out is dependent on the fluctuations of the national 
economy.  Staff analyzed the projected build- out population based on the allowable densities from the Future 
Land Use M ap, as proposed.  Staff also analyzed the projected non -residential land uses based on the Future Land 
Use M ap, as proposed.  The projections yielded a population of ± 270,911, ±33,752,660 square feet of 
commercial/employment with ±70,369 employees.  The following presents the estimated needs.  
 
Police :  The Police D epartment is projected to have at least 475 sworn officers.  This projection wa s based on the 
level of service standard of 1.9 officers per 1,000 population that was included in the 1997 version of this 
Comprehensive Plan, but which has been removed from this version, per City Commission direction, since this is not a required standard. Presently, the Police Department has approximately 100 sworn officers.     
 The Police Department is funded by the general fund and police impact fees are used to fund capital improvement 
such as police vehicles.  The North Port Fiscal Analysis Model (NPFAM) showed that, at build- out and assuming 
the current revenue environment, the Police Department is projected to be fiscally sustainable.   
 
Fire Department :  The Fire Department Master Plan, as shown below, indicates 11 Fire stations at build -out.  
Presently, there are three fully equipment permanent stations and two temporary station.  Two fire stations (one 
in Thomas Ranch and the other is located on Greenwood/North Port Blvd) are under design at this w riting .

 10-6  
The yearly operation budget comes from the Fire District fees and the Fire District collects impact fees for the construction of capital facilities/equipment.    
Parks and  Recreation :  Based on the level of service in the Recreation  and Open Space Element, the City will 
need ±500 acres of parks, ±500 acres of open space and ±1,750 acres of conservation land.   
 Today the City has  26 parks at  ±485 acres of par ks and the envi ronmental park. The City also owns ±154 acres 
planned for parks.  This totals ± 639 acres.  Prior to build- out the City will exceed the amount of acreage to meet 
the projected build- out estimate of ±500 acres . 
 For conservation land, the City has ± 10,081 acres.  The majority of this acreage is in the State Forest.  This number 
does not include environmental areas within private developments.  Therefore, the City has planned for ample acreage to meet the build -out estimate of ±1,750.   
 For open space, the City has ± 2,903 acres.  This area is predominantly in the Myakkahatchee Creek corridor.  
This acreage number does not include open space required in private developments.  Therefore, the City has planned for ample acreage to meet the build- out estimate of ±500 especially if the Orange Hammock area becomes 
a conservation easement .   
 
Schools:   Working with the School Board, staff anticipates a build- out need of 10 elementary schools, 3 middle 
schools and 3 high schools.  The City presently has 5 elementary s chools, 2 middle schools, 1  technical  school 
(under construction), and 1 high school.  
 The areas shown as Village on the Future Land Use map are under construction or approved.  The demographics for these areas will need to be monitored to ensure adequate  school sites are planned.  The School district and 
West Villages have recently secured 60 acres for future school campus K -8 on the property. 
 
Water/sewer :  Staff estimates that at build -out the City will need ±24.6 million gallons per day  for potable water .  
Currently the Utilities M aster Plan (see Potable Water Element, Policy 2.6)  for 2027 shows ±18 million gallons 
per day peak period for water.  The existing capacity and facilities are show n in the Potable Water Element.  
 The build-out estimate for sanitary sewer is 23.5 million gallons per day average flow and 61 million gallons per day peak flow.  The existing ca pacity and facilities are show n in the Sanitary Sewer Element.  
 
Transportation:  At build -out, staff anticipates the followin g needs. 
1. I-75 and US- 41 will have at least six lanes,  
2. Price Blvd . from Biscayne Blvd to Orlando Blvd. will have at least four lanes,  
3. Orlando Blvd. from Price  Blvd. to the southern City limits will have at least four lanes,  
4. Yorkshire Blvd. from I -75 to t he southern City limits will have at least four lanes,  
5. Toledo Blade Blvd from Hillsborough Blvd. to Tropicaire Blvd. will have at least four lanes,  
6. River Road through the City will have at least four lanes,  
7. West Villages Parkway from the southern City limits to River Road (north of US -41) will have two to 
four lanes.   
8. An interchange will need to be built at I -75 and Yorkshire Blvd to accommodate AC 6. 
 The City is presently analyzing the Price Blvd. corridor in an effort to identify transportation options because the City has only one City  arterial  roadway facility to provide east/west movements.  To develop an acceptable 
transportation system, all modes of transportation will need to be analyzed including, mass transit, pedestrian facilities, and bridges to connect neighborhoods and to connect neighborhoods to activity centers.

 Fiscal Capacity - REVENUES  
The City of North Port has a variety of revenue sources to fund its operations and capital improvements. Major revenue sources include:  
 Ad Valorem Taxes:  Ad valorem tax is the single largest source of revenue to fund general governmental 
operations.  Utility Franchise Fees & Taxes:   The City has a franchise agreement with Florida Power and Light which allows 
the non- exclusive right and pr ivilege of supplying electricity and other services within the City free of 
competition.    Municipal Revenue Sharing (State Shared Revenue):   The City receives an allocation of revenues pursuant to 
s. 218.245(2), FS collected by the State, which include portions of municipal fuel taxes and state sales taxes.  The formula to distribute the tax to the City is based on adjusted population, sales tax collections and relative ability of the City to raise revenue.  Simply stated, it means that the City’s assesse d valuation is a factor.   
 Half -Cent Sales Tax:   The City receives a share of the local government half -cent sales tax based on a formula 
which returns a half cent of the sales tax collected within Sarasota County.  The municipal distribution formula is based on the City’s population divided by a combination of the total County population plus 2/3 of the 
incorporated population.    One-Cent Sales Tax:   The City receives a share of the local discretionary infrastructure sales surtax authorized 
in s.  212.054- .055, FS for a period of ten years based on a voter approved referendum which was set to expire 
on August 31, 1999.  On November 4, 1997, the voters approved a ten -year extension of this tax through the year 
2009.  On November 6, 2007, the voters approved another extension of 15 years.    Gas Tax:   The City receives six cents from the Local Option Fuel Tax imposed on motor and diesel fuels; five 
cents from the Local Option Fuel Tax imposed on motor fuel only; and one cent from the County 9
th Cent Fuel 
Tax.  These taxes are distributed to the City based on a population formula and are restricted in use to 
transportation related expenditures including projects such as roadway/rights -of-way improvements, sidewalks, 
street lighting, traffic signs, street rehabilitation and residential traffic improvement projects.    Impact Fees:  The City collects impact fees for law enforcement, fire protection, parks, roads, solid waste, and 
general government services.  The fees are imposed based upon the amount of  new demand attributable to new 
development and the cost of providing the additional capital improvements needed to serve the new development.  Assessment Districts:   The City has funded capital improvements through the use of non- ad valorem assessment 
districts.  The Road and Drainage District has funded projects such as sidewalks, capital equipment purchases and road rehabilitation.  The Fire Rescue District has used non ad valorem assessments to construct fire stations and purchase fire apparatus.  The Solid Wast e District often uses non ad valorem assessments to purchase capital 
equipment.  Utility User Fees, Impact Fees and Connection Fees:   User fees are charged to those who are receiving water 
and sewer services.  Fees are established to pay for the operating costs, capital improvements, debt service on outstanding debt and to provide adequate revenue coverage for revenue bonds.  Water and Sewer impact fees are used to fund the capital costs of constructing the growth expansion needs of the water and wastewater systems.  
                                                                                                                                   Capital Improvement Element 
 10-8 Revenue Bonds:  Bonds financed by the user fees of those directly benefiting from the improvements.  The City 
has several bond issues outstanding which have financed the construction of various capital improvements to the 
Water and Wastewater ut ility system.  
 10-Year Planning Period Based on the population projections found in the Needs Analysis, Table 2 of the Future Land Use Element  
identifies the facilities that are projected to be needed from 2017-2030.  These projects correspond to the geographic areas shown on Map 10-1.

11-3  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  ELEMENT 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Since the end of the 2007 -2009 recession, there has been a desire for  greater commitment to North 
Port’s economic development from its existing business owners and operators. 
The Economic  Development  Element  is an optional  element  in North Port’s  Comprehensive  Plan.  
The intent of this  element  is to both  address specific issues that already exist within the City . and  to 
provide a guiding philosophy for future development goals, providing  insight into the thoughts of the 
City’s institutions and guiding  those who seek to participate in North Port’s  business community . 
The ultimate goal of the Comprehensive Plan is to seek a brighter future for the City of North Port 
and the its place in the local, regional, and national economy  while contributing to the  cultivation of 
a prosperous future. Although  not a required  element, the subject  is important  enough to warrant  
careful  consideration  in assessing  the City’s  future . With the continued growth of the City,  the need 
for a clearly articulated vision of the City’s economic development goals and policies  becomes more 
apparent . 
This element  recognizes  that economic  relationships  exist between  geographic  areas.  
Coordination with various  levels  of government  and with private  enterprise can help create a 
more efficient and power system . 
This element  is a starting  point  and tool to promote  economic  development , its value lies in 
documentation of statistics  and conditions, and in providing  ideas,  opportunit ies, and policy. This 
element  needs  to be used with additional  strategic  actions  for future  economic development , and 
each part should be seen as both a product of the moment and a hope for the immediate future . 
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE NORTH PORT ECONOMY 
The following provides a general  description  of the North Port  economy  and its relationships 
with the regional economy of the North Port -Sarasota- Bradenton area and the Florida Suncoast 
region . The data includes  an analysis  of industry diversity, major  employers,  educational 
attainment, cost  of income, and cost of  living.  
Workforce  
In 2009-2014, for the employed  population 16 years  of age and  older, the leading  industries 
located  in North Port  were educational  services,  health  care,  and social  assistance,  which  
accounted  for 20.4 percent  of the workforce, while  retail  trade accounted  for 17.3 percent  of all  
residents that were employed at jobs located in  the City . 
Jobs and Major  E mployment  
Due to North Port’s development as a platted lands community, the ability of North Port to attract    
Economic Development Element  
11-4  large employers has been limited due , in part, to having few areas set aside for non- residential uses.  
Specifically, the initial General Development Corporation development plan for Port Charlotte and 
what is now North Port  was for North Port (Charlotte)  to serve as a residential communi ty, with 
95% percent of the initial land area within the City set aside for residential uses and for large scale 
commercial, office and industrial uses  to be located near the intersection of SR 776 and US 41 in 
Charlotte County.  In many cases, the lands t hat are available for industrial uses were much smaller 
in scale than what would meet the needs for a larger employer or for a warehouse facility. 
Consequently, the City has struggled to accommodate these types of uses and it has served as a 
limiting facto r on opportunities for residents with mechanical skills, that work in healthcare, or in 
professional fields to work in the City. Table 11 -2 details both the jobs that are present within the 
City and the employment of North Port residents.

11-6  Education  
In the 2010- 2014  time period , almost 90 percent  of North Port residents that were at least 25 
years  old had at least graduated  from  high school and just under 17 percent  had a bachelor's  
degree or higher.  Although  a higher percentage of North Port residents  graduated  from  high 
school than in the State  of Florida as a whole , North Port’s  college  graduation  rate is over 10 
percentage points lower than the statewide amount.  
College  programs within  the City have expanded extensively  in the past ten years  with more  four 
year programs.  Higher  educational resources  in close proximity to the City include  the State 
College of Florida and the University of South Florida Sarasota -Manatee, who share a campus just 
outside of the City in the West Villages area . The State College of Florida offers two and four -year 
degree programs while the University of South F lorida Sarasota- Manatee offers four -year and 
master’s degree programs.  
In addition to the existing educational opportunities  in the North Port area, there is a new institution 
being constructed.  Suncoast Technical College (STC), Sarasota County’s vocation al and technical 
institution, is constructing a campus at the intersection of Interstate 75 and Toledo Blade Boulevard 
that will be co -located with a branch of the Sarasota County Library System and a conference facility 
that will serve both as a training facility for STC’s culinary arts program and as a center for 
community and regional conferences. The STC campus and related facilities are expected to open 
in the late summer of 2017.

Commuting  
While North Port is the largest city in Sarasota County by area and population, there are limited 
employment opportunities located within its boundaries . While the City’s population and the 
population of southern Sarasota County (including Venice and Englewood) has grown substantially 
over the last 25 years, nearly all of the County’s employment centers have remained in the city of Sarasota in the north of the county and nearby areas. 
City residents currently face long commute times to and from their jobs and are susceptible to 
frequent delays due to traffic accidents along Interstate 75, which is the primary route connecting Sarasota and North Port. According to 2014 data from the US Census Bureau’s On the Map application, nearly 45% of all working residents had a one -way commute of at least 25 miles to 
and from their jobs. The percentage was even greater for residents making over $40,000 per year, as 49% of residents making at least this amount commute at least 25 miles each way and nearly 26% commute over 50 miles each way.

11-8  Greater detail on the nature of transportation thru North Port can be found in Chapter 3 the 
Transportation Element. 
 
Unemployment  
As of February, 2016, the  unemployment  rate for the North Port -Sarasota -Bradenton 
Metropolitan  Area (including Sarasota and Manatee Counties ) was 4.4% compared to a 
statewide  unemployment rate of  4.9% (not  seasonally  adjusted) per the Florida  Department 
of Economic Opportunity.  
 Financial  Health  and Cost  of Living 
Table 11-5 compares  North Port’s  cost of living  to other nearby  Florida  cities  and the 
nation. Based  upon the overall  cost of housing,  transportation, utilities,  and food, everyday 
costs  are lower  in North Port compared  to other cities in Southwest Florida and  the US as a 
whole.  A lower  cost of living makes  North Port  an attractive  location  for new residents  as 
well as attractive  to businesses interested  in relocating.

11-9  IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ISSUES  
Future Land Uses 
Lands with a Commercial, Office/Professional/Institutional,  or Industrial future  land use 
designation  made  up approximately 5%  of the land area of the platted areas of the City . This 
compares  to 10% commercial,  and 8% industrial  land uses based  on a national  average  of other  
similar  size communities.  Due to the platted lands nature of North Port, the creation of commercial 
and other areas designated for non -residential uses were secondary to  residential  development  in the 
City. 
The City has developed activity centers  including  sites located  near major  interchanges , at the 
intersections of arterial roadways, and along US 41. In addition, a large amount of the West Villages 
is slated to be developed for commercial uses . The City still sees a need for lands that would 
support industrial or warehouses uses, since the only area of the city where  these uses may be 
feasible under current regulations is located outside of the Urban Service Area (Activity Center 
6)  
North Port has several Developments of Regional Impact that are zoned as Planned Community 
Development (PCD) Districts. The West Villages  utilize  the Village  District future  land use 
designation. The Village  future  land use designation accounts  for approximately 20 percent  of 
the total land area in the City.  The Village  District  was created to reflect  the mixed  use nature  
of these  projects and allows  commercial , office,  and limited  industrial uses in additional  to 
residential  uses. 
As mentioned above, North Port, has few areas designated for light industrial uses at present. The two areas that are in the Urban Service Area are at Trott Circle (off of Pan American Boulevard) 
and in the southwest section of Activity Center 4. While Activity Center 6 is designated for larger 
scale industrial and office uses, as of 2016 this area is located outside of the City’s Urban Service Area. There are no services (sewer, water, or electricity) present in this area at this time and the 
roadway network would need substantial improvements (including an interchange at Yorkshire 
Boulevard and Interstate 75 along with the reconstruction of all of the roadways within the 
Activity Center) in order to support the needs of truck traffic to and from this area. While the City is looking for ways to fund these improvements, there are no plans at this time to provide these improvements in the timeframe of this Co mprehensive Plan.   
 
Tourism  
In addition  to the beaches  and coastal region s located  outside  the City within  Sarasota and Charlotte 
Counties , the increasing number of sports  and recreational  facilities  in the immediate area 
act as an additional tourist  attraction  to the area. 
The development of Nathan Benderson Park in northern Sarasota County has served to attract  
numerous national and international rowing  events to the County. The County is also hosting 
several other international and world -class level events, including the Bicycle Motocross (BMX)    
Economic Development Element  
11-10  World Cup at a new, state of the art track  in Sarasota.   North Port is also located in close proximity 
to two spring training facilities ( The Tampa Bay Rays in Charlotte County and the Baltimore 
Orioles in Sarasota). Additionally, the Snowbird Classic, a 6- week  series of college baseball games 
is annually held in North Charlotte Regional Park, located less than one mile from the City limits. 
If the proposed spring  training facility is constructed in the West Villages, North Port could become 
an attractive location for additional sports teams looking to train in Florida  and for sports 
tournaments to take place in the South County.    
Eco-tourism  is an emerging  tourism trend  that focuses  on marketing  of the environment.  Eco- 
tourism  involves  experiencing  the natural  environment  and educating  about  natural  resources  
without  threatening  the environment. The Myakka River, Myakkahatchee  Creek, Myakka State 
Forest,  and other  pristine  natural  habitats  such as the Carlton Preserve provide  ideal settings  for 
establishing  eco-tourism. Developing  this market  with activities  such as backpacking, bird 
watching,  horseback riding, canoeing,  camping, and fishing  will help expand  the tourism  season  
and reduce the unemployment  gap. 
Public  Infrastructure  
The ability  of a community  to attract  and sustain  economic  development  depends  on the quality  of 
the community's  infrastructure.  Infrastructure  includes  roadways  and bridges;  airports;  drainage  
and storm  water  facilities;  water  and wastewater  systems;  electric  generation  and transmission  
systems;  solid waste collection,  recycling  and disposal  facilities; schools;  parks;  and any other  
facility  that is basic  in daily  life. These facilities  are the skeletal  structure  that support  community  
life and economic  development. Other  elements  of this plan provide  details  on City activities  in these 
areas.  The City annually updates  the Capital  Improvements  Element  to ensure  level  of service  
standards  are met for existing  and future  development.  
Transportation  
The a
bility  to move  people, goods, and services  efficiently  is an important  part of economic  
development. While North Port is not on coastal waters, the North Port -Sarasota- Bradenton 
Metropolitan areas  has good inter-modal  transportation  access  to larger  markets  through Port 
Manatee, a deep water seaport located in northern Manatee County on Tampa Bay , and is in close 
proximity to three airports offering passenger service (Sarasota -Bradenton International, Punta Gorda 
Airport (serving low cost, tourism based airlines) and the Southwest Florida International Airport in 
Fort Myers). In addition, the proximity of these airports to Interstate 75 allows for multi -modal 
integration for freight providers . Interstate 75 traverses the City and region, while freight rail service 
exists in northern Sarasota County and from Punta Gorda southward.  
Quality  of Life 
The Suncoast  Region  enjoys  an excellent  quality  of life. The indicators  of quality  of life include  
the natural  environment,  recreation,  culture,  safety,  education,  housing  and health  services.  
The perception  of an area having  a good quality  of life is critical  for many  businesses when  
determining whether  or not to invest  in an area. A community  must  call attention  to its diversity,     
Economic Development Element  
11-11  identity,  and individuality  to attract  capital and investment.  In addition,  a community  must  
continue  efforts  to maintain  and expand the infrastructure  and other  amenities  (museums, theater,  
sports,  entertainment,  recreation)  to sustain  a quality  of life enjoyed  by residents  and found  
attractive to outside  businesses.  
North Port and Sarasota County  have  invested in quality of life through the development its park 
and recreational facilities. The City also supports public art projects and community and cultural 
events such as Halloween at City Hall, the City’s Farmers Market, jazz concerts, and holiday 
events  (Poinsettia Parade and Festival) . 
In recent years, the City of North Port has worked to promote public art and a higher level of site and building design standards than those found in cities comparable to North Port. Building upon efforts developed as part of the Heron Creek development and the planning of the West Villages, in 2010, the City created a Urban Design Standards Pattern Book for its activity center. The 
pattern book sets forth a variety of recommendations related to special  landscape treatments  and 
architectural  enhancements  for buildings and development sites . The Public  Art Program  requires  
all new development requiring a site plan or site plan amendment  to provide  public art or to fund 
the development of public art to be placed within Activity Centers.  
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES  
Targeted  Industries  
The City of North Port, as part of its economic development strategy, has identified several target 
industries that it seeks to attract into the City. The identification of these industries assists in  
providing direction  in its economic development programming. The City intends to focus on 
industries  that have the potential  for long- term employment of North Port residents  and that will 
contribute to the City’s  overall quality  of life. As the City has grown and developed over the 
years its demographic base and economic make -up has evolved. The target industries for the 
period of 2007-2013 were: Education, Healthcare, Hospitality, Light Manufacturing, Retail Trade.  
Upon direction of Commission and as necessitated by a fast changing economy, an economic 
development strategic plan was written in 2012 which provide d an updated framework that seeks 
to align the City’s economic development efforts with Sarasota County’s while also focusing  on 
the specific sectors which have the highest potential to help diversify the North Port economy.  
The City’s  economic development efforts must refocus attention on programs to support existing 
businesses and existing job skills. Further economic diversification is also needed through 
continued development of the following Sarasota County Industries: 
• Medical & Life Sciences  
• Applied Environment Services & Sustainable Systems 
• Digital Media & Web -enabled Technologies  
• Creative Services  
• Specialty Manufacturing     
Economic Development Element  
11-12  While developing the new target industries identified for the City of North Port, the City must 
maintain the City’s existing assets which include: Education, Logistics/Distribution, Retail Trade, Construction and Real Estate, Tourism and by products of Warm Mineral Springs. In addition, the City should expand support for entrepreneurs. 
 
Economic Development  Accomplishments  
County -wide accomplishments  
The City continues  to diversify  the local  economy  and create jobs. The State  College  of Florida 
and the University of South Florida Sarasota -Manatee  have facilities  located  within North Port  
providing excellent  higher  education  opportunities  to North Port residents .  With the impending 
development of the Suncoast Technical College, there will be additional opportunities to develop 
relationships between employers and training opportunities that are targeted to employer needs.  
In recent  years,  the City in partnership with Sarasota County and the Economic Development  
Council (EDC)  of Sarasota County to recruit a variety of businesses to North Port . 
City-wide accomplishments  
The City has been successful in recruiting viable businesses in all 5 sectors of the target 
industries in the first economic development strategic plans. As the Cit y’s population grew 
more than three -fold since the year 2000, residents and businesses now have an array of choices 
in the fields of education, health care, hospitality and retail trade. Light manufacturing is alive 
and well in the City with the share of employment in the light industrial and manufacturing 
sectors being higher compared to that of the state’s. The City has also been successful in bringing in additional light industrial and light manufacturing companies to locate to North 
Port, adding to the decent number of these companies already operating in the City.   
In addition to its recruitment efforts, the City is at the forefront in the field of Business 
Retention and Expansion. Underscoring its philosophy of bein g a facilitator of market -driven 
growth, the City’s economic development programming is geared toward supporting and 
assisting the organic growth of the local economy. The City took this philosophy one step further by creating the function of business advocacy.  Recognizing the inherent challenge in 
competing in the national and international arena, North Port focused its attention to ensuring the City’s development code and its execution  of the regulatory process remains pro -business 
and business -friendly.   
Efforts are now underway to leverage City resources with the state’s the region’s to further expand the economic base of North Port, focusing on the target industries under the existing economic 
development strategic plan. The implementation of the City’s economic development strategic 
plan utilizes four major activity groupings:  
 
• Business Retention and Expansion    
Economic Development Element  
11-13  • Business attraction and recruitment 
• Business climate improvement 
• Regional collaboration  
 
Economic  Development Incentives  
The City of North Port and Sarasota County have a number of incentives  for business to relocate  
to Sarasota  County.  They  include: 
• Job Growth  Investment  Grant  
• Economic Development Ad Valorem  Tax Exemption  
• Economic Development Impact Fee Mitigation  
• Foreign  Trade Zone 
• Brownfield Site  
• Franchise Fee  Rebate 
The City of North Port  supports creation  of new business by holding new business training  
classes  through its Small Business Assistance Program. This Program supports entrepreneurship 
at the initial stages, during the development and growth of small businesses, and also through the 
facilitation and provision of alternative financing sources . These programs then complement  the 
following State  of Florida  economic development incentives  to create a more robust business 
attraction strategy : 
• Sales  and Use Tax Exemptions  
• Qualified  Target Industry Grant  
• Capital Investment Tax  Credit 
• High  Impact  Performance Grant  
• Infrastructure  Incentive Road  Fund 
Economic Development  History  and Trends  
The economic  emphasis  of the then-named  General  Development  Corporation  (GDC)  the 
original creators  of North Port , was the platting  of residential  lots for sale.  The population at the time 
was less than one hundred residents in the 104 square  miles  that are within the  City limits.  
As time passed  GDC  succeeded  in selling  most  of the 65,000 residential  lots they had platted  in 
what was then North Port Charlotte and the additional 120,000 platted lots located in Port Charlotte . 
Low cost of living,  sub-tropical  climate  and a centralized  location  between Sarasota and Fort Myers  
influenced population growth. While the population was slow to grow initially, the completion of 
Interstate 75 in the late 1980’s spurred a population boom, from just over 11,000 residents in 1990    
Economic Development Element  
11-14  to the over 62,000 residents that call North Port home today.  
While the population of North Port has grown substantially, employment within the City, 
particularly for jobs paying a living wage, have been slow in coming. Over 2 out of every 3 workers leave the North Port area to commute to jobs in nearby communities, including Sarasota, Veni ce, 
and Port Charlotte. With few exceptions ( King Plastic and other small scale manufactures ), the 
majority of jobs with private entities located in the City are in lower income service based industries  
This trend  continues  today  and has created  two situations;  a higher  than average  unemployment  
rate, particularly for younger residents and a higher  than average  rate of people  working  outside  the 
community.  
The lack of planned areas  for economic development  was not a major problem  in the early  days of 
the City’s  growth  as the city was originally intended to be a retirement based community, attracting 
mainly seniors that would not need a large amount of commercial,  office,  and industrial  uses to 
support  the early  population and their needs . As time  progressed  and the City’s population grew  at 
a rapid  pace it transitioned into a bedroom community for areas in northern Sarasota County . 
The lack of areas  for larger scale economic  development , particularly for industrial and office uses  
became apparent. In the recently annexed areas of the city that were not platted by GDC (West 
Villages), the City has required development to create and adhere to a village district pattern plan 
(VDPP). Within the Heron Creek Development of Regional Impact, t he City worked with the master 
developer to  create land use conversion  zones that allow  conversion from residential land use to 
commercial,  office,  institutional,  and multi- family  uses within the DRI.  This has helped  relieve  
some  of the shortage  of land available for economic  development.  The Future  Land  Use 
Element  of this  plan expands on land use changes needed  to create new commercial  centers  in the 
City.  
 
CONCLUSION   
The City wishes  to diversify  the local  economy  and improve  economic  and employment  
opportunities  for North Port residents. As such,  the City’s role is to create the best possible  
environment  for economic  development  opportunities  that will benefit  the City's  residents.  The 
City's  business  climate should encourage  the creation,  expansion,  retention  and relocation  of 
businesses.  This goal can be achieved  if the City pursues  the following  objectives:  1) endeavor  to 
ensure  that adequate areas  of commercial and industrial  parcels  exist to meet  current  and future  
needs;  2) provide  the proper  regulatory  and financial  incentives  to encourage  beneficial  
development  of those  areas;  3) continue  to provide  recreational  and cultural activities  that will both 
serve its residents and to attract visitors and economic development into the City , and 4) support  
educational  training  and opportunities  to enhance the quality  of life of the City’s residents and to 
serve to improve the skillsets of the City’s employment base . Cooperation  with other  government  
agencies,  the private sector,  and the public  to insure  that the directions  taken  by the  City  in regard  
to economic  development  meet common  needs  and goals is essential.     
Economic Development Element  
11-15  The City also has a variety  of means  at its disposal  to accomplish  these objectives  that include  but 
are not limited  to: 
• Provide  infrastructure that will support  expansion  of industry.  
• Consider  future  Comprehensive  Plan  Amendments  to change land  uses to encourage  both a 
high quality of development within the Activity Centers and the expansion of 
employment opportunities that match the skills of the City’s residents.  
• Minimize  development  of single  family  residences in activity centers while encouraging 
mixed use development that would include office and commercial uses with multi- family 
residential development.  
• Advocate  Economic  Development  Ad Valorem  Tax Exemption  for new and expanding  
businesses  offering new jobs, as recently  approved by referendum.  
• Discourage  any reduction  of commercial  and industrial  land through  zoning  or land use 
change.  
• Work with regional economic development partners to foster and promote mutual interests that expand the economic base  
• Continue  to provide lively  community  events  and facilities  for community  events.  
The Goals,  Objectives,  and Policies  that follow  this section  are a means  to help realize  orderly , 
sustainable economic growth. L and use planning,  zoning, and fiscal  policy  should encourage  
patterns  of development  that will foster  redevelopment  and infill of existing  commercial  areas,  
and cause new areas  to form  in a way that will increase viable  locations  for economic  development.  
The Future  Land  Use Element  of this plan also furthers  this concept  by designating  compact  
centralized  locations  including  commercial  nodes  and mixed  use within  the City suitable  for 
expanded  commercial  activity . "

This annotated bibliography was initially developed from literature
related to the economics and biology of the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic
shrimp fisheries.  In the process of assembling this information, it became
apparent that much of the research done for other fisheries and in other
fields of economics had relevance to the economic and biological problems in
the shrimp fishery.  For example, an analysis to address the policy
implications of bycatch discards in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery would
draw on research done by fishery biologists, descriptions and analyses of the
problem in other fisheries around the world, and the economic analysis of air
and water pollution.  As a result, the bibliography became much more extensive
then originally planned.  While not meant to be a comprehensive listing of all
fisheries related economic and biological research, hopefully, it will serve
as a useful reference for researchers attempting to analyze proposed fishery
management regulations.
The abstracts, where possible, were taken directly from the cited
articles and books.  An index of author names by subject has been included in
this annotated bibliography that will be updated as new information becomes
available.  Individuals interested in having specific references included in
future editions may do so by sending a copy of the article or text to the
Southeast Regional Office in care of the editor.  This information is also
available on diskette for IBM compatible personal computers.
I would like to extend my appreciation to the people who assisted in
this project.  I would like to acknowledge Richard Raulerson, Assistant
Regional Director for Economics and Trade Analysis, Southeast Regional Office,
National Marine Fisheries Service for his support of this project and whose
idea it was to assemble and publish the information.  Dr. John Vondruska
provided the information on shrimp processing and situation and outlook
reports for shrimp.  The staff at the NOAA library in Silver Spring, Maryland
tracked down most of the literature cited in the bibliography.  Lastly, I
appreciate the help of the authors who provided copies of contract reports,
staff reports, and other ""gray"" literature that I could not find elsewhere.iiTable of Contents

knowledge of summer flounder distribution, life history patterns and stock
identification.  This is followed by a synopsis of habitat requirements during
each life history stage.  For convenience, this is presented by general
habitat as offshore eggs, offshore larvae, estuarine larvae, estuarine
juveniles, offshore juveniles, and estuarine and offshore adults.  In several
instances, previously undigested data sets are analyzed to provide more
detailed information, especially for estuarine juveniles.  The information is
then discussed in terms of its relevance to resource managers.
Abrams, Burton A. (1985).   The Expansion of Fishery Jurisdiction: Fishery
Interests and Congressional Voting.   Marine Resource Economics ,

The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 greatly
broadened the scope of U.S. fishery regulation.  While the act contained a
variety of features, its primary and certainly most controversial provision
expanded the regulated fishing zone from 12 to 200 miles.  This paper
identifies the primary gainers and losers from the act and assesses their
roles in influencing the legislative outcome.  The voting behavior of
congressional representatives is analyzed by multi variate probit analysis to
quantify the influences of the major lobbying groups.
Abramson, Norman J. and Patrick K. Tomlinson (1972).  ""An Application of
Yield Models to a California Ocean Shrimp Population.""  Fishery
Bulletin , 70(3):1021-1041.
Two types of yield models were utilized to analyze fishery data from
California's northern most bed of ocean shrimp, Pandalus  jordani .  The
Schaefer form of the stock production model was applied to catch and effort
data for the years 1954 through 1969.  Age-structured catch data for 1955
through 1968 were analyzed by the Murphy method to obtain mortality rates and
biomass estimates.  Catchability coefficients and a growth curve were also2estimated.  Attempts to fit spawner-recruit models to estimates obtained from
the age-structured catch data were inconclusive; so, age specific mortality
and growth estimates were only used to fit a yield-per-recruit model.  After
comparing the results from the two models, the Schaefer model was deemed most
suitable for managing this fishery.  The model estimated the maximum
sustainable yield at 2.46 million pounds.  A strategy for managing the fishery
under a quota system was proposed.
Acheson, James M. (1984).  ""Government Regulation and Exploitive
Capacity: The Case of the New England Groundfishery.""  Human
Organization , 43(4):319-329.
The U.S. Fisheries Conservation and Management Act was designed to
control the exploitation of commercial marine species.  However, during the
first two years after this act went into effect in New England in 1977, the
overall economic and regulatory environment sent fishermen a mixed set of
signals.  Some factors, including aspects of regulation, stimulated expansion
of the groundfishing fleet; others had the opposite effect.
Two surveys indicated fishermen were unhappy with the regulations and
believed federal regulation would drive them out of business and lead to the
demise of the industry.  However, a study of the fleet uncovered the fact that
fishermen were purchasing bigger, more versatile boats equipped with more
sophisticated electronic gear.  In addition, the number of ground fishing
boats increased dramatically.  Regulations were only one of a number of
factors influencing the decisions of fishermen.  The age of the fleet,
increased catches and prices for fish, the increase in competition due to the
quota regulations themselves, and the economic difficulties in other fisheries
all played a role.  The fact that regulation helped to produce a fleet with
more capacity to exploit fish stocks raises some key questions about ways to
generate effective, equitable resource management policies.
Adams, Charles M. (1984).  ""Price Dynamics in the U.S. Shrimp Market.""
Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Food and Resource Economics,
University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.
Understanding the mechanism of price determination in a dynamic setting
is imperative to formulating effective policy and assessing price impacts at
each market level.  This study examines the monthly and quarterly price
determination process for raw-headless shrimp of the 31-40 and 21-25 size
classes.  Price response between market levels for both size classes was found
to be symmetric.  However, policy measures that alter the quantity or size
distribution of shrimp through import quotas, tariffs, or seasonal
restrictions, will have a greater price impact on the smaller shrimp. 
Increased supplies of maricultural shrimp will have a greater relative price
impact on the 31-40 size class.

The purpose of this paper is to briefly describe the trends in
production, prices, and value of yellowfin tuna in the Gulf and south Atlantic
region, virtually all of which is destined for the fresh market.  Yellowfin
production activities in the Gulf and south Atlantic region will be addressed
with respect to world and total U.S. yellowfin landings.  In addition, recent
trends in fresh/frozen yellowfin tuna imports will be examined.
Adams, Charles M. (1993).  ""A Preliminary Assessment of Ex-vessel Price
Movements in the South Atlantic Rock Shrimp Fishery.""  Report to
the Staff of the South Atlantic Regional Fisheries Management
Council, November 23, 13 pp.
The primary objective of this study is to examine the dockside pricing
structure of rock shrimp and determine if dockside prices per pound are an
increasing function of size of shrimp.  Secondarily, the importance of demand
shifters (income and availability of substitutes) in the determination of
dockside prices is determined.  The benefits of a closure that allows shrimp
to grow into the larger size category is questionable because of the long life
of the rock shrimp (20-22 months) and the common property nature of the
fishery.

This paper provides a brief descriptive overview of the commercial and
recreational fishing industries in the Gulf of Mexico.  The importance of each
industry within the Gulf region and relative to the U.S. is addressed.  Trends
in landings, effort, and participation are discussed.  State specific data
will be provided where possible.  In addition, the current management
structure which is charged with establishing policy and regulating the marine
fisheries resources within the state and federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico
is described.  Finally, current problematic issues and opportunities
concerning the commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf region are
discussed.

Timber supply behavior of private forest owners is a major uncertainty
in long-term forest product market projections.  A model of private supply is
developed that explains both harvest and forest management investment
decisions.  Comparison of two fifty year projections, one assuming constant
management intensity and a second using the harvest investment model,
indicates that projected levels of investment would have little impact on
markets prior to the year 2000, stabilize real wood product prices after 2000,
eliminate softwood lumber imports by 2030, and expand the dominant role of
southern forest regions in wood product markets.

 Seasonal Occurrence of the White Shark, Carcharodon  carcharias , in
Waters off the Florida West Coast, with Notes on its Life History.  
Marine Fisheries Review , 56(4):24-28.
The white shark, Carcharodon  carcharias , is considered rare in the Gulf
of Mexico; however, recent longline captures coupled with historical landings
information suggest that the species occurs seasonally (winter-spring) within
this region.  We examined a total of seven adult and juvenile white sharks
(185-472 cm total length) captured in waters off the west coast of Florida.  
Commercial longline fisheries were monitored for white sharks during all
months (1981-94), but this species was captured only from January to April. 
All white sharks were captured in continental shelf waters from 37 to 222 km
off the west coast of Florida when sea surface temperatures ranged from 18.7o
to 21.6oC.  Depths at capture locations ranged from 20 to 164 m.  Fishing gear
typically used in Gulf of Mexico offshore fisheries may not be effective at
capturing this species, and the apparent rarity of white sharks in this area
may be, in part, a function of gear bias.

The goals and structure of the limited entry program in Alaska were
defined by the political, social, economic, and biological climates in which
the program was implemented.  This paper outlines how these considerations
formed the program and discusses the impacts of the program and the problems
involved in its implementation.  Other possible modes of approaching entry
limitation are discussed in relation to the possibility of limiting some
currently unlimited fisheries.

described.  The construction of these plans is based upon the principle of
proportional frequencies of the factor levels.  The possibilities of blocking
these main effect plans, the randomization procedure and the method of
analysis are presented.5Addelman, Sidney (1962).  ""Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Fractional

Procedures for constructing plans that permit uncorrelated estimation of
all main effects and some specified number of two factor interaction effects
are developed for symmetrical factorial arrangements.  These plans can then be
adjusted to yield plans with similar properties for asymmetrical factorial
experiments.

Louisiana Shrimp Fishery.""  Final report, MARFIN Grant No. NA89WC-
H-MF006, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, Office of
Fisheries, Post Office Box 189, Bourg, Louisiana.
This project was designed to survey nearshore, inshore and wingnet
shrimp fishermen in coastal Louisiana, and assess the number, species
composition, and weight of all incidentally caught organisms.  The project
objective was to assess the groundfish bycatch of the Louisiana shrimp
fishery, including effects of gear type, season, and location.  In trawls, an
average fish/shrimp ratio by weight was 3.21:1, yielding an estimated total
annual bycatch of 228 million pounds.  The report contains a review of

Fisheries Management.   In Karyn L. Gimbel (ed.) Limiting Access to
Marine Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on Conservation , Center for Marine
Conservation and the World Wildlife Fund, Washington, D.C.
The use of closed areas in fisheries, also known as harvest refugia,
presents an effective way to conserve stocks and habitats threatened by over
exploitation, destructive fishing, and indirect degradation caused by
pollution or the trickle down effects of poor resource management in the
vicinity.  Such area closures may be established as a fisheries management
tool, or may be a component of a wider array of spatially defined management
measures such as exist in a multiple use protected area, a biosphere reserve,
or a coastal management plan.  Among the benefits that the designation of
closed areas accrue are conservation of stocks and species, maintenance of
genetic diversity, protection of spawning stock biomass, reduction in growth
overfishing, simplicity in being able to explain the management measure,
relative ease of enforcement, provision of a baseline to monitor condition of
stocks and the productivity or health of the ecosystem, and insurance against
management failure.  By providing a means to target differential pressures
applied to different stocks and different age groups, the closed area
designation comes closest to approximating ecosystem based, comprehensive
management.  However, the potential high costs relating to exclusion of
certain users, the mechanics of boundary delineation, scientific uncertainties
relating to identification of ecologically critical areas, lost opportunity,
and the spill over of potentially increasing fishing pressure outside the
limits of the closed area all necessitate that managers evaluate costs and
benefits carefully before using closed areas to complement other forms of
fisheries management.

Property Rights in the Fisheries.""  Land Economics , 52(4):518-529.
In fisheries subject to a grounds quality externality, such as the
oyster industry, the establishment of exclusive user rights may actually lead6to increases in employment.  An econometric analysis demonstrates that
productivity from the oyster grounds is larger under a property rights system
relative to a common property resource, but no empirical evidence is offered
that supports the theoretical conclusion that employment will increase.
Agnello, Richard J. and Lawrence P. Donnelley (1976). ""Prices and
Property Rights in the Fisheries.""  Southern Economic Journal ,
42(Oct.):5253-262.
When fish harvesting is treated as a common property resource,
distortions occur in the intraseasonal production patterns of the industry in
the form of relatively large intraseasonal price variation with common
property when no private property alternatives exist.  When both private and
common property supplies are present, common property price distortions take
the form of lower ex-vessel prices.
Agnello, Richard J. and Yunqi Han (1993).  ""Substitute Site Measures in
a Varying Parameter Model with Application to Recreational
Fishing.""  Marine Resource Economics , 8(1):65-77.
This paper employs a varying parameter travel cost model to determine
the economic valuation of fishing trips and catch for a sample of Long Island
anglers.  Substitution measures in the model are characterized in terms of the
number and the quality of proximate alternative sites.  This treatment of
substitution as a site rather than an individual characteristic helps to
define a site's uniqueness and in addition provides a feasible means of
capturing substitution effects when measures of substitution at an individual
level are not available.  Per trip consumer surplus and changes in consumer
surplus due to catch changes are computed and distinguished by controls for
the availability and quality of substitute sites.  Consumer surplus and the
valuation of changes in catch are found to be substantially lower when
controlling for substitution effects which is in agreement with most previous
studies.

Measures that will be taken in the Pacific Northwest to recover three
Snake River wild salmon runs protected under the Endangered Species Act and to
improve the Columbia River Basin salmon fishery as a whole will result in
various benefits and costs to the Northwest economy.  This repot, which
describes the principal findings of a larger USDA study, analyzes the effect
of Snake River management alternatives on agricultural production, profit, and
resource use in the Northwest.  Measures examined include reservoir drawdown
along the Lower Snake River and irrigation water supply reductions in the
Upper Snake River Basin.  For the Northwest region, adjustments in
agricultural crop production cause producer profit to decrease by less than
$10 million per year (less than 1 percent in baseline profit) under five of
the seven scenarios.  Two scenarios would reduce profit $30-35 million per
year (2-3 percent of baseline).  This report also examines secondary impacts
on regional income and employment that result from the adjustments in
agricultural production.  Agricultural employment could decrease by 50 to
2,600 jobs, depending on the scenario, while total employment could decrease
by 600 to 5,500 jobs.  Finally, this report discusses selected economic
benefits of salmon recovery, including improvements in commercial and sport
fishing.

Valuation Surveys: Single-Bound, Double-Bound, and Bivariate Models.  
Journal of Environmental Economics and Management , 28:287-306.
This paper finds the designs for discrete choice contingent valuation
surveys that maximize the precision of a statistic of interest about the
public s willingness to pay (WTP) for a change in the environmental quality,
such as median WTP.  An optimization problem is set up, in which the
efficiency of the estimate of median WTP (or a related concept) is the
objective function to optimize with respect to the survey design (i.e., the
set of bids offered to the respondents).  In deriving the optimal designs, we
consider alternative econometric models, such as the basic  single-bound 
model that uses the responses to the first payment question, the traditional
interval data (or  double-bound ) model for surveys with a follow-up payment
question, and the recently proposed bivariate binary response model. 
Simulations are carried out to compare the alternative design principles and
assess their performances with respect to the statistic of primary interest,
median WPT, and other welfare measures, such as mean WTP.  Other designs that
are constructed ad hoc are also examined.8Alcala, A.C. and G.R. Russ (1990).   A Direct Test of the Effects of
Protective Management on Abundance and Yield of Tropical Marine
Resources.   J. Cons. Int. Explor. Mer. , 46:40-47.
Despite a vast body of traditional knowledge on management of marine
resources in the tropics, there are few direct tests utilizing manipulative or
natural experiments of the effect of protective management on the abundance of
marine resources and, more importantly, their yield.  This paper reports on a
natural experiment that makes such a direct test.  Approximately 25% of the
sub-tidal coral reef of Sumilon Island (total reef area to 30 m isobath = 0.5
square km) in the central Philippines was protected from all forms of
exploitation from 1974 until May 1984.  Cessation of protective management led
to fishing of the entire coral reef.  This resulted in a significant reduction
in abundance within the previously protected area of the fishes which
constituted the majority of the yield from the reef.  Catch per unit effort
measure over a one year period eighteen months after protective management
ceased was significantly less than that measured over a one year period before
protective management ceased.  There was a decline of 54% in the total yield
of reef fishes from Sumilon Island reef between 1983/1984 and 1985/1986
despite the fact that only 75% of the reef was fished in 1983/1984.  The yield
from traps and gill nets (approximately 64% of the total yield) from the whole
reef in 1985/1986 was significantly less than the average yield of the
nonreserve (75% of the reef) measured during three of the years of protection. 
Similarly, the yield from traps (approximately 45% of the total yield) in
1985/1986 was significantly less than the average yield of the nonreserve (75%
of the reef) measured during six of the years of protection.  Protective
management maintained high abundances of fishes in the reserve and
significantly higher yields to fishermen from areas adjacent to the reserve. 
Migration of adult fish from the reserve to the nonreserve area during
protection is the simplest explanation of these results.

A forest harvest scheduling model that includes as activities the level

in more typical Model II formulations of the harvest scheduling problem.  The
optimal harvest and investment policy can be determined by linear programming
or quadratic programming methods, depending on whether prices are constant or
supply dependent.  The new model better reflects economic reality than
existing models, and provides a method for determining the optimal economic
development of a forest industry, and the optimal draw-down of old growth
forest.  Numerical examples are given.

Modern cropshare contracts are explained using a model in which agents
are risk neutral and contract rules are chosen to maximize expected joint
wealth.  It is shown that the farmer either bears the entire cost of inputs or
shares the costs with the landowner in the same proportion as the output.  The
incentives of altering the cropshare percentage are examined and are used to
derive implications about the portion of the crop that will be owned by the
farmer.  The model is tested and supported using data from a 1986 survey of
farmers and landowners in Nebraska and South Dakota.

The basis of current models used in fishery management is briefly
examined, and various shortcomings are discussed.  Alternative, dynamic models
are described that are based on the data available for the Nova Scotia
Groundfish Fisheries.  It is shown that human responses can amplify relatively
small annual environmental fluctuations, leading to large, quasi-cyclic
changes in catch and profit.  In a detailed spatial model it is shown that
stochastic behavior on the part of some fishermen is necessary for the
survival of the fishery, and that the efficiency and size of the industry
depends very much on the information flows concerning catch.  A very general
discussion is given that shows how these ideas are important in our
understanding of innovation and discovery in general terms.

Stability, entry, exit, and mobility patterns for six size categories of
firms in the Florida shrimp processing industry for the 1959-71 period were
studied by utilizing Markov Chain analysis.  Forecasts over time predict that
a structural equilibrium in the industry will be achieved by 1985.  The
forecasted changes in firm distribution suggest that Florida shrimp industry
sales will become increasingly concentrated due to expansion in number of both
small and large firms.  A dual equilibrium, resulting in fewer medium size
firms and more small and large size firms, can be explained by the tendency
for small firms to develop a specialty product and/or services to
differentiate their markets from those of the very large firms.  Medium sized
firms, then, tend to expand in size, or decline and either move to specialty
products and services or exit from the industry.

Bycatch of discards is not a new fisheries management problem.  Bycatch
has been with us as an integral component of fishing since humans began to use
the world seas, lakes, rivers, and streams as sources of food.  What is new,
however, is the explosive growth of bycatch as a major management issue over
the past decade and the formal national and international recognition that
bycatch in many world fisheries constitutes important waste and raises
conservation, ecological, and economic issues requiring the priority attention
of managers.  This paper provides: (1) a cursory review of the recent
development of bycatch policy, (2) presentation of bycatch as a problem in
world fisheries, (3) discussion of bycatch as a component of fishing induced
mortalities with examples of graphics and tabular presentations of information

An average of 27 million tons of fish are discarded each year in

the top of the list.  The authors point to inadequate data to determine the
biological, ecological, economic, and cultural impacts of discards although
economic losses run to billions of dollars.  However, it appears most likely
that socio-cultural attitudes towards marine resources will guide
international discard policies.  Techniques to reduce bycatch levels including
traditional net selectivity, fishing gear development and time/area
restrictions are discussed.  Effort reduction, incentive programmes and
individual transferable quotas (that make the vessel responsible for bycatch
reduction) are seen as promising avenues for the future.  However, quick
solutions to the problem are unlikely and much more information is required.

Qualitative response (QR) models developed between 1970 and 1981 are
reviewed in this article with special attention paid to (1) the specification
of a model that is consistent with economic theory and is statistically
manageable, (2) the estimation of model parameters and the hypothesis tests
based on those estimated parameters, and (3) the criteria to use in choosing
among competing models.  First, univariate dichotomous dependent variable
models are developed, such as the biometric applications of insect survival
(survive = 1, death = 0) as a function of insecticide dosage.  Next,
multinomial or multi-response models are developed for the case of choice of
occupation, housing, transportation choice, etc.  Lastly, multivariate models
are presented where more than one discrete dependent variable exists, e.g.
determination of the probability of catching a fish given the probability that
one takes a recreational fishing trip P(Y=1 %X=1).  Since the same set of
discrete data can be analyzed by many different QR models, this survey is most
useful as a guide in choosing an appropriate QR model from an economic-
theoretic and a statistical view point.

The deterministic models applied in economics of fisheries are extended
to comprise price uncertainty and risk aversion among the fishing units.  It
is proved that in the open access fishery both the total fishing effort and
the number of fishing units are reduced as the variance of the price
increases; that the total fishing effort may be smaller in the open access
fishery than in the optimal fishery at a high variance; that only a fixed
producer price system can create a first best optimum, and that a tax on
revenue is more efficient than both fishing unit quotas or tax on catch.

This chapter establishes the basic bioeconomic framework that is an
extension of the conventional micro firm and industry framework to account for
what most regard as the most fundamental aspects of the fishery.  The first
unique feature to account for is that production involves extraction or
harvest of a renewable natural resource.  The second unique feature is that
most fisheries are under open access, that is property rights are not private
and exclusive.

Marine Resource Economics , 3(3):183-207.
There is a wide variety of regulatory instruments available for
achieving economic efficiency in markets where externalities exist.  All of
them, when correctly designed, are equally effective, provided that complete
information is available and that adjustments to the level of the instruments15can be made costlessly.  However, with the presence of uncertainty, it is well
known that one instrument or another may produce a higher expected present
value of net social benefits than the others.  How uncertainty affects the
choice of instrument specifically in fishery management and in other dynamic
optimization settings is less well known.  A combination discrete time and
continuous time stochastic model of a dynamic fishery is used to compare the
relative performance of a per unit tax and quota in this paper.  The analysis
confirms the conclusion reached in the general literature on optimal
instrument choice under uncertainty: which instrument performs most
efficiently depends on the specific fishery being regulated.

This article presents a simple combination discrete time/ continuous
time model that incorporates continuous population dynamics and fishing
activity together with periodic, rather than continuous, instrument adjustment
into the decision process for choosing the optimal type and level of
regulatory instrument.  A per unit tax and an allocated instantaneous harvest
rate quota each drive the system along different time paths, and each results
in a different present value of the stream of net benefits generated by
harvesting the resource.  The choice of instruments is fishery specific; it
depends on the parameter values of the fishery in question.

Industry Faced with Competing New Technology: The Case of
Aquaculture and the Commercial Fishery.""  Agricultural Experiment
Station Contribution #2286, Department of Resource Economics,
University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island, December.
Technological change in the form of aquaculture is becoming an important
factor in the market for several species of fish.  In light of these changes,
producers in some ocean based fisheries need to evaluate their production and
pricing strategies relative to their emerging competitor aquaculture.  This
paper conceptually analyses the optimal pricing/production strategy for an
ocean based fishery facing a lagged decreasing net demand resulting from the
entry of competitive aquaculturalists.
The analysis indicates that the optimal strategy consists of initially
raising price to a maximum level to earn some fast profits taking advantage of
the lagged decline in net demand.  After the demand declines and natural fish
stocks are reduced such that the singular arc is reached, price is adjusted
downward to maintain the singular arc approach to the long run equilibrium. 
In the long run, price will be lower, natural fish stocks will be higher, and
natural fish supply may either be lower or higher depending on the initial
position of the system and the magnitude of the net demand shift.
Anderson, James L. (1985). ""Market Interactions Between Aquaculture and
the Common-Property Commercial Fishery."" Marine Resource
Economics , 2(1):1-24.
Market interactions between the common property commercial fishery and
(1) competitive aquaculturists and (2) a dominant firm aquaculturist are
modeled.  It is found that the entry of an competitive aquaculturist increases
natural fish stocks, reduces price, and increases total supply.  If initially
the natural fish sock is at a level below maximum sustainable yield, entry of
the aquaculturist results in an increase in supply from the commercial
fishery.  In the second part, the aquaculturist is modeled as a dominant firm. 
In some situations, the aquaculturist behaves in a manner similar to the
competitive case, but impacts on price, fish stock, and efficiency will not be
as large.  It is shown that there also exits cases where the dominant17aquaculturist will desire to promote overexploitation of the natural fish
stock.

coastal, (2) Columbia River region, and (3) Oregon/California coastal, using
pooled time series and cross sectional data.  Two functional forms were
compared: the Beverton- Holt and Ricker models.  Both models yielded very
similar results.  In both cases, we found that the natural coho stock
recruitment is significantly affected by parent stock level (positive), parent
stock density (negative), river flow (positive), and hatchery smolt release
(negative).  The significant factors affecting hatchery coho salmon were smolt
release level (positive), smolt release density (negative), and upwelling
(positive).

The emergence of large scale salmon ranching in the Pacific Northwest
has led to significant controversy over the potential impact of salmon19ranching on market structure, salmon prices, ocean and aquacultural
production, and salmon fishing regulation.  This paper models the behavior of
a dominant salmon rancher facing a competitive open access fishery using a
dynamic nonlinear programming model.  Primary attention is given to production
and regulation influencing strategies of an optimally managed salmon ranch
under selected institutional and biological constraints.  The effect of such
behavior is evaluated with regard to salmon prices, natural salmon stocks,
ocean fishing effort, and ocean fishery productivity.

Variable Price of Output.""  J. Fish. Res. Board Can. , 30:509-518.
The majority of work done in the economics of fisheries uses the
assumption of a fixed price of output.  This paper describes the effects on
the traditional fisheries model of relaxing this assumption, the most
important of which, as far as regulation agencies are concerned, are the
negation of marginal cost of effort equaling marginal revenue of effort as the
criterion for a social optimum, and the introduction of the possibility of
multiple equilibria and multiple industry profit maxima.  Also, some new
insights on fishery management with variable price and different assumptions
about the number of fisheries and the number of countries involved are pointed
out.

Fisheries may be interdependent because of biological relationships that
exist between their stocks or because the gear of one affects mortality in the
stock of the other.  The problems of defining a maximum sustainable yield in
these cases are discussed.  A graphical analysis is used to describe the
combinations of effort from both fisheries where concurrent exploitation is
possible and which of these combinations will result in a simultaneous
equilibrium.  Finally the conditions for a combined maximum economic yield
(MEY) are presented and it is shown that they will not hold if each fishery is
managed to obtain an individual MEY.

This model extends the McConnell and Sutinen (1979) and Bishop and
Samples (1980) models of recreational fishing with and without joint
commercial harvest by incorporating a stock externality in the form of a
demand curve for recreational fishing.  The effect each participant has on
others, in terms of quality and quantity, is central to an intuitive
understanding of recreational fisheries management and it can be clearly
demonstrated in the demand curve model presented in the paper.  The model is
applicable to a number of relevant problems, including joint recreation-
commercial exploitation, but here it is only applied to the optimization of
enhancement, a topic that has not been treated previously.

The traditional bionomic fisheries model is expanded to a ""bioregunomic""
model by including as an independent part of the system those regulation
agencies and institutions that grant authority to manage and that use that
authority to devise, implement, and enforce specific regulations.  In this
approach, the type of regulation used is endogenous to the model.  Several
examples of these models are introduced to show the difference between a
bioregunomic yield and either open access or maximum economic yield.  Special
emphasis is given to the ways in which the regulatory process can add
uncertainty to fisheries utilization.

A major concept in fisheries management is the optimal age for first
capture.  Because there can be separate market categories for fish of
different sizes and different costs for their harvest, a more rational
statement of the problem would be to find the optimal range of harvest sizes
in any given year.  Two models for solving this problem are presented.  The
shrimp model discusses optimal harvest of a single cohort of shrimp as it
grows through a season.  The lobster model discusses optimal simultaneous
harvest of several cohorts over several seasons.  The difficulty of defining a
cost per fish in the lobster model makes it a much more complex undertaking.

can achieve ability to comply; ease of distinction between honest mistakes,
sloppy practices, and deliberate cheating; initial versus continued
compliance; ease with which requirements can be communicated; ease with which
noncompliance can be disguised; ease with which agents can detect
noncompliance such that it is admissible as evidence; degree to which personal
or social benefits from compliance can be demonstrated; potential for citizen
cooperation identifying offenders; likelihood of encouraging rent seeking
behavior by industry and of administrators being susceptible to it; ease with
which illegal activities can be detected under various conditions; relative
ability to which enforcement is efficacious with respect to different
management objectives; and ease with which benefit-based priorities for
enforcement can be identified.

This report builds a conceptual model in which any number of practical

discussed.  The topics that are given specific attention, however, are the
nature of management rent, the workings of the market for ITQs, resource

Anderson, Lee G. (1991).  ""Note: A Note of Market Power in ITQ
Fisheries."" Journal of Environmental Economics and Management ,
21:291-296.
Individual transferable quotas, ITQs, in fisheries are analogous to
transferable pollution permits in environmental policy.  However, they are
different in that the right to produce is for the final product, the fish,
whereas pollution permits are for a nonmarket joint product (i.e., sulfur
dioxide) of the good produced for sale.  In both cases, the actual economic
efficiency effects of creating the property rights depend upon the workings of
the market for both the final product and the rights. There has been
considerable work on market failures for pollution permits, and this paper
extends the analysis to ITQs.  It is shown that the difference between
pollution permits and ITQs can change the type and occurrence of failure in
the market for the final product, but it does not affect the potential for
failure in the market for permits.

This paper discusses the economic aspects of determining a conversion
factor program that will maintain the total allowable catch in an individual

made to convert the landed weight to a green weight.  The conversion factor is
a serious problem in the New Zealand ITQ program.

A bioeconomic model of a fishery is developed that accounts for the
discarding of a lower valued component of the catch due to high grading, low
grading, and hold capacity.  Hold capacity is based on a model of a fishing
trip.  Highgrading is a problem only when the value of the higher priced
species exceeds the costs of harvesting it and the costs of discarding the
lower priced species.

Fisheries Regulation Programs.""  Marine Resource Economics ,

ITQ management programs can provide incentives to discard low valued
fish so that individual quota can be used for relatively more valuable fish. 
Such ""highgrading"" can also occur where there are other constraints on
harvest, such as hold capacity.  This paper compares and contrasts the exact
conditions under which highgrading will occur with ITQ and other harvest
constraints.  Considering all costs, highgrading can be efficient with
physical constraints but it is an unfortunate artifact of ITQs.  Whether or
not highgrading will occur depends upon the price differential between high
and low valued fish, the cost of sorting and discarding, and the cost of re-
harvest.  Policies for correcting or reducing ITQ highgrading should it occur
are described.

biased towards issues which are discussed most frequently in public forum,
often in ways that ignore simple economic principles.

Gimbel (ed.) Limiting Access to Marine Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on
Conservation , Center for Marine Conservation and the World Wildlife
Fund, Washington, D.C.
The paper will compare and contrast open access with controlled access
modes of fisheries regulation.  While some of the differences can be quite
subtle, for purposes of discussion they can be distinguished as follows.  The
former controls the activities of participants but does not explicitly control
their number.  The latter controls the number of participants or in some cases
the number of fishing units (i.e., boats, traps, or the amount of tonnage).  A
controlled access program may also control the activities of the restricted
number of participants.
It will be demonstrated that regulations used under open access are
often biologically ineffective in the long run due to technological innovation
and industry growth.  In addition, they can lead to economic inefficiencies in
harvest and processing.  A prime motivation for the development of controlled
access regulations was to correct for these two potential problems.  Depending
upon how they are formulated and upon the nature of the particular fishery to
be managed, controlled access regulations can be successful in this regard.
One way of comparing open access and controlled access management is to
see how each of them can address important issues of different fisheries. 
Controlling discards, bycatch, mortality in nursery areas, and maintaining
product quality and industry viability are just a few of the many problems
that must be addressed.  It is frequently the case that potential management
tools are dismissed because of a perceived weakness in addressing one of these
issues.  Since there is no perfect management tool, the important question in
comparing open access to controlled access management techniques is not which
one has weaknesses, but which one can be adopted, implemented and enforced
such that the stated management objectives can be most nearly achieved.

Anderson, Robert J., Jr. and Thomas D. Crocker (1971).  ""Air Pollution26and Residential Property Values."" Urban Studies , 8:171-180.
The fundamental hypothesis of the relationship between air pollution
dosages and real estate values for measuring the benefits of air pollution
control is that a portion of air pollution damage to artifacts and organisms
is capitalised negatively into the value of land and immobile durable
improvements thereon causing land rents to vary inversely with air pollutant
dosages.  This paper (1) examines the theoretical underpinnings of cross-
section studies of demand in which characteristics of goods are used as
explanatory variables, and (2) to apply that rationale to the study of air
pollution and residential property values.

Inverse demand functions are often useful econometric representations of

inverse demands that aid their interpretation and facilitate calculations
related to them.  We introduce the notion of scale elasticity that is shown to
play for inverse demands much the same role that income elasticity does for
direct demands.  It is used in a decomposition of Antonelli effects that is
analogous to the Slutsky equation for direct demands.

presented to support why NRE is gaining support.

Shrimp, the most valuable fishery resource of the south Atlantic coast
of the United States, contributed about 40 percent of the $27 million ex-
vessel value of all fishery landings in the area in 1966.  Three species of
shallow water penaeid shrimps are of greatest commercial importance: white27shrimp, Penaeus  setiferus ; brown shrimp, P. aztecus ; and pink shrimp, P.
duorarum .  The shrimp fishery is reviewed for trends in yield for the area as
a unit, by State, and by species, for the ten year period 1958-67.  A trend
toward steady decline in total shrimp landings is indicated.  During studies
on the white shrimp along the south Atlantic coast of the United states in
1931-1935, data were obtained on the brown shrimp; the sea bob, Xiphopeneus
kroyeri ; and Trachypeneus  constrictus .  Observations were also made on the
pink shrimp from operations of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries R/V Oregon
of northeast Florida near Cape Kennedy in 1965-67.  This report presents size
distribution, ovary development, and sex ratios of the several species of
shrimp, and includes limited information on spawning season.

This dissertation develops a multiobjective bioeconomic policy model of

analyze the implications (trade-offs) of resource allocation alternatives on
the level of three policy objectives: present value of net revenue,
production, and female spawning biomass.  Pareto optimal solutions for the
three policy objectives were generated under various specifications of the
model by means of generating techniques.  Three policy instruments were
considered: harvest quotas, fleet/processing capacity limits, and allocation
between the shore-based and offshore fisheries.  Results were presented in the
form of trade-off curves.

Success in the California Salmon Sportfishery: Evidence and
Management Implications.""  Marine Resource Economics , 5(2):125-
138.
This paper examines effort responsiveness to success in the California
salmon partyboat sport fishery.  The management process in this important
fishery involves setting target harvest levels for both commercial and
sportfishing groups and then using closed seasons, restricted gear, and
possession limits to dampen effective effort.  An important component of the
management process involves forecasting sportfishing effort and its effect on28catch to advance-plan management actions.  For want of better information,
simple proportionality rules-of-thumb are used currently and this paper
examines the plausibility of these.  Some simple models forecasting aggregate
angler participation and aggregate partyboat catch on a weekly basis are
estimated across several different ports.  Our findings suggest that anglers
are responsive to recent success in several ports (elasticities up to +.5) and
that angler participation affects catch with an elasticity exceeding unity. 
These results indicate that the simple rules of thumb currently in use could
be in substantial error.

This paper builds a model of fishery regulation with incidental catch or
bycatch and simulates it with parameters from the Nova Scotia cod and haddock
fisheries.  When comparing optimal coordinated taxation with the independent
taxation of each fishery separately, we find that independent taxation
requires significantly higher tax rates to control the stock externality
associated with competitive behavior.  Quotas are found to be suboptimal
relative to any form of taxation, because of their inflexibility in the
presence of uncertainty, and because they can control bycatch only indirectly.

Biologists have determined that the red snapper resource in the Glf of31Mexico is depleted for several reasons, including the application of too much
fishing effort by commercial and recreational red snapper fishermen and the
incidental bycatch and discard of juvenile red snapper by the shrimp trawl
fleet.  The ensuing debate about how best to restore the red snapper
population to desirable levels has involved numerous technological, political
and economic facets.  Among them are: technological interaction in which
shrimping gear inadvertently harvests other species, including juvenile red
snapper; management interaction between fishery management plans; competition
between commercial and recreational fishermen and among fishermen with
different gear types within each group; and economic trade-offs over time,
among various harvesting groups and between different groups of consumers.  It
constitutes a management problem that is controversial, challenging, and, as
yet, unresolved.

Quota-Induced Discarding in Heterogenous Fisheries.""  Draft
manuscript, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management .
Individual quota (IQ) programs are a promising and increasingly common
means of regulating fisheries.  This paper examines how profit maximizing
fishers respond to different types of IQ programs in fisheries where many
types of fish are harvested simultaneously.  The paper first specifies a joint
production function for the fishery.  Using this technology, the responses of
profit maximizing fishers to different IQ programs are analyzed.  This
analysis shows first that the most common types of individual quota program
can induce discarding, and second that of all possible individual quota
programs, only those that regulate the value of harvest never induce
discarding.  Since discarded fish have a high mortality rate,  value-based 
individual quota programs are superior to their more conventional counterparts
in that they waste fewer fish.  These results are driven by the fact that the
fishing technology examined here does not satisfy a  free-disposal 
assumption.  Since this free disposal assumption is ubiquitous in production
theory, and not obviously true, the framework developed herein is useful for
analyzing a broad class of problems involving joint production.

This study applies the travel cost model using survey data collected by the

estimated empirically using a Maximum Likelihood approach, which recognizes
that the travel cost data are of a discrete nature and subject to systematic

the sport-boat fishing services provided by the Corpus Christi Bays are
significant, and that improvements in habitat and water quality could result
in significant gains in economic value.

Methods and Reduction of Capacity.   Draft Report, Working Group 3,
Technical Working Group on the Management of Fishing Capacity, FAO, La
Jolla CA, April 15-18, 5 pp.
Incentive adjusting control methods include individual quotas, taxes,
group fishing rights, and individual effort quotas because they tend to
improve or tighten the connection between those persons making fishery
management and capacity decisions and the persons bearing the full
consequences of those decisions.  If the consequences are entirely borne by
the decision maker, there are no external effects of the decision and the
decision-maker tends to act in the social interest when serving his self-
interest.  It is important to realize that the different incentive adjusting
control methods have widely different implications in terms of wealth
generation and, in particular, its distribution.  These methods potentially
could lead to reductions in fishing capacity if properly applied in certain
fisheries.

describe possible solutions for the Russian-Norwegian joint management of the

as well as cooperative compensated solutions to the problem, are introduced
and discussed.  The cooperative solutions are compared to one another in terms
of the parties' preferences, threats and maximum points, and further set into
a context of compensated exchange.  Based on the cooperative and compensated
solutions discussed, a negotiation framework is established in which four
distinct stages of decision making can be identified.  Finally, the different
solutions are discussed in the setting of Norway and Russia's current
political and economic environment.  The so called Salukvadze solution,
compensated or not, can be seen to be an appropriate solution to the fisheries
problem.  The compensation must be paid over time to Russia.

In this paper, we focus on the impact of product mix decisions made by

fishing quota allocated to each vessel.  It is shown that an optimal fisheries
management scheme cannot be determined without considering the market prices
and the production attributes of the fish products.  Also, contrary to the
results of fisheries economic models to now, it is not necessarily optimal to
give as high a quota as possible to each vessel, and thus to operate as few
vessels as possible.

This paper agues that in most ocean fisheries the data requirements for
the calculation of optimal tax rates, catch quotas, etc. greatly exceed the
capacity of any resource manager.  It follows that management systems based on
such approaches are of little practical use.  On the other hand, there appear
to exist institutional arrangements that allow the resource manager to take
advantage of the market mechanism to solve the management problem.  This paper
addresses this issue.  It attempts to specify institutional arrangements of
the fisheries and management procedures that permit optimal management with
minimal use of extraneous information.  This is referred to in the paper as
minimum information management schemes (MIMS).

Arnason, Ragnar (1993).  ""The Icelandic Individual Transferable Quota
System: A Descriptive Account.""  Marine Resource Economics ,
8(3):201-218.
This paper provides a brief description of the evolution and current
structure of the individual quota system (IQ) in the Icelandic fisheries. 
This particular fisheries management system was introduced at different times
in different fisheries-in the herring fisheries in 1976, in the capelin
fishery in 1980, and the demersal fisheries in 1984.  Since 1990 all Icelandic
fisheries have been subject to a uniform system of individual transferable
quotas (ITQs).
The paper discusses the social and economic impetus for the initial
adoption of the ITQ fisheries system in the various fisheries, sketches its
subsequent development and describes the key elements of the current system. 
Assessments of the economic impact of the ITQ system are presented in the las
part of the paper.  Although a definitive study of this impact is not
available, the various indicators presented generally indicate an improvement,
sometimes substantial one, in the economic efficiency of the fisheries in
question.
Arnason, Ragnar (1994).  ""On Catch Discarding in Fisheries.""  Marine
Resource Economics , 9(3):189-207.
This paper examines the economics of catch discarding in fisheries.  To
study this issue a simple dynamic fisheries model is constructed.  On the
basis of this model, it is demonstrated that in a differentiated fishery
discarding of catch may be socially optimal.  The paper goes on to show that
individual firms in a free access, competitive fishery employ the socially
optimal discarding rule.  In contrast, the individual transferable quota (ITQ)
fisheries management regime tends to generate an excessive incentive for
discarding catch.  The problem, however, does not appear to derive from the
ITQ system as such.  Rather, it seems to depend on the imperfect application
of the system to real fisheries.  The concept of a discarding function is
defined and it is shown that at least within the framework of the model41employed the discarding function for an ITQ fishery dominates the one for free
access, competitive fisheries.  Numerical examples are provided.  Finally,
possible remedies of the discarding problem are briefly discussed.

In, Bio-Economic Modelling in the EU , Concerted Action Coordination of
Research in Fishery Economics, Working Document Nr: 7,(AIR CT94 1489),
Workshop, Edinburgh, October: 92-99.
The theory on discarding of catch at sea demonstrates that an unmodified
application of the ITQ fisheries management system induces an incentive for
discarding of fish in excess of what is socially optimal.  In fact, the basic
result is that there is no simple relationship between discards and the two
management systems of ITQ fisheries management and an unmanaged fishery. 
Discards may either increase or decrease as a consequence of the introduction
of an ITQ management system depending upon the fishing gear selectivity and
fishing ground choice made by the participants.  Although the tendency to
discard harvested fish may increase under an ITQ fisheries management system,
the impact of the same system on harvesting selectivity may actually lead to a
reduction in the total volume of discards.
Arnason, Ragnar (1998).   Ocean Fisheries Management: Implications for the
Volume and Quality of Fish Supply.   Fisheries Research , 34: 215-225.
This paper considers the probable impact of improved fisheries
management on the volume and quality of fish supply.  It is shown that the
transition from a rent dissipation equilibrium (where most open access
fisheries find themselves) to an economically efficient equilibrium may just
as easily entail a decrease as an increase in the volume of harvest.  Indeed,
given the current level of the world s fish stocks, it appears unlikely that
the current trend toward economically efficient fisheries management regimes
will result in a significant increase in the worldwide supply of marine
catches.  Therefore, it seems that a sustained increase in the future volume
of fish supply must continue to come from fish farming.  The movement toward
more efficient fisheries management regimes is, on the other hand, likely to
substantially enhance the quality of landed catch.  Due to fish stock and
fishing capital dynamics, however, this effect is likely to be stronger in the
short rather than the long run.
Arnason, Ragnar (1998).   Notes on the Impact of ITQs in Iceland.   Technical
Working Group on the Management of Fishing Capacity, FAO, La Jolla CA,
April 15-18, 5 pp.
The individual vessel quota system in Iceland seems to have yielded
considerable economic benefits.  New investment in fishing capital has been
reduced and the fishing fleet has contracted.  In some fisheries, the number
of operating units has dropped significantly.  Fishing effort has also been
significantly reduced.  Finally, estimates of the actual economic rents
generated by the system as well as analysis of quota values strongly indicate
that very substantial economic benefits are already being generated by this
management system.

considerable differences from current port use patterns.  Social benefits
derived from their application demonstrate the value of this technique.

The rule for an optimal investment policy requires equating at any
moment of time, the instantaneous marginal productivity of capital to C(t)
which is determined by depreciation conditions and the future course of the
rate of interest and is independent of the profit function.  This rule is
myopic in that the future movements of the profit function play no role in the
determination of the current stock of capital and therefore of current
investment.  The rate of interest in question is the instantaneous or short-
term rate, not as usually assumed a long-term rate and the depreciation
(replacement) component is not purely technological but in general depends on
future interest rates.

Units of natural resources to be called ""mines"" are assumed distributed
over an unexplored territory according to a Poisson process in space.  At any
moment, total reserves and unexplored land are given.  Society can determine
the rate of consumption and the rate of exploration.  Reserves are drawn down
by consumption and increased by discoveries made during exploration; the
amount of unexplored land is decreased by exploration.  At any moment, the
payoff of society is a concave function of consumption less a linear function
of exploration with future payoffs discounted.  Optimal policies are
considered and, in particular, it is shown for a large amount of unexplored
land the shadow prices of reserves and of unexplored land move in random
cycles but show only a slight upward tread, thereby casting some light on the
failure of mineral prices to rise at the market rate of interest.

that population growth should be stabilized by attacking some of the roots of

cost to implement a world program of action, and the challenges that

This paper examines the economic implications of currently proposed
marketable pollution right (MPR) systems for attaining ambient air quality
standards in local airsheds.  We show that (1) the magnitude of local control
costs for one MPR system must be less than or equal to that under the current
pollution control system and (2) if this MPR system significantly reduces
local costs of control, it must significantly increase local ambient
degradation and, with high probability, the extent of long range sulfate
deposition.  A simulation for a region of the Ohio River Basin indicates that
the cost saving and increased ambient degradation and sulfate deposition in
the Northeast and Canada should be large.

the tremendous cost advantages to be achieved by moving from a policy based on

points out, however, neither of the major permit designs treated in the
literature are optimal from all points of view.  This has triggered a search
for alternative permit designs, that while they may not minimize compliance
costs have sufficient other virtues as to make them attractive on other
grounds.  The purpose of this paper is to examine, within the context of an
empirical mathematical programming model, the air quality emission, and cost
consequences of two classes of the permit designs that can be implemented in
the absence of information on control costs.  This case study involves
particulate control in St. Louis.

""Measuring and Decomposing Productivity Change: Stochastic
Distance Function Estimation vs. DEA.""  Draft Report, Department45of Economics, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, August, 26 pp.
Linear programming techniques have been widely used to compute Malmquist
indices of productivity change as ratios of fitted distances from a convex
hull frontier.  These indices are then decomposed into technical and
efficiency change.  However, since this approach is non-stochastic, inference
is problematic.  Further, although the Malmquist index is valid for any degree
of returns to scale, productivity change is measured relative to a constant
returns to scale frontier.  As an alternative, we develop and estimate a
flexible stochastic distance frontier which allows for statistical inference
and imposes no restrictions on returns to scale.  We indicate how productivity
change can be decomposed into technical and efficiency change and specify an
appropriate generalized method of moments strategy.  Finally, comparisons are
drawn between the stochastic and non-stochastic methods using a panel of
electric utilities.

A baseline assessment for 35 economically and ecologically important
Florida Keys reef fish stocks is provided using a systems approach that
integrates sampling, statistics, and mathematical modeling.  Quantitative
fishery independent data from reef fish visual surveys conducted by SCUBA
divers from 1979-1995 were used to develop estimates of population abundance,
assemblage composition, and stock structures in relation to key physical and
habitat factors.  Exploitation effects were assessed using a new length-based
algorithm that calculates total mortality rates from estimates of  average
length of fish in the exploitable phase of the stock.   These estimates were
highly correlated for two statistically independent headboat catches.  We
developed a reef fish equilibrium exploitation simulation (REEFS) model and
used estimates of fishing mortality to assess yield per recruit relative to
fishing intensity and gear selectivity, and spawning potential ratio (SPR)
relative to U.S. federal  overfishing  standards.  Our analysis show that 13
of 16 groupers (Epinephilinae), 7 of 13 snappers (Lutjanidae), one wrasse
(Labridae), and 2 of 5 grunts (Haemulidae) are below the 30% SPR overfishing
minimum.  Some stocks appear to have been chronically overfished since the
late 1970's.  The Florida Keys reef fish fishery exhibits classic  serial
overfishing  in which the largest, most desirable and vulnerable species are
depleted by fishing.  Rapid growth of the barracuda population (Sphyraenidae)
during the same period suggests that fishing has contributed to substantial
changes in community structure and dynamics.

A mechanism exists whereby global greenhouse warming could, by
intensifying the alongshore wind stress on the ocean surface, lead to
acceleration of coastal upwelling.  Evidence from several different regions
suggest that the major coastal upwelling systems of the world have been
growing in upwelling intensity as greenhouse gases have accumulated in the
earth's atmosphere.  Thus the cool foggy summer conditions that typify the
coastlands of northern California and other similar upwelling region might,
under global warming, become even more pronounced.  Effects of enhanced
upwelling on the marine ecosystem are uncertain but potential dramatic.

Simulation Model of the Walleye Pollock Fishery in the Gulf of

Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service.
A bioeconomic simulation model was used to evaluate the effect of
alternative harvesting strategies on the biological status and profit
potential of the walleye pollock ( Theragra chalcogramma ) fishery in the Gulf
of Alaska.  The simulation model, which projects future stock condition given
likely catch and recruitment scenarios, integrates an age structured
population dynamics submodel with an economic submodel.  The biological
submodel describes temporal partitioning of the annual harvest between a
January through April roe fishery that targets on prespawning aggregations in
Shelikof Strait and the fishery that occurs during the rest of the year in the
central and western gulf.  The economic submodel includes cost and revenue
functions for the harvesting sector.  Results of the simulations indicate
that: 1) the timing of the harvest can be an important factor affecting stock
condition when quotas are high and 2) a reduction in the quota for 1987, to
protect the strong 1984 year class that was first available to the fishery in
1987, would reduce the discounted present value of profits from the fishery in
the 20 year simulation.

The paper models multiproduct supply response in agriculture and tests
key assumptions traditionally maintained in supply response studies.  The

the restricted profit function are imposed during estimation.  The hypothesis
that maintains the existence of output price and quantity indexes that satisfy49the adding-up property is rejected.  The existence of individual production

considerably understated.

This paper proposes to measure the harvesting capacity of the major
elements of the U.S. Pacific fishing fleet.  The type of capacity used is
called  peak-to-peak  capacity and reflects the percentage of potential
harvest that the industry would be willing to produce if there were not
constraints on resource availability or restrictions on resource harvesting. 
Because the definition of capacity is extremely crucial to this analysis and
its application, the underlying assumptions is crucial to the methodology
chosen to calculate capacity.  Ten Pacific coast fisheries have been examined
for 15 to 17 years.  These fisheries account for 86 percent of the dollar
volume and 72 percent of the total weight volume of landings in the Pacific
area.

The system is estimated for each industry with annual time series data from

accounted for a significant proportion of that slow down.

Trawl Fisheries; A Nonparametric Frontier Production Analysis.""
Draft report, Norwegian College of Fishery Science, University of
Tromso, Breivika,  9037 Tromso, Norway.
This paper focuses on efficiency in trawler vessels operating in the
Norwegian cod fisheries.  In the last 10 to 15 years, the trawler fleet and
the corresponding land-based industry have gone through considerable
structural changes.  The trawler fleet is composed into two segments; those
delivering fresh/chilled cod to the land-based industry and those vessels
producing the catch on board into fillets and thus bypassing the land-based
industry.  The increasing number of factory trawlers have resulted in regional
and political conflicts.  There has been a lack of economic analysis comparing
the productivity in factory trawlers contra fresh fish trawlers and land-based
production.  Productivity measurement based on nonparametric frontiers have
become a standard procedure for analyzing the performance of production units. 
The efficiency analysis used by us is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
where miro data from the trawler fleet is used to define a nonparametric best
practice frontier which shows the total factor productivity of each unit
relative to that frontier in the period 1985 to 1996.  The results shows the
structural efficiency of the trawler fleet with respect to size, processing
technology, quota restrictions and variations in vessel specific productivity.

Shrimp fishing began in Alaska over 50 years ago.  Recently the annual
domestic catch has been as high as 40 million pounds.  Japanese and Soviet
Union fishermen operating in Alaskan waters have caught as much as 70 million
pounds annually in recent years.  The five commercially important shrimp of
Alaska belong to the family Pandalidae; the most important is the pink shrimp,
Pandalus  borealis .  The complicated life histories of these shrimp are all
similar.  The shrimp develop first as males and after several years transform
to females, which they remain for the rest of their lives.  United States
fishermen use otter trawls, beam trawls, and pots, and deliver their catch to
ports in Alaska; foreign fishermen use larger otter trawls and process the
catch at sea.  The Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Bureau of
Commercial Fisheries are studying the shrimp.  They are sampling the
commercial catch, trying to improve the product, and conducting exploratory
fishing and biological research.

In 1988, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife began sampling and
monitoring the development of a new fishery for Pacific hagfish, and black
hagfish.  Hagfish landings by Oregon trap vessels have ranged from 11,695 kg
in 1988 to 340,774 kg in 1992.  Whole frozen fish were shipped to South Korea52for the ""eel skin"" leather market.  From 1988 through 1989, I sampled 924
Pacific hagfish and 897 black hagfish from commercial and research catches. 
Mean length of fish sampled from commercial landings was 39.6 cm for Pacific
hagfish and 34.5 cm for black hagfish.  Weight-length relationships (W=Alb)
were calculated for males and females of both species.  Fifty percent maturity
for male and female Pacific hagfish was 35 cm and 38 cm, respectively. 
Examination of gonads for both species indicated that spawning either occurs
throughout the year or the spawning period is protracted.  Mature females of
both species had from one to three distinct sizes of eggs, but they usually
carried only one group of eggs over 5 mm in length.  Mature Pacific hagfish
females averages 28 eggs over 5 mm in length, and black hagfish females
averaged 14 eggs over 5 mm in length.  Hermaphroditism was found in 0.2% of
the Pacific hagfish examined.

Almost Additive Preferences.""  Econometrica , 32(1-2):1-38.
This paper addresses the gap between the theory of consumer demand and
empirical demand research.  The theory of consumer demand is reformulated
along the lines set out in the articles by Frisch and Houthakker.  However,
their specialization to direct (or indirect) additivity of the utility
function may be considered too severe a restriction for the level of
aggregation of the data that are available in this case.  A modification of
direct additivity has therefore been introduced to take account of specific
interaction between the different types of consumers' expenditure.  The theory
and the resulting restrictions on the elasticities to be estimated are
discussed in section 2.  The data used for the estimation are a set of time
series describing total consumer expenditure in the Netherlands on fourteen
types of commodities or services and the corresponding price indices covering
the periods 1921-1939 and 1948-1958.

Application of an Inverse Demand System.""  European Economic
Review, 33:1509-1525.
Inverse demand systems explain price variations as functions of quantity
variations.  They have properties analogous to those of regular demand
systems.  There are very few examples of their empirical application.  In part
this is due to lack of data for which price is the decision variable and the
quantity given.  The case of fish landed at Belgian sea ports appears to suit
an inverse demand system well.  A Rotterdam variant of such a system is
estimated.  Allais interaction intensities have been derived and show a
reasonable pattern.

This chapter presents a proposal for a feasible tax-subsidy program.  A
practical and effective procedure for the protection of the environment is
suggested; the use of pollution charges to implement a predetermined set of
standards for environmental quality.  Some degree of arbitrariness in the
design of such standards is inevitable.  And in agreeing to such a procedure,
one gives up any attempt to reach any true social optimum.  Yet this proposal,
that is essentially a ""satisficing"" approach to the problem, can be shown to
offer some significant optimality properties.  Aside from the administrative
savings made possible by avoidance of central direction and direct controls,
we will show that the proposed procedures, properly designed and implemented,
can lead to the attainment of the selected standards and that in appropriate
circumstances, they can do so at something approximating minimum cost to
society.
Baumol, William J. and Wallace E. Oates (1975).  ""Stochastic Influences,
Direct Controls, and Taxes.""  Chapter 11 in  The Theory of
Environmental Policy .  Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.
Chapter 11 suggests that direct controls can be a useful supplement to a
system of charges for the continuing maintenance of acceptable environmental
conditions.  Their usefulness arises from the inflexibility of tax rates and
the comparative ease with which certain types of direct controls can be
instituted, policed, and removed.  The problem is that the state of
environmental quality at any time depends not only on the level of emissions
but on such essentially stochastic influences as wind velocity and rainfall,
that determine the rapidity of the dispersion of accumulated pollutants.  As a
result, we can expect occasional environmental crises that can be predicted
only a short time before they occur.  It would be too costly to society to
keep tax rates sufficiently high to prevent such emergencies at all times. 
Instead, it may be less expensive in such cases to make temporary use of
direct controls, despite their static inefficiency.  The chapter ends with the
description of a nonlinear programming model that illustrates the logic of the
design of an optimal mixed program.
Baumol, William J. and Wallace E. Oates (1975).  ""Taxes vs. Subsidies: A
Partial Analysis.""  Chapter 12 in  The Theory of Environmental
Policy.  Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.
Chapter 12 examines the use of subsidies as a reward for decreased
damage by those who generate the externalities.  First, we describe formally55the conditions under which fees and subsidies are equivalent.  Here we find
that the equivalent subsidy is a very strange sort of construct, one that we
are unlikely to encounter in practice.  Next, we show that subsidies in the
more conventional sense are a poor substitute for taxes.  Although the two may
be equally effective in reducing emissions by the individual firm, the subsidy
encourages the entry of new firms into the industry, whereas taxes encourage
their exit.  As a result, we can expect that a subsidy program will be less
effective in discouraging pollution than a tax program with similar marginal
rates.  In particular, we find that, under pure competition, if emissions are
uniquely determined by the industry's output level and rise monotonically with
output, a subsidy program will necessarily backfire.  Although the subsidy
will produce a reduction in the emissions of each firm, it will lead to an
entry of new firms that more than offsets it.  Total emissions under a subsidy
program will in this case always be greater than they would have been if no
cleanup subsidy program had ever been instituted.

There has been a commercial trawl fishery for shrimp in South Carolina's
sounds and bays for over thirty years, and the controversy surrounding this
practice is a longstanding one.  Major issues of concern are related to
potential ecological effects and impacts upon commercial and recreational
fisheries.  The prevailing management philosophy has been to permit shrimp
trawling at appropriate times in offshore waters, sounds, and bays while
prohibiting it in the tidal creeks and rivers that serve as nursery areas. 
This summary presents the historical background of the sound and bay policy,
describes the rationale for allowing inside trawling, provides information on
the issues, specifies recommendations, and lists alternatives for the
management of the sound and bay resources.

Between National and Foreign Fisheries with a Fluctuating Fish
Resource."" Marine Resource Economics , 1(2):137-154.
The problem of allocating the rights to exploit fish resources between
domestic and foreign fleets is posed in the context of a fluctuating fish
stock.  Such fluctuations are ubiquitous and are driven by the recruitment
variation.  A number of biological models are proposed to describe the
dynamics of the resource.  It is supposed that harvesting by both foreign and
domestic fleets is permitted, and the possibilities for allocation between
these two fleets are examined.  The optimal allocation policy is derived for a
number of different economic and biological situations.  In many situations it
will be optimal for there to be a mix of foreign and domestic fishing on the
resource.  This result implies that licensing and joint venture agreements
between coastal states and distant water fishing nations may be desirable from
the point of view of the coastal state, even in the long term.

As harvesting effort and yield are increased, animal populations that
are being harvested for sustained yield will take longer to recover from
environmentally imposed disturbances.  One consequence is that the coefficient
of variation (the relative variance) of the yield increases as the point of
maximum sustained yield (MSY) is approached.  When overexploitation has
resulted in a population smaller than that for MSY, high effort produces a low
average yield with high variance.  These observations accord with observed
trends in several fish and whaling industries.  We expect these effects to be
more pronounced for a harvesting strategy based on constant quotas than for
one based on constant effort.  Although developed in a MSY context, the
conclusions also apply if the aim is to maximize the present value of
(discounted) net economic revenue.

Cropping of Self-Reproducible Natural Resources.""  Econometrica ,

Models of the behavior of populations of self-reproducible natural
resources in an economic framework have rarely anticipated the consequences of
different forms of production functions.  This paper investigates sufficient
conditions for extinction in a very general model as well as a model having a
specific production function.  In the second section additional considerations
relating to extinction are deduced as well as the existence of a watershed
level of population.  These conclusions are exemplified using data from one
particular population of red deer.

The present study used an underwater observation technique that

Property Resources: An Empirical Study of the U.S. Northern
Lobster Fishery.""  Journal of Political Economy , 80(1):148-158.
This paper demonstrates the effect of technological externalities on the
production of northern lobsters, a common property resource. An increase in
effort (that is, size of the industry) of 100,000 traps fished will depress
landings per trap for the individual firm by 2.4 pounds.  Therefore, the
northern lobster industry produces so as to equate average revenue to long run
average cost.  Approximately one-half of the present fishing effort would be
needed to achieve economic efficiency or marginal cost pricing.  The goal of
allocative efficiency should be weighted against the strategy to provide
somewhat greater employment, especially in rural areas where labor opportunity
cost is relatively low.

As fish farming has emerged to compete with a preexisting common
property fishery sector, rent dissipation and consequently welfare losses may
be reduced.  Fish farming increases the increment to supply resulting in lower
prices and reduces the quantity supplied by the commons (not necessarily
true).  Welfare gains accrue only when marginal cost is rising faster than
average cost, which is the usual case in the wild fisheries.  Using data from
the Louisiana pond and wild crawfishing industries for 1978, fish farming of
crawfish reduced potential welfare losses by 76 percent.  See AJAE article

Bell, Frederick (1989).  ""Main Quarry Hypothesis and Salmon Angling."" 
Marine Resource Economics , 6(1):71-82.
This article explores the main quarry hypothesis, which is a variant of
the general fishing success hypothesis.  It is argued that for some
recreational fisheries it may be more important that the angler catch his
target or main quarry than the quantitative number of fish caught in
influencing the number of fishing days and the overall quality of the
recreational experience.  A theoretical function is specified to explain the
length of the fishing trip to Ireland by anglers that have designated salmon
as their main quarry.  The empirical estimation of this function indicates
that the length of the fishing trip is positively related to travel cost, but
inversely related on-site cost per day.  Ceteris paribus, the length of the
salmon trip to Ireland, is increased by nearly 23% when the angler gets his
main quarry, stressing the importance of the quality of the catch rather than
quantitative number of fish caught.  This finding calls into question the
traditional fishing success variables such as catch per day for many
recreational fisheries.

Models: Alternative Structures of Travel Demand Models.""  National

A multidimensional choice situation can be represented by a simultaneous
or recursive model structure.  The paper described assumptions of each
structure and argued that, in the absence of restrictive assumptions about
behavior, travel decisions are more realistically represented by a
simultaneous model structure.  It is simple to estimate a recursive structure,
for each choice model contains fewer alternatives and variables.  The primary
issues in the selection of a strategy for calibration are (a) whether
calibrating the simultaneous model is feasible and (b) what effect the use of
a recursive rather than a simultaneous model structure has on the estimated
parameters.

The principle purpose of this model is to aid in the evaluation and
design of regulations that affect the fishery.  It differs from most previous
models with a similar purpose in three ways. (1) Daily fishing costs are
assumed to vary among fishermen. (2) Daily fishing effort is determined
endogenously rather than being treated as a control variable. (3) Entry into
the fishery is determined endogenously up to a cap imposed by the regulatory
agency.  The model explains the adverse reaction to a proposed attempt to
increase the value of the fishery by delaying the opening date.  The model is
used to predict the economic consequences of four feasible sets of
regulations.

Borrowing from the theory of optimal resource extraction, we develop the
mechanism guiding efficient commodity storage and marketing over producing
regions through the crop year.  Optimal storage occurs at producing areas, and
time in storage varies directly with distance to market.  Prices grow with
interest rates in locations where storage is efficient but more slowly
elsewhere, which explains why market prices (i.e. prices at the market) grow
more slowly than interest rates.  The model is empirically supported by
examining storage in the Corn Belt, rates of price growth at various points,
and quarterly grain marketings.

the Long Run.""  The Bell Journal of Economics , 10(2):447-62.
Critics of current and historical trends in timber production contend
that private owners cut their woods more quickly than optimal, while public
managers cut their forests more slowly than optimal.  Using the douglas fir
industry, this paper shows that private entrepreneurs holding rational
expectations with respect to future prices have historically been discounting
the future at a real rate of 5 percent - a much lower rate than that available
for other private investments - and, therefore, that these owners have not cut62their forests prematurely.  In the case of public management, calculated
shadow losses incurred by holding old timber are so great that an appeal to
nontimber use values is not sufficient to reconcile management practices. 
Finally, predictions for the long-term price trends for timber indicate a
slowdown in the rate of price increase.

This paper reconsiders necessary conditions for extinction of an animal
population.  Containing many of the models previously developed in the
literature, the general model proposed here suggests that (i) conditions for
extinction depend exclusively on the relation of a minimum viable population
size to the minimum population size at which any exploitation is profitable,
(ii) necessary conditions for extinction need not be characterized in terms of
returns-to-scale parameters or growth rates as other authors have contended,
and (iii) possible short run shutdown may save a population from extinction if
the fish population at the time of shutdown is large enough to sustain the
species.

differ from those characterized by rate of interest equals rate of change in
growth plus rate of change in prices.  Measures to reach an optimum with
externalities other than direct controls are found to be critically mediated
by the costs of harvesting.

when the fish stock is much lower than its steady state value if the boat
fleet is sufficiently small.  This paper contrasts myopic and rational
expectations within a general dynamic model of an open access fishery.

In a static competitive analysis the entire burden of an excise tax on a
good in fixed supply falls on the supplier.  Imposing a tax does not affect
the price paid by consumers and the price received by suppliers falls by the
amount of the tax.  One is tempted to conjecture that this result extends to
the case of costlessly extracted depletable r  Although he amount of such a
resource that is supplied in any single period can change in response to
variation in the intertemporal price structure, the total amount available for
all time is fixed.  Thus it is plausible that the effects of an excise tax
imposed once and forever might be the same in the static model.  This
conjecture turns out to be true.

Avenue, Cambridge, MA, April, 36 pp.
In this paper, we develop measures of economic capacity output and
economic capacity utilization for firms producing multiple outputs and having
one or more quasi-fixed inputs.  Although we produce an impossibility theorem
showing that based only on the assumption of cost minimization, the concept of
capacity output is undefined whenever the number of outputs (I) exceeds the
number of fixed inputs (M), we are able to provide alternative constructive
procedures for defining capacity output whenever I<=M.  We also propose a
number of additional primal and dual measures of utilization of the variable
and fixed inputs.  Including a multi-fixed input analog to Tobin s q.  We
relate these alternative utilization measures to one another, and show that
unambiguous inequality relationships among them (relative to unity) can
typically be specified a priori  only under rather restrictive assumptions.  We
show that unless restrictive assumptions are made, the multi-fixed input
analogs to Tobin s q have little informational content regarding incentives
for net investment of any specific fixed input.  Finally, we demonstrate the
usefulness of the alternative utilization measures by showing how they can be
incorporated to adjust traditional measures of multi-factor productivity
growth for variations in short run utilization.

This paper presents evidence on the possibilities for substitution

technological possibilities for substitution between energy and nonenergy
inputs are present, but to a somewhat limited extent.  Specifically, we find
that energy demand is price responsive, energy and labor are slightly
substitutable, and energy and capital are complementary.  We also find that
our data do not support the value added specification typically used in
studies of production and investment behavior.

inefficiency in terms of firm specific variables.  A multi step estimation
procedure is used instead of single step maximum likelihood estimation.  Model
selection tests are used to choose the best model.  Privately owned utilities
are most efficient; self-governing water districts are the least efficient. 
Municipal governments operate the most and least efficient utilities.

In 1983, the European Community agreed on a management and conservation
regime for fisheries resources by adopting the EEC regulation no 170/83.  This
has been one of the main text of the Common Fisheries Policy for ten years. 
It gave a major place to Total Allowable Catch (TAC) by stock or by group of
stock.
After ten years of implementation of this regime, the European
Commission admitted that it had some large insufficiencies (ECC, 1991).  The
EEC regulation no 3760/92, which has replaced the EEC regulation no 170/83
since the end of 1992, put some stress on other management instruments, e.g.
licenses, and on the possibility of using TACs by fishery or over several
years.  Nevertheless, the annual TAC by stock appears to still have a future
and it seems interesting to look at data in the debate on their performance.

the Fishing Industry.""  Coastal Management , 19:417-437.
Global meteorological conditions may be changing, and sea levels over
the next centuries could rise at rates usually measured over millennia.  As a
result, fish habitats, fishery yields, and the industry's shoreside
infrastructure could change dramatically.  This article summarizes predicted
sea-level changes; forecasts possible short- and long-term effects on fish
habitats, valued estuarine and coastal species, and fishing industry sectors;
and recommends specific actions to maintain a viable fishing industry. 
Lacking applicable research results, most effects are extrapolated from
professional opinions and related research on other coastal industries or
features.  Emphasis is on the United States' Atlantic Coast.
Predicted impacts should change over time.  Some short-term changes
could be beneficial as new habitats are created for estuarine species, but the
long-term implications on most sectors, especially shoreside industries, are
more negative than positive.  Potential impacts should inspire harvesting and
processing sectors to participate in remedial planning, where assistance is
available from coastal managers.
Recommendations address deficiencies in natural resource management
strategies, development policies, short- and long-term waterfront plans,

Species extinction irreversibly narrows the reservoir of potential

calls for avoidance of extinction unless the social costs are unacceptably
large.  The level at which costs become excessive is a matter of
intergenerational distribution.  The paper also explores important linkages

A number of potential sources of bias in the contingent valuation and

summed together, these potential problems are sufficient to justify
considerable skepticism about the accuracy of resulting value estimates.  In

Though preliminary, the results of this experiment indicate that substantial

""Contingent Valuation of Environmental Assets: Comparisons with a
Simulated Market.""  Draft report.
The evidence to support the view that people confronting a contingent
valuation mechanism do not have well developed beliefs about how they would
behave in real markets for environmental assets comes primarily from an
experiment involving Wisconsin goose hunting permits.  These permits were
evaluated using several CV mechanism and a travel cost model.  They were also
evaluated in a ""simulated market"" where permit holders were offered real money
not to hunt.  The results show that contingent values could easily be in error
by 50 percent or more.  After describing the experiment and its results, the
remainder of the paper explores the reasons for these errors with particular
emphasis on the artificiality of CV mechanisms.  Several conclusions emerge,
including one particularly interesting hypothesis:  Our results and those of
some other studies seem to show that CV mechanisms tend to underestimate
willingness to pay and overvalue environmental assets when the criterion is
willingness to accept compensation.
Bjorndal, Trond (1988).  ""The Optimal Management of North Sea Herring."" 
Journal of Environmental Economics and Management , 15:9-29.
A discrete time dynamic bioeconomic model for a fish resource is
developed.  The objective is maximization of discounted net revenues subject
to changes in stock size.  The model of population dynamics is described by a
delay-difference equation.  Natural growth and recruitment are related to
stock size, with recruitment taking place with a time lag.  Conditions
characterizing the optimal stock level are derived.  The model is applied to
North Sea herring.  Estimates of the optimal stock level are given, and
optimal trajectories derived.  Due to the schooling behavior of herring, it is
shown that open access amy cause stock extinction.

Bjorndal, Trond (1989).  ""Production in a Schooling Fishery: The Case of
the North Sea Herring Fishery."" Land Economics , 65(1):49-56.
This paper undertakes an empirical analysis of the harvest function for
the North Sea herring fishery.  The empirical results indicate that there is a
rising marginal product to the variable input in the fishery.  Fishery
regulations that were in force, including total quotas and closed seasons, are
found to be either ineffective or causing boats to operate inefficiently.70Bjorndal, Trond and Jon M. Conrad (1987).  ""Capital Dynamics in the
North Sea Herring Fishery.""  Marine Resource Economics , 4: 63-74.
A discrete time model is formulated to model decisions of boats to enter
or exit the North Sea herring fishery.  A lagged model is specified to reflect
adjustment time to changes in profits.  The empirical results indicate that
fleet adjustment in this fishery primarily depends on current period profits
and that the opportunity cost may depend on returns in the alternative fishery
(mackerel).  Lagged variables reflecting vessel construction time accounted
for a small increase in the statistical fit.  The hypothesis that entry in
response to positive profits is more elastic than exit due to negative profits
was not supported by the results.
The harvesting industry's capital investment model was relatively
simplistic reflecting the limited data set available to the authors.  The
annual data covered a relatively short period of time and probably little
cross sectional data existed for this fishery.  These limitations restrict the
available degrees of freedom necessary to construct and estimated more
sophisticated models.

Since passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of
1977, U.S. fishery managers have concerned themselves with achieving  optimum
social yield .  To effect this mandate, fishery managers have focused on
direct effort controls without determining how fishermen, commercial or
recreational, may prefer the fishery be regulated.  Using contingent valuation
methods, economists may determine if preferences exist for some types of
regulations.  This paper uses contingent, or discrete, choice questions from a
1991 mail survey of Northeastern recreational Western Atlantic bluefin tuna
fishermen o demonstrate that fishermen have preferences for catch limit
regulations.

Discarded trawl fish can be processed into fish meal, fish solubles,
fish oil, pet food, and various forms of seafood.  This study evaluates the
nature of the markets potentially available for trawl fish and estimates
potential volumes that could be marketed through these channels.  Price
flexibilities were estimated for each market to evaluate impact of increased
supplies on price.  Based on these estimated relationships, current market
conditions and the availability of trawl fish in the Western Gulf of Mexico,
potential volumes that could move through each market were determined.  For
example, the total catch of trawl fish by shrimpers of 368 million pounds
could move through the reduction market with only a negligible effect on72price.  The lack of viable marketing facilities along the Texas Coast for many
product forms is an important limitation on flow of trawl fish into market
channels.

The impact of alternative management schemes on the shrimp fishery of

simulation techniques (GBFSM).  The fishery's biological and economic
functions are modeled including intraseasonal shrimp growth rates, differences
in demand for shrimp by size, and a heterogenous fishing fleet.  Using
consumer and producer surplus techniques, new fishing regulations appear
socially optimal compared to the baseline.  A rent maximization scheme
increases social surplus to its highest level.  However, applying such a
scheme to one part of the total Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery is not
recommended.

Uncertainty in the context of demand for fisheries products suggests two
quite distinct issues.  The first is the uncertainty that resource managers
face in predicting demand; the second is the uncertainty that faces consumers
of fishery products.  This paper argues that the first either is of little
importance relative to other prediction problems of fishery managers or
provides no new problems of analysis.  However, the second issue relates to
the demand for quality, a topic receiving much attention in the recent
economic literature and one that has particular significance for the demand
for seafood.  When producers in a competitive industry have control over
quality but consumers cannot perceive quality upon inspection, welfare gains
can be made from imposing minimum quality standards.  In addition, publicly
supplied and accurate information about quality would have returns to both
parties when consumers, uncertain about the health risks related to fish
consumption, exhibit risk averse behavior.

exists, e.g., water related recreational activities when the nonmarket good to

This paper addresses the theoretical and applied difficulties involved
in estimating compensated and equivalent variation for large price changes in
natural resource facilities.  Unambiguous measures of welfare changes cannot
be calculated when a resource is eliminated (price changes from zero to
infinity).  Also, contingent valuation measures are preferred to the direct
approach of travel cost demand analysis for estimating consumer surplus due to
the difficulties of using Willig's bounds in this case of zero demand for
access to the natural resource (trips).

The household production function is an intuitively appealing way to
model man's interaction with nature.  This paper models the interaction
between the household's behavior and publicly provided inputs into wildlife
recreation.  The paper shows how to compute benefits, assuming that the
household production function is known.  The household production function
approach collapses to the simple travel cost approach when households are
unable to substitute their own inputs for publicly provided inputs.  In
addition, the paper demonstrates the conditions under which the parameters of
cost an preference functions can be identified.  The conditions for
identification are quite restrictive when several choices are endogenous.

Measurement in the Household Production Framework.""  American

A new conceptual basis for welfare measurement of nonmarket goods is
provided.  The paper shows that the traditionally conceived Marshallian
demands are not uniquely defined.  In contrast, the utility constant marginal
value functions that are dependent only on preferences and not technology do
exist and have the usual normative interpretation.  Regardless of joint
production or nonconstant returns to scale, the area behind the marginal value
and marginal cost curves measure economic surplus.  Changes in this area
measure welfare effects associated with changes in the individual's economic
environment.  Finally, the paper shows that equivalent measures of welfare
change can often be obtained in the market for goods that serve as inputs into
the household production process without assuming that the technology is
known.

In the absence of complete control in a regulated industry, effective
management requires prediction of firms' behavioral responses to public
policy.  This paper develops a discrete choice model of supply response under
uncertainty and applies it to fishery choice problems of New England fishing
firms.  While fishermen demonstrate a bias towards remaining within the same
fishery, sufficient incentives, in terms of changes in expected returns and
risk, are shown to elicit response.  Due to extreme uncertainty concerning
population dynamics of fish stocks, a satisficing approach to management,
facilitated by this type of modeling, may be more appropriate than bioeconomic
optimization.

In this paper, the existing recreational demand analysis is improved by
developing a defensible model of recreation behavior conditional on labor
market decisions.  The primary purpose is to explore the implications of
realistic time and income constraints for modeling the behavior of
recreationalists.  These constraints are developed from the labor supply
literature which is also used to identify the appropriate econometric
estimation techniques.  The proposed approach incorporates a defensible method
for treating the value of time as well as addressing the sample selection bias
arising from sampling only participants.  Exact measures of recreational
benefits are developed by estimating demand functions consistent with utility
maximization.  In the final section, recreational benefits estimated from this
approach are compared with those generated by conventional models and
estimation practices.

""Time and the Recreational Demand Model.""  American Journal of76Agricultural Economics , 69(2):293-302.
In this paper, a theoretically consistent approach to including time
costs in recreational demand models is developed.  The demand model is
conditional on the recreationist's labor market situation.  For individuals at
corner solutions in the labor market, utility maximization is subject to two
constraints, leading to a demand function with travel costs and travel time as
independent variables.  With interior solutions in the labor market, time is
valued at the wage rate and combined with travel costs to produce one ""full
cost"" variable.  In an illustration, welfare measures based on the new model
are estimated for a sample of sportfishermen.

Survey of Models of Recreation Demand in a Multiple Site
Framework."" Draft report, Department of Agricultural Economics,
University of Maryland, College Park, MD.
A topic that has received particular attention in the recreational
demand modeling literature is the modeling of the demand for systems of
alternative sites, as compared with the more traditional single site modeling
approaches.  The multiple site models are frequently complex, diverging from
simple intuitive extensions of the single site model.  They are also diverse,
and this together with their complexity makes assessment and comparison of
models and results difficult.  While problems in the theory and application of
single site models remain, most practitioners understand these models and
their inherent problems and can apply them with a cautious confidence.  In
contrast, multiple site models are difficult to sort out, to interpret, and to
estimate.
In this paper, we first explore the reasons why multiple site models
have been developed and outline a number of the approaches which have been
used.  We then asses these models with a specific criteria in mind: how well
do they account for the specific nature of benefit changes in a multiple site
framework?  Using a common data set, we demonstrate a few of the estimation
techniques.

enrichment, toxic substances, and the decline of submerged aquatic vegetation. 
Although the beneficiaries are ultimately human, criteria for judging the
Bay's water quality have been primarily biological and physical.  This paper
addresses the question of the human values from the Bay.  How do people use
the Bay and how much are they willing to pay for the changes in water quality
that improve their use:  With a variety of methods and data sources, we
estimate the annual aggregate willingness to pay for a moderate improvement in
the Chesapeake Bay's water quality to be in the range of $10 to $100 million
in 1984 dollars.

Bosch, Darrell J. and Leonard A. Shabman (1989).   The Decline of Private
Sector Oyster Culture in Virginia: Causes and Remedial Policies.  
Marine Resource Economics , 6(3):227-243.
Oyster production from private grounds in Virginia has declined
significantly since 1960.  Restoring industry production requires a better
understanding of the reasons for this decline.  Currently, state fishery
managers and the popular press attribute the decline to the oyster disease
Haplosporidium  nelsoni  (MSX).  In fact, private planters themselves consider
MSX disease as the primary constraint on the future profitability of private
oyster culture.  This study analyzes potential causes of the decline using a
simulation model of oyster production with data from the 1960's, 1970's, and
1980's.  The analysis suggests that rising seed prices driven by economic and
productivity changes are more important than MSX in reducing the economic 
incentives to private planting.  Therefore, reducing oyster seed prices is an
effective policy strategy.  However, education of planters will also be needed
to assure a better understanding of the profit potential in oyster planting.

This paper examines two sets of hypotheses concerning the existence and
the cause of the long run inter-species price relationships in the Japanese
tuna market.  A shock variable is introduced into the system to determine the
degree of influence on the price relationships as well as the magnitude of the
power in explaining the variation in prices of tuna species.  Although in most
cases the coefficient estimates of the shock variable are statistically
significant, overall, the variable does not have significant explanatory power
in both bivariate and multivariate regressions.  We also find that the degree
of substitutability between bigeye and albacore is substantially lower than
the degree of substitutability between bigeye and albacore is substantially
lower than the degree of substitutability between bigeye and yellowfin and,

The conditional logit decision model is applied to the choice of
occupation by individual workers to test the implications of the theory of
human capital.  The empirical results support the human capital hypothesis
that workers choose occupations to maximize the discounted present value of
potential lifetime work time.  Allowing for imperfect capital markets by
including training costs relative to wealth and for unemployment by including
the discounted present value of expected earnings foregone due to unemployment
also yielded results consistent with a priori expectations.

polyphemus , Fishery and Resource in the United States.""  Marine
Fisheries Review , 49(3):57-61.
The American horseshoe crab is a focus for increasing economic and
scientific importance because its blood has important biomedical applications
and because the crab is used as bait in several fisheries.  In addition,
horseshoe crab eggs may be critical as a source of food for migratory79shorebird populations of the Delaware Bay region, and adult crabs are
predators of valuable clam resources.  Fishing related mortality in the United
States is estimated minimally at 350,000 crabs per year, mostly in the middle
Atlantic and southern New England states.  Bait operations apparently kill
(10-20 times the number of animals killed for bleeding to obtain the valuable
Limulus  amoebocyte lysate (LAL).  Based on National Marine Fisheries Service
groundfish trawl surveys, the population of horseshoe crabs on the middle
Atlantic continental shelf has remailed relatively constant since 1975 at 2.3
to 4.1 million individuals.  Exploitation may not be trivial, particularly if
local populations are targeted during the spawning period; we suggest several
foci for further investigations on this species.  There is no evidence that
current levels of harvesting are depleting the resource.  It is important,
however, to continue monitoring activity, particularly if levels of
exploitation increase.

in the North Atlantic Swordfish Fishery.""  Thesis, Department of
Food and Resource Economics, University of Florida, Gainesville,
FL, December.
In an attempt to reduce fishing mortality of the North Atlantic
swordfish fishery, domestic and international management agencies have
cooperated in a multilateral effort to establish quotas and minimum size
requirements in the fishery.  These restrictions can have significant economic
consequences on the participants in the fishery.  A four equation partial
equilibrium model of swordfish and tuna supply and demand is developed to
derive a general equilibrium swordfish demand function.  The empirical model
predicts behavior consistent with general equilibrium theory.

This paper begins with a historic overview of the swordfish fishery. 
The problems that have developed within the fishery become evident as we
discuss production trends.  The evolution of the original swordfish management
plan is traced to today's impending regulations.  Since the U.S. is the
primary importer of swordfish the role of imports is analyzed within a simple
economic trade model.  We will conclude with a summary of the impacts of the
regulations that affect domestic producers and consumers.  However, because of
the number of countries involved in the North Atlantic swordfish fishery, the
regulations have international implications as well.  Two Versions.

This chapter is intended to provide a background in economic concepts
specifically focused on the multiple use management of public forestlands by
extending the models introduced in Chapter 2.  The managers of these lands
must, in addition to considering the value of timber harvests, the primary
focus of Chapter 2, consider the various nonmarket amenity services such as
recreation, water flow and wildlife which are influenced by alterations in the
standing stocks of timber.  We discuss research results on the relation of
such multiple use management to single purpose timber management.  The
presentation is motivated by a number of issues of current concern: the
withdrawal of lands from timber management, the specialization or
diversification of land use, the level and stability of timber supply, and the
wisdom of certain accepted rule-of-thumb principles of public forestland
management related to the age and level of harvests.
Boxall, Peter C. (1995).   The Economic Value of Lottery-Rationed Recreational
Hunting.   Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics , 43(1):119-131.
Lottery-rationed permit systems are used to allocate hunting
opportunities where demand for permits exceeds the ability of the animal
populations to sustain hunting harvest levels.  Attempts to estimate the
values of lottery-rationed hunting use a zonal travel cost model where
applications per capita formed the dependent variable and expected travel
costs represent the price variable.  This paper reexamines this analysis using
a discrete choice travel cost model which incorporates the expectation of
receiving a permit.  This model is developed for lottery-rationed antelope
hunting in Alberta.  Choice in the lottery-rationed hunting context involves
selecting one site from a set defined through management regulations.  The
discrete choice travel cost model is proposed as superior to the early models
because it better represents this behavioral process.

of a Commercial Fishery.""  Draft report, Department of
Agricultural Economics, University of California, Davis.
This paper addresses fishery management from a within season point of
view; the movement of fishermen with multiple locational choices.  A model is
developed that explains fishing fleet allocation among the alternative
locations given uncertainty with respect to the catch rates in each location
and competition between the fishermen for the allowed catch.  The model
focuses upon the decision rules under which rational risk-neutral agents would
choose to operate when competing with other agents in a stochastic
environment.

Fishery.""  Draft report.
This paper examines the dissipation of rents that occurs in an open
access fishery within a season.  The behavioral model that is developed below
explicitly assumes that agents seek to maximize their expected profits over a
fishing season.  To do so, agents must account for both the variable costs and81the fixed costs.  The fixed costs in this model are essentially the costs of
entering the fishery.  These may be in terms of foregone opportunity costs or
in terms of direct costs of entering such as the costs of fuel and crew time
to move from the home port to the fishery.
Boyce, John R. (1988).  ""An Econometric Model of Entry and Exit in a
Fishery.""  Draft report, Department of Economics, University of
Alaska, Fairbanks, Fairbanks, Alaska, 99775.
A set of simple behavioral relationships are postulated that may be used
to determine the number of agents who will actively participate in the fishery
at any moment in time and the spatial distribution of the agents over a
fishery with multiple locations.  These relationships are then used to develop
a switching regression model that predicts the participation rates and
distribution for the British Columbia Salmon fishery from the observed data of
catch and effort.  A crowding externality, a stock externality, and costs
increasing from most to least efficient are incorporated into the model.   The
results of the model estimation are not provided.

The North Pacific groundfish fishery is modeled to determine the impact
of ITQ and penalty box management schemes on firm bycatch levels.  It is the
heterogeneity of the fishery and the fact that decisions are made in the
political process that drives the selection of institutions over common
property resources.  I should come as no surprise then that when the industry
was faced with a real choice of how to deal with the problem, that it chose to
implement a system that most closely resembled the status quo.
Boyce, John R. (1992).  ""Individual Transferable Quotas and Production
Externalities in a Fishery.""  Natural Resource Modeling , 6(4):385-
408.
This paper determines the conditions under which an individual
transferable quota (ITQ) system will cause fishermen to engage in cost
decreasing, rather than cost increasing, competition.  If there are production
externalities (e.g., congestion or stock externalities) present, the market
price of a quota will not be fully reflected in these externalities.  Thus,
fishermen will not fully internalize the externalities in their effort
decisions.  Even if there are no production externalities, an individual
fisherman imposes costs on others under open access by removing a fish that
was available to all fishermen.  An ITQ system allows the individual who
values that fish most to obtain the right to harvest the fish, so each
fisherman must internalize the full social cost.  Thus, an ITQ system is
capable of solving the common property externality but not the production
externalities in a fishery.
Boyce, John R. (1993).  ""Using Participation Data to Estimate Fishing
Costs for Commercial Salmon Fisheries in Alaska.""  Presented at
the International Conference on Fisheries Economics, Os, Norway,
May 26-28.
Using the number of fishermen participating in a particular opening as a
proxy for net revenues, estimates of fishing costs can be estimated using
total revenues.  The results are used to estimate producer surplus for each of
nine fisheries for the 1990 season.82Boyce, John R. (1993).  ""Using Participation Data to Estimate Fishing
Costs for Commercial Salmon Fisheries in Alaska.""  Marine Resource
Economics , 8(4):367-394.
This paper estimates the fishing costs and the returns to fishing from
nine commercial salmon fleets in Alaska.  The econometric model uses a two-
stage least squares estimation procedure to estimate the effect of congestion
and heterogeneity on the returns to fishermen.  The hypotheses that fishermen
are homogenous and that there is no congestion externality present in the
fisheries are strongly rejected.  The data indicates that fishermen are quite
heterogeneous in fishing skill levels.  This difference accounts for the
overall estimates of positive net returns to the common property fisheries. 
Estimates of the net returns to the fisheries suggest that the returns to
different gear types vary largely.  The set net fleets are found to have the
highest return as a percentage of total revenues.
Boyce, John R. (1995).   Optimal Capital Accumulation in a Fishery: A
Nonlinear Irreversible Investment Model.   Journal of Environmental
Economics and Management , 28:324-339.
A nonlinear two state variable, two control variable model of a fishery
with irreversible investment and harvest capacity constraints is examined. 
The model relaxes assumptions of linearity in investment costs and variable
harvest profits in an earlier model by Clark, Clarke, and Munro (1979).  In
both the linear and nonlinear models, the optimal capital accumulation paths 
in new fisheries is characterized by a period in which the physical capital
stock level exceeds its long run sustainable equilibrium.  However, unlike the
linear model, periods of positive net (but declining gross)investment are
optimal in the nonlinear model.  This accords with observed capital
accumulation paths from a number of fisheries.  The paper also finds different
effects in optimal harvest policy depending upon whether the linearity appears
in the variable profits function or the investment cost function.
Boyce, John R. (1996).  ""An Economic Analysis of the Fisheries Bycatch
Problem.""  Journal of Environmental Economics and Management ,
31(3):314-336.
Bycatch is the incidental take of a species that has value to some other
group.  This paper compares open access and individual transferable quota
equilibria to the equilibrium in which the joint value of the fisheries is
maximized.  The open access induced problems can be corrected by an individual
transferable quota system only if both the target species and the bycatch
species have tradable quotas, and only if the bycatch species does not have
existence value.  There exists a range of the bycatch-to-target species
harvest levels for which the total harvest of each will be exactly taken by a
given technology, even under open access.  However, there may not even exist a
unique open access equilibrium if bycatch is allocated by  rule of capture.  
Prohibitions on the sale of bycatch reduce the bycatch level, but they also
reduce social welfare.

""The Alaska Salmon Enhancement Program: A Cost/Benefit Analysis."" 
Presented at the International Conference on Fisheries Economics,
Os, Norway, May 26-28.
In May 1991, the Alaska Senate's Special Committee on Domestic and
International Commercial Fisheries initiated the first review of the state's
salmon enhancement program since its inception 20 years ago.  As part of this
review, a cost/benefit analysis of the State's enhancement program for83sockeye, chinook, coho, chum, and pink salmon was performed with cooperation
from the Fisheries Research Enhancement Division of the Alaska Department of
Fish and Game.  Results indicate that for all species, except chinook, net
benefits will decrease as the enhancement program is expanded, and increase if
the enhancement program is scaled back.  However, in only the case of pink
salmon was the estimated effect judged to be significant enough to warrant the
recommendation that the state would benefit from the reduction of the hatchery
program.  Under this scenario there would, however, be significant regional
differences.  For all scenarios, it is recommended that the State of Alaska
reduce its funding of the enhancement program and allow the fishers, through
the private nonprofit hatcheries, to fund the programs that they consider to
be profitable.

In May 1991, the Alaska Senate's Special Committee on Domestic and

salmon enhancement program since its inception 20 years ago.  As part of this
review, a cost/benefit analysis of the State's enhancement program for salmon
was performed with cooperation from the Fisheries Research Enhancement
Division of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.  The main results are that
the additional producer's surplus generated by the pink and sockeye hatchery
programs are estimated to be less than the costs of running these programs. 
Eliminating the entire pink or sockeye salmon programs is estimated to
increase net benefits by about 8% and 6%, respectively.  A 15% increase in
either program is estimated to result in a reduction in net benefits and a 15%
decrease in either program is estimated to result in a slight increase in net
benefits.  Estimates of the confidence intervals for net benefits suggest that
the gains from the elimination of either the pink program or the sockeye
program are statistically different from zero.  However, changes of plus or
minus 15% of current hatchery production are found not to statistically affect
net benefits.

years of the New Zealand experience.  We use Copes' (1986) paper as a catalyst
to compare his assessment of potential problems of individual quotas with the
actual operation of individual quotas in New Zealand.  The brief New Zealand
ITQ experience demonstrates that the economic rationale behind individual
transferable quotas is sound.  We discuss the problems and positive effects of
New Zealand's experience.  Individual transferable quotas should not be viewed
as a panacea, but simple as another fisheries management option.

Three commonly used techniques of asking contingent valuation questions
are compared: iterative bidding, payment cards, and dichotomous choice.  The
results reveal that no single contingent valuation technique is neutral in the
elicitation of hicksian surplus and each technique has its strengths and
weaknesses.  The iterative bidding estimates contain a starting point bias,84while the payment card and dichotomous choice estimates were influenced by the
interviewers soliciting the contingent values.  Finally, the analysis of
dichotomous choice responses involves unresolved issues that warrant further
investigation.  On the other hand, dichotomous choice is the easiest technique
to administer in a survey setting.

to the likelihood of diversified production.  The resource importer gains from

entire transition path.  Thus the basic  gains from trade  presumption is
substantially undermined by open access resources.  Tariffs imposed by the
resource importing country always benefit the resource exporter and may be
Pareto-improving.

Marine Fisheries Service, December, 11 pp.
A critique of The Corps of Engineers  economic analysis which is built
on several critical assumptions.  The Corps assumes that through better
fisheries management many currently depleted fish stocks will be rebuilt to
former robust level.  The Corps further assumes that the fishery management
(including those stocks that are not under the aegis of the Magnuson Act) will
be effective in preventing overcapitalization.  That is, potential economic
rents created by the stabilization of Oregon Inlet will not be dissipated by
increases in the number, average size, or efficiency of the current fishing
fleet.  In practice this probably means that the fisheries will be managed
using some sort of individual transferable fishing quotas.  Implicit in the
Corps  analysis is also the assumption that the general condition of fisheries
habitat will not continue to deteriorate and that the presence of the jetties
will not harm fisheries through disruption of larval transport through the
inlet.  The author questions the usefulness of the Corps  analysis.

become institutionalized to such a degree that managers in effect sanction
waste by counting discards against the catch quotas of directed fisheries that
wish to take and use the very species discarded.  It questions whether this
policy of allocating catch levels first to a fishery that must discard this
take is in keeping with a stated national policy of wise use of marine
resources.

Eventual development of marine minerals potential in the Asian Pacific
would likely draw on the technology, skills, and experience of the emerging
international seabed mining industry.  As a result of strategic behavior by
its firms, this small numbers industrial  strategic group  has created a level
of capacity for seabed mining exploration and research and development (R&D)
that far exceeds the near term level of activity expected in seabed mining. 
The paper reports on the nature of preproduction industry structure (or
 protostructure ) in seabed mining and draws implications for efforts to
develop the resource potential of Asian Pacific marine minerals.  Seabed
minerals exploration and R&D services might be offered to Asian Pacific
nations at bargain prices (below unit cost) by firms with first starter
advantages in the emerging industry.  However, cautionary notes are included
about constraints on the economic potential of the regions s deep sea minerals
such as manganese nodules, polymetallic sulfides, and cobalt crusts.

Quota: Lessons From the Wreckfish Fishery.""  Draft report,
Department of Economics, University of North Carolina at
Greensboro, November, 22 pp.
This paper explores the reasons for the observed behavior of the
wreckfish catch and the market for quota and annual leases of quota. 
Understanding these observations may have important implications for the
management of ITQ fisheries; it may change our expectations of how much of the
actual resource rents can actually be recovered under realistic management
conditions and it may point to changes in management that allow for the
greater recovery of otherwise lost rents.

Series: ECO960201, Working Papers in Economics, Center for Applied

University of North Carolina at Greensboro, February, 29 pp.
Recent experience with individual transferable quotas (ITQs) as a tool
of fisheries management has begun to shed empirical light on the well
established theory of ITQs.  The Atlantic wreckfish ( Polyprion  americanus ) is
currently under ITQ management by the U.S. federal government, and in may ways
the theoretical predictions about ITQs have been borne out by developments in
this fishery.  But an unexpected puzzle has arisen; not all owners of
wreckfish quotas are using their fishing rights, even though the market price89of quota has increased over time.  We evaluate two possible explanations of
this phenomenon, first that fishermen in this small fishery are withholding
their ITQs to improve a depleted stock, and second that a combination of fixed
costs and opportunities in other fisheries has created an excess ex post
supply of ITQs.  We argue that the first explanation is inconsistent with the
observed facts of the wreckfish fishery, but that the second appears to match
those facts fairly well.  We conclude with a discussion of the implications of
our results for ITQ management.

Complete demand systems have always been estimated under the assumption
that either prices or quantities were exogenous.  In this paper, we introduce
some explicit price adjustment process and test the assumption of exogeneity
of prices.  Comparing the model with endogenous prices to the model with
exogenous prices will reveal that the assumption of the exogeneity of prices
is not a very dramatic one as both estimated models are very similar in many
experiments with American and Canadian data. Applying a system wide Wu-Hausman
test and a likelihood ratio test, will always lead us to reject the exogeneity
of prices in three commodity models, while at the more disaggregated level,
prices may often be considered as exogenous.

if Louisiana offshore fishing grounds are more heavily utilized because of the

is a brute force analysis of some extremely large data sets.

Four types of paying passenger recreational fisheries operate on the
Florida Gulf Coast and in the Florida Keys.  An estimated 604 captains were
active in the fisheries in 1977.  Target species differ with fishery type and
region of operation.  Declining catches (catch per unit effort) and increased
operating costs, particularly for fuel, are major problems of these fisheries
according to the captains.  In those fisheries where previous information is
available the number of operations has increased in the past fifteen years in
the Florida Keys, decreased greatly on the west Florida coast and decreased
slightly on the northwest Florida coast.

The land-water interface of coastal marshes may influence the production
of estuarine dependent fisheries more than the area of these marshes.  To test
this hypothesis, we created a spatial model to explore the dynamic
relationship between land-water interface and degree of land loss in
disintegrating coastal marshes of Louisiana's Barataria, Terrebonne, and
Timbalier basins.  Calibrating our model with Landsat Thematic Mapper
satellite imagery, we found a parabolic relationship between land-water
interface and marsh disintegration.  Aggregated simulation data suggested that
the land-water interface in the study area will soon reach its maximum and
then decline.  We found a statistically significant positive linear
relationship between brown shrimp catch and total interface length over the
past 28 years.  This relationship suggests that shrimp yields will decline
when interface declines, possibly beginning about 1995.91Brown, Ausbon, Jr., James A. Bohnsack, and Douglas Harper (1989).

This paper derives an optimum program for managing a common property
natural resource whose rate of growth of the resource stock depends on the
resource stock level and the current rate of extraction.  If the resource
stock initially is sufficiently small it is shown that it will be socially
optimal to have a period of no extraction.  When extraction begins, it and the
variable factor increase faster than the resource stock is increasing. 
Changes reflecting the imputed marginal social value of the resource are a
decreasing function of the level of the stock.  These results differ from
Smith (1968) recent static treatment of the same problem and are discussed
below.

Consumers do not always face constant unit prices for the goods and

examples where implicit prices are nonlinear.  We show that nonlinear budget
constraints fundamentally alter the demand relationship.  The exogenous
parameter (marginal price) consumers face in the linear case is replaced by an
exogenous price function (the price gradient) in the nonlinear case.  Two ways
are developed in Section II to solve the demand functional: a parametric
approach and a system equation approach.

A simple model is developed for determining the socially optimum price
to charge locationally differentiated irrigation districts for both surface
and groundwater supplies.  Steady state conditions are assumed for groundwater
conditions and water demand functions.  A divergence between social and
private optimums arises from the existence of unadjudicated rights to
groundwater supplies.  The social optimum can be achieved by an appropriately
conceived taxing policy.  Water prices, tax rates, and optimum lift levels are
estimated for seven irrigation districts, members of a master water agency.

The hedonic travel cost method is a technique that reveals how much

regressing travel costs on the bundles of characteristics associated with each
of several potential destination sites.  The demand for site characteristics
on site quality is then revealed by comparing the site selection of users
facing different attribute prices.  The technique is applied to value
steelhead fish density in Washington State streams.

Recently the situation in Argentina was one of declining fishery
production in the domestic arena, with only 25-30 percent of the resource
being exploited.  Lack of technology and working capital led to abandonment of
substantial parts of the fleet, and flight from the industry.  A new
government administration took an aggressive stance and attempted to reduce
manipulation and tampering in the management process, and reduce union control
over the industry.  To encourage investment and attract new technology a quota
scheme was established.
Allocations of quota share were made between local fishing groups and
foreign subsidiaries as well, via an auction.  Supplemental conservation
measures such as gear restrictions and seasonal closures were implemented to
address biological concerns.  The preliminary results indicated that the new
system was dramatically better than the prior system, and was highly
successful in attracting capital and technology.
Two models are currently being evaluated by a variety of fishing groups. 
One essentially creates a co-op system that includes a negotiated fee
structure and submitted performance criteria.  The other model uses a tonnage
allocation system, under which an auction is held for the industry to purchase
shares of quota.

To determine the closing and opening dates of the shrimping season in

seven bay systems; with 6.1 m trawls in the deeper portions of three bay
systems and in five passes leading from the bays to the Gulf; and with 12.2 m
trawls in Gulf of Mexico waters off the central coast.  The purpose of the
closed season was to protect small shrimp from fishing until they reached a
larger, more valuable size and to minimize waste caused by discarding smaller
sizes during the harvest.  Based on biological sampling in April the closed
season dates were set for 25 May to 14 July 1982.  Additional sampling through
July verified that these dates were appropriate to accomplish the purpose of
the closure.

discards averaged 40% by number and 26% by weight in 1973 and 37% by number
and 22% by weight in 1974 samples.  Most of the shrimp discarding took place
in June, July, and August.  Using the average yearly landings of brown shrimp
for the last nine years, an estimated 14.9 million kilograms (32.8 million
pounds) of small shrimp and 116 million kilograms (255 million pounds) of
associated organisms were discarded per year.  Comparisons of catch rates for
various types of trawls is also discussed.

During June-December 1973 and 1974, 81 samples were collected with a
13.7 m. wide otter trawls from aboard a research vessel in the same areas that
commercial shrimp vessels were fishing on the Texas brown shrimp grounds. 
This study was done to estimate the amounts and kinds of organisms captured
during shrimping operations and to estimate the amounts discarded and times
when most discarding occurred.  Economic waste of small shrimp discarding
could be minimized if legal size limitations were removed and waters were
closed to shrimping when small, less preferred shrimp predominated.  Under
present conditions, no monetary incentive to market other invertebrates and
fish species captured on the brown shrimp grounds appears to exist because of
their relatively low volume and small size.

equal for pelagic and demersal species and was generally concentrated
nearshore.  There appeared to be a substantial change in the fishery since the
late 1940's and early 1950's, possibly reflecting socioeconomic trends and
population dynamics of the fish species.

leaders and bureaucratic administrators, charges with doing something about
these problems, appear to favor direct controls.  Our purpose in this paper is
to present a positive theory of externality control that explains the observed
frequency of direct regulation as opposed to penalty taxes or charges.  In the
public choice theory of policy, the interests of those who are subjected to
the control instruments must be taken into account as well as the interests of
those affected by the external diseconomies.  As we develop this theory of
policy we shall also emphasize an elementary efficiency basis for preferring
taxes and charges which heretofore has been neglected by economists.

A review of the concepts of overcapitalization in world and U.S.

nontechnical audience.  With too many fishermen vying for too few fish, the
U.S. commercial fishing industry is becoming as overcapitalized as the
resource is over fished.  A management regime that addresses open access
concerns appears warranted, as does an overall reduction in fishing capacity. 
Nevertheless, significant questions remain.  In particular, how and in what
form should access be addressed?  In what sector(s) and by what means ought
reductions in capital invested in the commercial fishing industry occur?  And,
what is the role of the Federal government in such proceedings?  These
questions and several others await careful evaluation by scientists,
conservationists, industry experts, and lawmakers alike, while the fates of
fishermen and the fish they depend upon hang in the balance.

Canada, September.
After Canada extended its 200 mile limit in 1977, the inshore small98dragger fleet in the Scotia-Fundy Region grew dramatically in fishing power. 
By 1989, fleet capacity had exceeded that required to harvest the resource at
F0.1 by four times.  This increase in capacity was paralleled by an expansion
of regulations to contain effort and protect the stocks.  In 1989, management
plan negotiations broke down and a Task Force was struck to define a new
management system.  Among other initiatives, it was recommended that
Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQ) be implemented.  During 1990, the ITQ
program was designed through joint DFO/industry committees and launched in
1991.  Since then, dragger fleet capacity has been reduced, with concentration
of quota in fewer boats.  There have also been changes in price structure,
seasonal pattern of landing and fishermen's attitudes.  However, it is not
obvious that at sea fishing practices have changed.  As well, due to recent
resource declines, effort has been displaced to non-ITQ fisheries.  This paper
documents the background to the ITQ program, its implementation and what has
been achieved to date.

Resources.""  Journal of Environmental Economics and Management ,
3:289-311.
A resource constraint alters the profit maximizing decision rule for a
natural resource producer.  Such a producer also responds differently to
common policy instruments.  For a zero rate of discount, it is shown that a
franchise (lump sum), severance (ad valorem or unit), or profit tax result,
respectively, is increased, unchanged, and unchanged output.  These results
are generalized to the case when the rate of discount is nonzero and tax rates
vary over time.  A tax subsidy scheme for guaranteeing the equality of optimal
social and private rates of depletion is presented for a case where these
rates diverge.

Application to Ground Water.""  Management Science , 11(1):80-93.
This paper is concerned with optimal allocation over time of a single
resource that is either fixed in supply or only partially renewable at a point
in time.  Some resources that fall in this category are mineral deposits,
ground water, petroleum, wildlife, and fish.  A functional equation is
obtained from a dynamic programming formulation of the problem.  This
functional equation is used to derive approximate decision rules for resource
use as a function of current supply.  The results are applied to ground water
storage control and tested empirically by comparison with a decision rule
obtained by detailed numerical methods.

Resources Research , 3(1):45-56.
A relatively simple economic model for allocation of groundwater in time
is developed.  The economic consequences of altering various parameters in the
model are examined with respect to the effect on equilibrium stocks and rate
of use.  The concept of a conditional decision rule for stochastic groundwater
recharge and the properties of the implied equilibrium are discussed.  In its99simplest form, the derived decision rule is to equate marginal net output with
respect to rate of use to capitalized marginal net output with respect to
water stocks.

Methods are given for statistically estimating the empirical measures needed
to apply the model, and an application is made to water oriented outdoor

Five eastern Florida navigational channels were surveyed on a quarterly
basis from November 1981 through August 1982.  The purpose of the surveys was
to provide estimates of loggerhead turtle abundance for each channel over all
seasons of the year.  Standard methods for estimating loggerhead turtle
abundance from trawl samples were developed, and the probability of capture in
a 30 m by 1,483 m substation was estimated to be 0.28 ± 0.05 (95% confidence
level).  Abundance estimates based on this probability of capture were then
developed for each channel and survey.  Of the channels surveyed, only Port
Canaveral harbored significant concentrations of loggerhead turtles;
populations ranged from 701 ± 291 turtles in February to a low of 38 ± 26
turtles in August.  A few loggerhead turtles were captured in the other
channels, but infrequency of occurrence suggested random encounters rather
than areas of concentration.

turtle is accomplished through the use of the contingent valuation method.
Caddy, J.F. and R. Mahon (1995).  Reference Points for Fisheries Management . 
FAO Fisheries Technical Paper No. 347, Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations, Rome, 83 pp.
This paper reviews the conceptual background and application of
technical reference points in fishery management.  Despite considerable
investment in stock assessment methodology and expertise, fisheries worldwide
are overexploited.  This appears to be due to a mismatch between the precision
of assessment and the precision of management.  Two types of reference points
are recognized: target reference points (TRPs) and limit reference points
(LRPs).  The use of MSY as a target reference point is considered in the light
of past performance of fishery management, and it is suggested that MSY and
other reference points formerly used as targets, may be more appropriately
applied as LRPs.  The recent trend towards the quantification of uncertainty
and estimation of risk in the provision of advice is considered to be good,
but the cost and availability of information and expertise required may
preclude the use of these techniques for many small or low value stocks and
for most stocks in developing countries.  The recent trend towards inclusion
of  ecosystem concepts  in setting fishery management objectives is also seen
as good, and overdue.  Although still in their formative stages, ecosystem
concepts can still provide LRPs.  Effective management will require a  set of
rules  comprising both TRPs and LRPs.  In most national and international
fishery management situations, the current institutional structure will
probably require some modification to successfully apply these sets of rules. 
Fisheries management organizations will continue to assess and manage
fisheries routinely, but management may need to develop an independent review
which comes into play when resource production limits are approached.  The
action to be taken at such limits should be discussed and agreed on in
advance.

The relationship between estimated ex-vessel value of reported annual

regional differences in count composition of these catches, a function of
differences in shrimp laws and harvesting strategy.  It seems clear that the
strategy of harvesting large proportions of larger shrimp in Texas increases
both the weight and ex-vessel value of these catches.  Social impacts and
economic inputs beyond the ex-vessel level also require consideration in
studies of effects of harvesting strategy.

correlation analysis to test the null hypothesis that there was no
relationship between monthly sea turtle strandings and shrimp fishing effort
on the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coast during 1986-89.  A positive,
statistically significant result was found causing the null hypothesis to be
rejected.  Several caveats to the analysis are cited including the effects of
wind, waves, tides, and scavengers on the stranding levels of turtles.  These
caveats tend to reduce the implied causation that shrimp fishing effort levels
affects turtle stranding levels.

This paper challenges the W.M. Hanemann (1984) and C. Sellar, J.P.

value of nonmarket resources from ""referendum"" survey data.  These data are
more informative than conventional choice data.  The ""random utility""
interpretation of logit models is therefore too restrictive.  Bypassing the
utility function entirely, it will be shown that parameters and standard
errors for utility-theoretic inverse Hicksian demand functions can be
extracted directly and much more simply.  Estimated demand functions need not
be limited to those corresponding to the linear in parameters utility
difference specification that can be handled by packaged logit programs.

The travel cost method (TCM) has long been used to infer the economic

values.  Here, CVM survey responses are combined with TCM data on actual
market behavior to estimate jointly both the parameters of the underlying
utility function and its corresponding ordinary demand function.  This is a
prototypical empirical example of a new modeling strategy, variants of which
should provide useful in many applications, especially where reliance on a
single valuation method is undesirable.103Cameron, Trudy Ann and John Quiggin (1994).  ""Estimation Using

inefficient in that a very large number of observations are required to

alternative questioning strategy introduce a follow up dichotomous choice
question.  We generalize upon previous analyses of this type of data by
relaxing the assumption that the identical unobserved resource value motivates
both responses.  While values implied by the first and second responses are
highly correlated and may be drawn from the same distribution, they are
definitely not identical.  Furthermore, assuming that they are can severely
distort the estimated valuation distribution.

users (-$956 million), while Canadian potash producers (+$723 million), U.S.
potash producers (+$211 million), and other foreign producers (+$99 million)
were the big winners (in 1987 dollars).  Other countries that import U.S.
goods that contain potash as an input incurred additional costs of $40
million, due to higher prices of those goods, resulting in a net gain of $59
million to other countries.  U.S. taxpayers bear a lighter burden (-$55

Implications of Recruitment Seasonality: Simulation of the Texas
Fishery for the Brown Shrimp, Penaeus aztecus ."" Ecological
Modeling , 36:239-268.
The relationship between recruitment seasonality and ordination of
alternative management policies for the Texas brown shrimp ( Penaeus aztecus )
fishery is explored through utilization of a general stochastic simulation
model developed for annual crop marine fisheries.  The model represents
harvest dynamics within the fishery through a series of finite difference
equations representing recruitment, growth, migration, and mortality of brown
shrimp, and fishing effort.  The model is parameterized to reflect two
alternative representations of brown shrimp recruitment dynamics, and the
behavior of each model version is explored under four management policy
options.  The alternative recruitment representations differ in temporal
pattern of postlarval brown shrimp immigration into coastal estuaries, and the
management policy options reflect variations in seasonal closures and minimum
size restrictions for the fishery.  Analysis of model outputs identified a
statistically significant interaction between recruitment representation and
the performance of the alternative management policies based upon predicted
harvests within the fishery.  This interaction indicates the failure of the
alternative recruitment model versions to produce a consistent predicted
harvest response over all management policy options.  Under an average
representation of postlarval recruitment pattern, no significant differences
in management option performance were detected, while two of four management
options produced significantly lower harvests under a seasonally variable
recruitment pattern.

Rhode Island, Kingston, RI.
The U.S. Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Fishery under pressure from the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) and the
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has been confronted with substantial
quota reductions in recent years.  Effort reduction strategies used to sustain
these quota cuts combined with increased participation have created market
gluts and decreased the length of the season.  Apparent implications of these
problems have decreased the price received by U.S. fishermen for Atlantic
bluefin tuna.  Optimal management of the Atlantic bluefin tuna requires these
market implications be considered.  This research econometrically examines

When Fitting Theoretical Models to Data.""  Journal of the American
Statistical Association , 79(386):321-328.
Power transformations in nonlinear regression problems are investigated
when there is a physical model for the response but little understanding of
the underlying error structure.  In such circumstances, and unlike the
ordinary power transformation model, both the response and the model must be
transformed simultaneously and in the same way.  We show by asymptotic theory
and a small Monte Carlo study that for estimating the model parameters there
is little cost for not knowing the correct transform a priori; this is in
dramatic contrast to the results for the usual case where only the response is
transformed.  Possible applications of the theory are illustrated by examples.

Implementation of individual vessel quotas (IVQs) in the British
Columbia halibut fishery has provided a unique opportunity to examine the
effects of this management technique on a previously intense  derby  fishery. 
This paper describes the changes that have occurred in the fishery since the
introduction of individual vessel quotas in 1991.  The results presented here
are largely based on the finds of two surveys.  In September 1993, we
conducted in-depth interviews with most of the major halibut processors in
British Columbia.  These processors reported significant changes in the
processing and marketing of halibut.  In Spring 1993, we conducted a mail
survey of all 435 licensed halibut fishermen.  The survey consisted of several
series of questions designed to measure changes in fishing operations (crew
size, fishing practices, etc.), quota leasing activities, changes in fishing
income, and opinions about the effects of IVQs.  The results presented here
provide important information about the effects of the British Columbia
halibut IVQ program to date and will be useful for comparison to similar
management programs implemented elsewhere.

Two different methods of estimating the economic benefits that accrue to
recreationalists at Shadow Lake in Wisconsin as a result of an improvement in
that lake's water quality are developed and compared.  The conventional travel
cost model is compared to a multinomial logit share model that is able to
explicitly incorporate as arguments not only the different substitute sites
used by each lake recreationalist but also each site's quality characteristics
including water quality.  The difference in the benefit estimates derived from
these two models reflects, in part, this difference in dealing with the
substitutes.

It is apparent that the traditional economic demand relationship between

consideration has not been given to how these price proxy variables are

relationship, and present the rules and conditions for determining the nature
of the bias when the cross-price terms are omitted from the estimated, linear

this analysis, the insights gained can be employed in analyzing more
complicated, multiple site situations.
Cauvin, D.M. (1979).  ""Regulating Access in Canada's Inland Fisheries.""

Uncontrolled access in Canada's inland fisheries has served neither the
resource manager's interest in protecting fish stocks nor the economist's
interest in promoting the most efficient use of all factors of production,
including fisheries resources.  Economically accessible fisheries have
generally attracted more labor and capital than is required to harvest the
productive potential of fisheries resources.  As a result, costs of production
are high in relation to the value of production and profit margins have been
eroded.  Of equal importance, a return from the resource in the form of a
resource rent has been foregone.  Access control and a price system represent
management options to control excess fishing effort, promote economic
efficiency in the deployment of private and public resources, and promote
fiscal accountability in government.

This section addresses non-oil spill impacts on the commercial fishing
industry due to loss of access to fishing grounds, and to damage or loss of
fishing gear.  The placement of OCS structures, such as production platforms
and pipelines, in the waters of the Outer Continental Shelf, have been shown
to prevent a certain amount of ocean area from being used by fishing industry. 
This area foreclosure can lead to a potential reduction in catch for the
industry , and an associated economic loss.  OCS oil and gas activity can also
cause loss or damage to fishing gear, due to sea floor structures, debris and
other sea floor disruptions.  In certain instances, increased vessel traffic
associated with offshore oil development can cause damage to fixed fishing
gear such as pots or traps.

A new trip distribution model that hypothesizes statistical regularities
in travel behavior is developed.  To begin the development of the model,
operational definitions of origin emissiveness and destination attractiveness
were advanced.  It was pointed out that heterogeneous trip costs typically
found to exist in trip making systems tend to distort the pure trip patterns
such that the cost of travelling from each origin to each destination must be
explicitly introduced into the analysis.  A linear model, for which data
requirements are quite meager, was developed to estimate parameters of the
generalized model and test for existence of origin and destination effects,
cost effects, and origin destination interactions.  This model and the ensuing
analysis conform to what is known in statistics as the analysis of covariance.

Resources.""  Draft Report, National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Coastal marine waters and tributary river systems contain a variety of
habitats such as wetlands, sea grass beds, coral reefs, and mud flats that
collectively are essential to the reproduction, growth, and survival of a
majority of the marine fish and shellfish of the United States.  However, such
productive habitats continue to be destroyed and degraded by water development
projects, housing, agriculture, logging, water diversion, pollution and other
human induced ecosystem alterations.  Concurrently, marine fishery populations
have experienced great declines due primarily to the combined effects of
overfishing and inshore habitat degradation and loss.  Even at todays
depressed population levels, marine fishery resources are extremely valuable -
contributing $50 billion per year to the nation s GNP.  A detailed evaluation
of the composition of the U.S. commercial landings of fish and invertebrates
determined that 75% of the total (by weight) and 63% (by value) in 1991 was
composed of species that are dependent for their survival on inshore habitats. 
Moreover, between 1978 and 1991, commercial landings of inshore-dependent fish
and shellfish in the lower 48 states declined 18% in weight and 32% in value114($450 million lost annually).

Previously unresolved problems in the populations studies of the
Pribilof fur seal are reviewed.  The tagging estimates of fur seal pups may
have been biased by tag mortality and hence the apparent year class
fluctuations after 1952 may be unreal.  A set of cumulative estimates are
given for the number of pups born in each year since 1950.  These cumulative
estimates depend on the estimate of the ratio of survival of females to males
from birth to age 3.  An estimate of this ratio is given.  The implications of
this study on the population dynamics model of the fur seal are reviewed: in
particular while the exact model is less definite, the suggested optimum
population level is almost unchanged from that suggested in earlier studies.

Dynamics for a Deterministic Seasonal Fishery.""  Can J. Fish.
Aquat. Sci. , 40:2069-2079.
A dynamic fisheries model is developed to simultaneously optimize
investment in the resource stock (the fish) and investment in the capital
stock (the fleet).  Each of these investment problems faces a major
complication; investment in the resource is constrained by the natural
population dynamics, while investment in the physical capital stock tends to
be irreversible because capital used in natural resource industries is often
nonmalleable.  The model assumes a seasonal fishery in which annual escapement
and capital investment levels can be controlled.  A dynamic programming
approach is used to analyze the model heuristically and numerically.  The
comparative dynamics of optimal investment strategies are studied, with regard
to (i) delays in investment, (ii) population dynamics parameters, (iii) fish
price, (iv) capital cost, (v) depreciation rate, and (vi) discount rate.  In115particular, the depreciation rate and the ratio of unit capital costs to unit
operating costs play interesting and complex roles in determining optimal
investment levels.
Charles, Anthony T. (1983).  ""Optimal Fisheries Investment Under
Uncertainty."" Can J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. , 40:2080-2091.
A full analysis of optimal fisheries investment strategies must take
into account high levels of uncertainty in future fishery returns, as well as
irreversibility of investment in specialized, nonmalleable fishing fleets.  A
stochastic optimization model is analyzed using dynamic programming to
determine optimal policy functions for both fleet investment and fish stock
management within an uncertain environment.  The resulting policies are
qualitatively similar to those found in the corresponding deterministic case,
but quantitative differences can be substantial.  Simulation results show that
optimal fleet capacity should be expected to fluctuate over a fairly wide
range, induced by stochastic variations in the biomass.  However,d the
performance of a linear-cost risk-neutral fishery is fairly insensitive to
variations in investment and escapement policies around their optimum levels,
so that economic optimization is ""forgiving"" within this context.  A framework
of balancing upside and downside investment risks is used here to explain the
roles of several fishery parameters in relation to optimal investment under
uncertainty.  In particular, the intrinsic growth rate of the resource and the
ratio of unit capital costs to unit operating costs are found to be key
parameters in determining whether investment should be higher or lower under
uncertainty.

Charles, Anthony T. (1989).  ""Bio-Socio-Economic Fishery Models: Labour
Dynamics and Multi-Objective Management."" Can J. Fish. Aquat.
Sci., 46:1313-1322.
Fishery systems involve complex interactions between resource stocks and
the people involved in harvesting those stocks.  While the population dynamics
of fish stocks have received considerable attention in the ecological
literature, the dynamics of human communities dependent on the fishery are
equally important.  Indeed, the joint dynamics of the fish stocks and the
fishermen must be taken into account in determining appropriate management
policies.  A bio-socio-economic modelling approach is developed here to
incorporate these effects within a multi-objective optimization framework. 
Fishery labour dynamics are determined by the decisions of individual
fishermen, with net migration into and out of the fishery (and hence the
fishing community) dependent on internal conditions, such as per capita
incomes and employment rates, as well as on the state of the external economy. 
The task of fishery management is then one of balancing multiple objectives -
such as conservation, income generation, employment, and community stability -
subject to fish and fishermen dynamics.  Control theory and simulation methods
are used to study the bio-socio-economic dynamics of the fishery system and
the interactions of multiple management objectives in determining the
resulting fishery equilibrium.  Implications for fishery policy development
are also discussed.116Charles, Anthony T. and Gordon R. Munro (1985).  ""Irreversible
Investment and Optimal Fisheries Management: A Stochastic
Analysis.""  Marine Resource Economics , 1(3):247-264.
In recent years, attention has been devoted to fishery management
problems that arise because capital embodied in fishing fleets is often
nonmalleable, having few if any alternative uses.  This problem of
irreversible investment was analyzed by Clark et al. (1979), using a
deterministic model.  In reality, however, most investment decisions must be
made within an uncertain environment.  This paper describes recent efforts to
account for uncertainty in analyzing the problem of optimal fishery
investment, where the uncertainty is caused by stochastic variability in the
resource stock from year to year.

A bioeconomic model is developed to determine optimal harvest allocation
between  offshore  and  inshore  fleets exploiting a single fish stock in
sequential fisheries.  The socially optimal policy for maximizing total
discounted rent is determined in terms of optimal escapement levels in each
fishery.  Whether exclusion or coexistence of the two fleets occurs under open
access and under optimal management is found to depend primarily on
inshore/offshore price and cost ratios, together with biological parameters
related to the age structure of the fish stock.  We discuss how fishery
regulations, such as separate landings taxes imposed on each fleet, can be
used to jointly optimize open-access exploitation in sequential fisheries.

In fisheries of the developing world, where social and economic concerns
often dominate, intelligent policy making requires an adequate understanding
of both ""economic"" and ""human"" factors -- the economic structure and dynamics
of the fishery system, on the one hand, and the role of social, cultural,
institutional and political aspects on the other.  Interdisciplinary linkages
between these two elements form the essence of fishery socioeconomics, that
addresses a wide range of topics: analyses of management and developmental
goals, income distribution, social accounting, fishery ownership and access,
fisher dynamics and labor markets, the socioeconomic structure of fishing
communities, economic aspects of gender differences, the nature of fishery
decision making, and so on.
Despite its recognized practical importance, the fishery socioeconomic
literature is widely dispersed and often inaccessible.  This report presents
the results of an international effort to compile this literature and to
assess the ""state of the art"" in socioeconomic research on developing

Nonparametric Productivity Analysis: The Case of U.S. Agriculture.  
Staff Paper 372, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of
Wisconsin, Madison, WS, Feb, 19 pp.
Nonparametric methods for measuring productivity indexes based on bounds
for the underlying production technology are presented.  Following Banker and118Maindiratta, the lower bound is obtained from a primal approach while the
upper bound corresponds to a dual approach to nonparametric production
analysis.  These nonparametric bounds are then used to estimate input-based
and output-based distance functions.  These radial series data on U.S.
agriculture indicates a large gap between the primal lower bound and the dual
upper bound.  This generates striking differences between the primal and dual
nonparametric productivity indexes.

Assuming a competitive market, conditions are determined for when a
steady state equilibrium does not exist in the optimal dynamic management of a
biological population.  Irregular and unpredictable behavior (called  chaos )
can arise from rational economic decision making.  High interest rate,
adjustment costs, and an inelastic demand can contribute to market
instability.

Household expenditures for at home consumption on three species of
shellfish and five species of finfish were analyzed.  Factors explaining the
variation of expenditures on seafood commodities were own price, household
income, coupon value, household size, geographic region, urbanization, race,
and seasonality.  Own-price elasticities ranged from -0.45 (flounder/sole) to
-1.13 (oysters).  Expenditures on fishery products were more sensitive to
changes in household size than to changes in household income.  Cross-price
effects of red meat and poultry were not statistically significant.  For
comparison purposes, estimates of own price, income, and household size
elasticities from the literature were made with this set of elasticities.

Surface seawater temperature imagery from the Advanced Very High
Resolution Radiometry (AVHRR) sensor of the U.S.A.'s NOAA-11 polar orbiting
satellite is being used to reduce the impact of commercial trawl fishing on
populations of threatened and endangered sea turtles off the east coast of the
U.S.A.  During late autumn and early winter, southerly migrating summer
flounder ( Paralichthys  dentatus )and sea turtles co-occur on the narrow
continental shelf in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.  All five
sea turtle species found in this area are protected under the Endangered119Species Act (PL93-205); four of the five are known to be captured and drowned
in flounder trawl nets.  Superimposition of sea turtle positions (from aerial
surveys and at sea observers) on AVHRR imagery demonstrate that risks to sea
turtles are greatest when water temperatures are 11o or greater.  Seawater
temperatures in this area, documented by AVHRR imagery, are highly influenced
by the position and activity of the Gulf Stream, both of which are
unpredictable on time scales necessary for the management of sea
turtle/fishery interactions.  During the past three fishing seasons, turtle
conservation measures, such as tow time restrictions and turtle excluder
devices, have been imposed on the fishery.  AVHRR imagery is being used to
evaluate and modify, in near teal-time, the duration and geographic extent of
existing regulations, so that sea turtles receive adequate protection and the
fishery, with reasonable restrictions, can continue to operate.

A common property externality is defined using the right of contract
concept.  The absence of contractual stipulations governing resource use that
would exist if the fishing ground were private property, alters the constraint
of competition and affects resource allocation in a number of ways.  The
alleged externalities in fisheries are thus attributable to the absence of the
right to contract.

Fisheries - A Comparison of Different Fleet Size Reduction Policies.  
Preliminary Draft, Institute of Fisheries Economics, National Taiwan

This study compares the harvest capacity of Taiwan s offshore fishing
fleet to sustainable yields fo offshore fisheries and evaluates different
legislative strategies designed to reduce the fishing fleet.  Aggregate
fisheries resource dynamic movement and harvest functions are specified and
estimated.  Results show that the resource stock of the offshore fisheries in
Taiwan starts to decline since 1973.  Based on dynamic simulations, this study
shows that neither the  Program to Restrict the Building of New Vessels  nor a
combination of this program with the  Vessel Retirement and Buyback Program 
is sufficient to avoid the downward trend in fisheries harvests and the
deteriorating state of fisheries resource stocks.  While reducing fishing
effort to maximum sustainable yields (MSY) might suffice as an initial vessel
reduction measure, attaining MSY within 5 to 10 years seems preferable over
one year approach.  The long-run economic situation would be further improved
by an additional reduction of fishing effort to the optimal yield (OY) level.

Relative biomass was much higher on the brown shrimp grounds than on the
white shrimp grounds.  Relative biomass was much higher in summer than during
winter, especially on the white shrimp grounds.  Overall, 11.35 volumes of
discard were landed to one volume of headed shrimp.  We estimate that about
219,050 metric tons of fish were discarded annually in the Gulf by Texas-based120shrimp trawlers during the period 1962-71.  Typical life spans appear to be
only one or two years, so that these fishes must mature rapidly.  Their
theoretical total annual mortality rates are about 90-100%, so that there must
be a rapid turnover of biomass on the shrimp grounds.  Fishes with this type
of life cycle tend to withstand extensive fishing without danger of over
harvesting, so that they apparently have great fisheries potential.  The Gulf
shrimp fishery at present does not appear to be over harvesting the demersal
fishes.

Bycatch, Considerations for Today and Tomorrow , Alaskan Sea Grant
College Program Report No. 96-03, University of Alaska, Fairbanks,
Alaska, 322 pp.
Discarding of nontarget species and sizes of fish by commercial fishing
vessels is a common practice in many fisheries around the world and is
currently estimated at 27 million tons globally.  Efforts to reduce discarding
through mechanical selection were started over 100 years ago and were the
precursor to mesh selectivity research in many European countries.  The
release of fish through mechanical selection is now a preferred management
tool in many fisheries.  In recent years, research into fish mortality after
escape has shown that mortalities vary by gear type and species, may be
immediate or delayed, and may be due to injuries or stressors associated with
capture-escape trauma.  In addition to escape mortality, there are other
unaccounted mortalities associated with different capture technologies. This
paper reviews sources of unaccounted fishing mortality, presents a general
model of the capture process, and proposes a set of conservation technology
penalties for discards, ghost fishing, and escape mortalities for each gear
type and fleet sector.  An effective conservation philosophy for reducing
resource waste must include a shift of research to the commercial sector and a
review program to allow for penalty reductions when new technologies are
introduced.

for Meat with a Flexible Utility Function.""  Journal of

Direct and indirect translog utility functions provide budget share
equations that are both flexible and consistent with the theory of utility
maximization.  These forms are attractive for modeling consumer behavior. 
Because of their flexibility they are ideal for testing hypotheses such as
additivity of preferences.  In this paper, we use the translog methodology to
analyze U.S. consumption of the four principal categories of meat-fish, beef,
poultry, and pork.  We decisively reject the hypothesis of additivity. 
However, further testing for partial additivity reveals that (beef) and (fish,
poultry, pork) are additively separable subgroups of meat.

Review, 65(3):367-383.
A test of the theory of demand is developed that does not employ
additivity of homotheticity as part of the maintained hypothesis.  Secondly,
the duality between prices and quantities in the theory of demand is
exploited.  The indirect utility function is represented by functions that are
quadratic in the logarithms of ratios of prices to total expenditure,
paralleling the treatment of the direct utility function.  The resulting
indirect utility functions provide a local second-order approximation to any121indirect utility function.

Shrimp ( Pandalus  borealis ) is by far the most important species in the
Greenland fisheries and the present basis of Greenland's economy (90% of total
exports and 30% of the world supply of cold water shrimp).  To provide
guidance on the effects of yield from management measures designed to reduce
the quota by 20% for 1993, this paper presents a bioeconomic analysis based on
estimates of the total mortality, growth, discard, and the 1991 operating
costs that determines the resource rent and optimum effort of the shrimp
fishery in the Davis Strait.  Effort must be reduced by at least 40% compared
to the 1991 level to obtain MEY.  The gain in economic rent is estimated to be
at least 19% compared to the economic rent of 1991.

This paper presents a bioeconomic analysis determining the resource rent
and optimum effort of the shrimp ( Pandalus  borealis ) fishery in the Davis
Strait taking into account the discard behavior of the fleet.  It is
demonstrated that from an economic point of view the shrimp stock in the Davis
Strait is substantially overfished.  To obtain the maximum economic yield, the
effort must be reduced by at least 40% compared to the effort level of 1991. 
The gain in resource rent by reducing effort is estimated to be at least 20%
compared to the resource rent of 1991.

Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C., September, 8 pp.
This paper discusses the economic consequences of common property
natural resources and suggests some economic criteria that may help to provide
the basis for improvements in the efficient exploitation of marine resources. 
First, different kinds of common property resources and the reasons why use of
these resources is shared rather than appropriated by individuals or firms are
identified.  Second, some of the more damaging consequences of common property
exploitation are discussed with particular emphasis on economic inefficiency. 
The need for public control and that the choice of objectives for control
measures should include economic criteria is pointed out.  Finally, policy and
research problems that need to be solved if marine resource exploitation is to
become more efficient in an economic sense are raised.

This paper is an attempt to collate the new paradigm of property rights

paradigm of common property or open access fisheries management and the costs
associated with maintaining them.  It then postulates the future paradigms as
a basis for setting the goals towards which we should be striving and for
identifying the most significant obstacles in the path.  The forces at work
that are leading to the new paradigms are discussed.  The paper concludes with
an identification of some of the challenges for administration and research.

The coastal zone of South China is characterized by many features that
are shared by other developing countries.  It is a long inhabited area with
lengthy coastlines, dotted by several modern cities and a large number of
fishing ports.  Because of heavy population pressure, large demand for food,
and the drive to develop modern industries, extensive embankment and
reclamation schemes are undertaken, leading to many ecological feedbacks, such
as heavy silting of the estuaries, pollution of coastal waters, and depletion
of fishery resources nearby.  The recent development of offshore oil and gas
fields on the continental shelf of the South China Sea has further complicated
the issue.  On the other hand, one can anticipate rapid economic development
along the coast; on the other, there is higher risk of environmental
disasters.  It is thus necessary to strengthen the present environmental
surveillance system and the research effort on the environmental economics of
the area.

model takes into account the response of the population to harvesting
pressure, the increasing harvesting costs associated with decreasing

on certain easily stated biological and economic conditions, extermination of
the entire population may appear as the most attractive policy, even to an

are theoretically equivalent to one another in terms of economic efficiency,
and both are capable in principle of optimizing exploitation of the common-

Shrimp fishermen trawling in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic
inadvertently capture and kill turtles that are classified as endangered127species.  Recent legislation requires the use of a Turtle Excluder Device
(TED) that when placed in the shrimp trawl prevents turtle mortality.  The
impact of the TED on shrimp production is not known.  Analysis of TED
regulations using an annual firm level simulation model indicated that the
average gulf fleet had a low probability of being an economic success before
enacting the regulations.  An assumption that the TED regulations result in
decreased production aggravated this condition, while an analysis assuming a
positive impact on production slightly improved the economic viability of the
firm.  When an analysis was conducted on a monthly basis considering industry
wide interaction between landings per vessel in one time period and available
shrimp stock the next, the impact of the TED regulations was mitigated.  A
decrease (increase) in effective effort each time period, as the result of
using a TED, increased (decreased) available stock in succeeding time periods
and reduced the negative (positive) impact upon production.  In both analyses,
a negative impact of the TED on shrimp production resulted in a decline in the
economic viability of the firm.  Likewise, a positive impact improved the
firm's economic viability.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the costs and returns to128individual gulf vessels of using a turtle excluder device, a key issue in the
ongoing debate over whether TEDs should be used.  The results of four

""Simulated Economic Impact of TED Regulations on Selected Vessels
in the Texas Shrimp Fishery.""  Marine Fisheries Review , 53(2):1-8.
Shrimp fishermen trawling in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic
inadvertently capture and kill sea turtles that are classified as endangered
species.  Recent legislation requires the use of a Turtle Excluder Device
(TED), that when in place in the shrimp trawl, reduces sea turtle mortality. 
The impact of the TED on shrimp production is not known.  This intermediate
analysis of the TED regulations using an annual firm level simulation model
indicates that the average Texas shrimp vessel had a low probability of being
an economic success before regulations were enacted.  An assumption that the
TED regulations resulted in decreased production aggravated this condition and
the change in Ending Net Worth and Net Present Value of Ending Net Worth
before and after a TED was placed in the net was significant at the 5 percent
level.
However, the difference in the Internal Rate of Return for the TED and
non-TED simulations was not significant unless the TED caused a substantial
change in catch.  This analysis did not allow for interactions between the
fishermen in the shrimp industry, an assumption that could significantly alter
the impact of TED use on the catch and earnings of the individual shrimp
vessel.

Vessel length or horsepower are used as proxies for firm size in an

the fishing industry.  The price of fish although statistically insignificant
in the linear model had a positive effect on the level of new investment. 
Fuel prices and the interest rate were not statistically significant in the
model due to the nature of the data or the behavior of fishermen,
respectively.  The grant rate was highly significant in determining the level
of investment in a new boat.  However, this may have been a dominate variable
in the regression equation causing other important variables to appear
insignificant.129Clark, Stephen H. and Charles W. Caillouet, Jr. (1973).  ""White Shrimp

Laboratory Reference No. 79-05, January, NOAA, NMFS, NEFC, Woods
Hole Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts 02543.
Haddock ( Melanogrammus aeglefinus ) constituted New England's most
important groundfish resource for many decades and from the early 1920's to
the mid-1960's was one of the most valuable fishery resources in the United
States; total landed value averaged between 10 and 12 million dollars from
1940-1960 and increased to a record high of 13.9 million dollars in 1966
(Lyles, 1968), before declining in subsequent years.  Prior to 1900, this
species was of minor importance, being inferior to cod ( Gadus morhua ) for
salting purposes, and consequently it was little utilized in historical times
although use of ice aboard some of the bank vessels towards the close of the
19th century resulted in development of a limited fishery (Smith and Olson,
MS, 1976).  Introduction of filleting and freezing methods, however, resulted
in an expanded market for haddock (Schuck, 1951) and with the introduction of
otter trawls and diesel engines, the USA haddock fishery expanded rapidly. 
Landings from all areas reached an all-time high of 132,300 metric tons in
1929 before declining to an average of 66,000 tons from 1931-1965;
subsequently landings declined precipitously with the collapse of the Georges
Bank haddock fishery in the late 1960's.  Total USA landings averaged
approximately 5,000 tons from 1972-1976; provisional statistics for 1977
indicate a total USA catch of 12,900 tons, and preliminary estimates for 1978
indicate a USA catch of 17,700 tons.

Fisheries Review , 51(1):33-38.
Sampling is a key element in the assessment of any fish stock.  It is
often one of the most expensive activities of the management process; thus,
improved efficiency can result in significant cost savings.  In most cases a
two phase sampling strategy is employed.  Two commonly used versions of such
stratified random schemes were simulated using a test population based on
Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua.  A 1 otolith per 1 cm length frequency currently
used for many flatfish and some smaller gadoids and a 3 otolith per 3 cm
length frequency currently used for many of the larger gadoids.  No difference
was detected in the age composition or mean length at age for either scheme;130however, 10 percent fewer otoliths were collected in 1 for 1 sampling than 3
for 3.  There was an improvement of between 30 and 60 percent in the
coefficient of variation of the estimated catch numbers at age using the 1 for
1 compared with the 3 for 3 stratified sampling.  For these reasons and other
operations considerations, the 1 for 1 stratified random design of sampling
appears to be superior.

""Differences in Dolphin Mortality Rates in Night and Day Sets for
the U.S. Eastern Tropical Pacific Tuna Purse Seine Fishery."" 
Marine Fisheries Review , 54(2):7-14.131Because dolphins sometimes travel with yellowfin tuna, Thunnus
albacares , in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP), purse seiners use the
dolphins to locate and capture tuna schools.  During the process of setting
the purse seine nets, dolphins often become entangled and drown before they
can be released.  Data for the U.S. purse seine fleet in the ETP during 1979-
88 show that dolphin mortality rates in sets made during the night are higher
than mortality rates in sets made during the day.  Even with efforts to reduce
night set mortality rates through the use of high intensity floodlights, night
set mortality rates remain higher.  The data are also used to simulate a
regulation on the fishery aimed at eliminating night sets and show that
dolphin mortality rates would decrease.

This paper describes a computer program which has been written to
provide maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a number of
stochastic production and cost functions.  The stochastic frontier models
considered can accommodate (unbalanced) panel data and assume firm effects
that are distributed as truncated normal random variables.  The two primary
model specifications considered in the program are an error components
specification with time-varying efficiencies permitted (Battese and Coelli,
1992), which was estimated by FRONTIER Version 2.0, and a model specification
in which the firm effects are directly influenced by a number of variables
(Battese and Coelli, 1993).  The computer program also permits the estimation
of many other models which have appeared in the literature through the
imposition of simple restrictions.  Asymptotic estimates of standard errors
are calculated along with individual and mean efficiency estimates.

The majority of DEA studies use a two-stage linear programming (LP)
process to solve orientated DEA models.  There are two significant problems
associated with the second stage of this process.  The first is that the sum
of slacks is maximized rather than minimized and hence will identify not the
nearest efficient point but the furthest efficient point.  The second problem
is that it is not invariant to units of measurement.  In this paper, we
propose a multi-stage DEA methodology which involves a sequence of radial
LP s.  We observe that this new approach will identify more representative
efficient points and that it is also invariant to units of measurement.  The
methodology is illustrated using a simple example.

Analysis of Efficiency in Fisheries.   Department of Economics,

Economists have often used econometrics to estimate stochastic
production frontiers to assess the level of efficiency of individual
enterprises.  Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been proposed as an
alternative approach to measure the relative efficiency of individual
enterprises.  A key advantage of DEA is that, unlike econometric approaches,
it does not require a specific production function to be imposed.  In this
paper, DEA is used to estimate the relative efficiency of demersal trawlers
operating in the English Channel.  The results from this analysis are compared
to the results of an econometric analysis using the same data.  Conclusions
about the relative benefits of the approaches are presented.  The results
suggest that the econometric production frontier approach may result in some
efficient boats appearing as inefficient.

fisheries.  The upper bound of the accident s first year social costs on these
resources is $108 million, approximately 27 percent of exvessel value.  Second134year effects may have been as high as $47 million.  More probable estimates of
the oil spill s actual social costs are likely less than these amounts. 
Precise determination of the accident s impacts is constrained by the dynamic

Dynamics in a Fluctuating Environment.   Canadian Journal of Fisheries

Large fluctuations in the abundance of marine fish are revealed in scale
deposits from before the twentieth century and are thought to be
environmentally induced.  We investigate how a fluctuating environment and
predation may combine to cause abrupt shifts in fish abundance on decadal time
scales.  For example, the biomass of Pacific herring ( Clupea pallasi ) off
Vancouver Island appears to be negatively related to sea surface temperature
(SST) and the abundance of its predator, Pacific hake ( Merluccius  productus ). 
We used first-order differential equations to develop a two species, predator-
prey model faced with stochastic variability.  A nonlinear, predator
functional response potentially gives rise to multiple equilibrium abundance
levels.  Environmental variability was simulated as  red noise  (variance is a
decreasing function of frequency) with a spectrum derived from SST data. 
Stochastic variations caused the predator-prey abundances to shift between
high and low equilibrium levels.  Fishing the prey population can precipitate
collapses to the low equilibrium level and prolong the time to recovery.  When
run with actual catches and SST anomalies from 1951 to 1988, the model
simulated prey abundances with a pattern similar to the observed herring
biomass.

The paper bridges the gap between optimal foraging models and predator-
prey or parasitoid-host population models.  The parasitoid optimal foraging
model that we derive assumes each individual parasitoid to maximize its rate
of encounter with healthy hosts in a patchy environment.  The model is used to
generate the searching strategy of a population of parasitoids, from which
their overall searching efficiency can be calculated.  We then explore the135dynamics of a difference equation population model in which the parasitoids
forage optimally.  The conditions for local stability are derived and some
global properties discussed.  Although optimal foraging is important to
parasitoid reproductive fitness, the resulting dynamics are qualitatively
similar to those produced by the model of Hassell & May (1973) in which the
parasitoids do not forage optimally but have a fixed aggregation strategy.

Fisheries Review , 55(4):1-13.
Sea cucumbers ( Holothuridae  and Stichopodidae ) have been harvested
commercially for at least 1,000 years.  The world fisheries for sea cucumbers,
however, are not well documented and in general are poorly managed.  Depending
upon the species exploited, there are two processing procedures for the sea
cucumber product.  Some species are eaten raw, while most commercial species
are processed into a dry product called beche-de-mer or trepang.  This dry
product is exported to a central market such as Hong Kong and then re-exported
to the consumers.  In this review, recent statistics on the world sea cucumber
fisheries, collected from different services, are detailed for each major
fishing area.  Case studies for each fishing area are also presented.  Recent
major changes in the Indo-Pacific fishery include the participation of new
producer countries, the shift in the species being exploited, and an increase
in the Chinese market.  The expansion of the largely monospecific temperate
North Pacific fisheries is also described.  Statistics from Hong Kong,
Singapore, Taiwan, and the Food and Agriculture Organization provide valuable
information on the producer and importer countries.  Particular attention is
paid to the reciprocal trade of beche-de-mer between Hong Kong and Singapore. 
An evaluation of the world sea cucumber landings and beche-de-mer production
is presented.  Recent developments include an expansion of the Hong Kong
market due to increased demand by China, the importance of Indonesia as a
major world producer, and an increase in the fisheries of Tropical Pacific
nations.  This increase is best documented for New Caledonia and Fiji.  Ways
to improve the access and the reliability of the statistics for the sea
cucumber fishery are discussed, as is the potential for management of136artisanal fisheries.

The use of models in management of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shrimp

primarily limited to a continuing reevaluation of two narrowly constructed
management measures that were designed to provide moderate increases in yield. 
Areas of major social or ecological concern and areas in which yield can be
dramatically enhanced have received little attention.  Specific examples
discussed include wetland loss, the use of TEDs, and the excessive growth-
overfishing that occurs in some states.

assimilation efficiencies for proteins and lipids were consistently high; for
carbohydrates, low.  Organic assimilation per gram organic weight of white
shrimp, Penaeus  setiferus , proceeded at 3.7 mg hr-1 on an axenic diatom and

components of the mat.  Feeding mechanisms and probable natural diets are
discussed as a basis for further study.

A generalized method for analyzing stability potential in discrete time
renewable resource models subject to market driven harvest is discussed.  Two
means by which harvest activity can influence dynamical properties of
renewable resource models are identified: the  growth factor  and the  market
response effect .  The growth factor is a systematic influence on stability
tied to changes in the position of the bioeconomic equilibrium point along a
given open access supply locus.  The market response effect involves variation
in harvest in response to stock level changes.  Enhancing the harvest response
by changing the slope of the demand schedule can thrust the model into
instability, chaos, and extinction without changing the bioeconomic
equilibrium point for the Pacific Halibut Fishery Model based on a modified
discrete time version of the traditional Schaefer model.  Enhancing harvest
response via slope preserving increases in market demand can push the model
into instability, chaos, and even extinction.  Finally, similar adjustments in
market demand may be capable of eliminating instability and chaos rooted in
powerful intrinsic growth of the stock.

Conrad, Jon M. (1985).  ""Residuals Management: Disposal of Sewage Sludge
in the New York Bight.""  Marine Resource Economics , 1(4):321-345.
This paper discusses a problem facing New York and several other coastal
cities: how and where they should dispose of the sludge produced in the
treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater.  A dynamic model of sludge
accumulation is constructed that identifies conditions under which it is
optimal to  cease and switch  or dispose simultaneously at both near shore and
offshore sites.  Environmental conditions in the New York bight are discussed
along with incidents occurring during the summer of 1976 that galvanized
public concern over the amount and types of contaminants entering the bight. 
While sludge-related were not a major factor in either incident, the cost of
sludge-related degradation, particularly if inner bight fisheries were well
managed, is probably sufficient to warrant disposing of sludge at the more
distant 106 mile site.  It is important to institute ecological and economic
monitoring of both the offshore and near shore sites if the role of ocean
disposal in residuals management is to be better defined.
Conrad, Jon M. (1987).  ""The Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and
Management Act: An Economic Assessment of the First 10 Years."" 
Marine Fisheries Review , 49(3):3-12.
The Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act was enacted in
1976 and implemented in 1977.  In an analysis of data collected by the
National Marine Fisheries Service one observes a significant increase in the
landings of fish and shellfish and in nominal and real ex-vessel revenue.  The
present value of net variable revenues for the 1968-76 period was estimated at
$1.1 billion compared with #3.8 billion for the 1977-85 period.  The increase
in net revenues, however, appears to be declining due to the increase in the
number of vessels in the U.S. domestic fleet.  The time path for net revenues
suggests that the industry is headed toward a new (purely domestic) open
access equilibrium where revenue equals cost and the imputed value of the
resource is driven to zero (rent dissipation).  It is well known that open
access results in welfare losses to both consumers and the fishing industry. 
If these welfare losses are to be avoided, the eight regional management
councils and the Department of Commerce must adopt policies that will reduce
yield in the short run (thereby allowing stocks to increase) and efficiently
harvest optimum yield in the long run.  Transferable quotas for single species
fisheries and transferable effort quotas (rights) in multispecies fisheries
are attractive because they encourage efficient (least cost) harvest and
afford flexibility in a world where the stocks of individual species are
subject to fluctuation.  Discussion by Ivar Strand.

Systems: The Case of Tuna in the Eastern Tropical Atlantic."" 
Journal of Environmental Economics and Management , 13(1):50-68.
The commercial tuna fishery in the Eastern Tropical Atlantic is based on
harvests from three species of tuna: Yellowfin, Skipjack, and Bigeye.  Two
models are developed to examine the bioeconomics of this fishery.  In the
first model, species are presumed ecologically independent and selectively
harvested.  In the second model, two of the species (Yellowfin and Skipjack)
are assumed to be interspecific competitors and jointly harvested independent
of the third species (Bigeye).  Data on landings, effort, cost, and revenue
are assembled allowing estimates of the bioeconomic parameters for the model
where all species are independent and selectively harvested.  Open access and
bioeconomic equilibria are identified for a combination of cost and discount
rates.  The pristine, open access, and bioeconomic equilibria are also
determined for the multispecies model based on parameters from the single
species (independent) models and plausible values for interaction and joint
production coefficients.  Equilibria are compared, and management policies
from a single and multispecies perspective are explored.

These lectures are an attempt to review the relatively recent advances

the impediments to applying modern production theory when estimating
bioeconomic parameters.  The first lecture reviews the relationship between
the production function, the growth function, and the yield effort function
for the single species fishery and extends these concepts to the multispecies
fishery using the multiple output production function.  In the second lecture,
the early literature on fisheries production is reviewed.  The assumptions
underlying duality based estimation techniques as they relate to multispecies
production are examined in greater detail.  The third lecture discusses recent
empirical work on the New England trawler fleet.

pp.139The Fishery Conservation Zone (FCZ) off the coast of Texas has been
closed to shrimping since 1981 (mid May to mid July) to coincide with the
closure of the Texas territorial sea.  These areas were closed to increase the
size of commercially harvested brown shrimp.  The econometric analysis of
brown shrimp supply-demand relationships for three shrimp sizes (small: more
than 67 tails per pound; medium: 31-67 tails per pound; and large: less than
31 tails per pound) estimated the changes in ex-vessel prices associated with
simulated changes in landings.  The estimate 0.4 million pound increase in
landings due to the FCZ closure resulted in an increase in revenue of $6.7
million for May 1983 through April 1984.  Preliminary estimates of the closure
effect for May-August 1984 show a decrease in landings of 0.8 million pounds
with an increase in revenue of $5.8 million.  Changes in landings and value
are due to the estimated decrease in catch of lower valued small shrimp with
an increase in higher valued medium and large shrimp.  The combined closure of
the Texas territorial sea and the Texas FCZ in 1983 was estimated to have
increased brown shrimp landings by 3.5 million pounds, with a resulting
increase in revenue of $31.7 million for May 1983 through April 1984.

of Linear Logit Models to Input Demand Studies: A More General
Formulation.""  College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell
and the Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Rhode
Island Contribution #1970.
Linear logit models have been criticized by t.H. Oum (1979) on the
grounds that they imply rigid a priori restrictions of the cross-price
elasticities and on the elasticities of substitution.  The purpose of this
paper is to show that Oum's results are attributed solely to the restrictive
model specifications identified by the author and not to the analytical
properties of linear logit models.  A more general formulation of a
multinomial logit model for cost shares is presented, and with this
specification, the price elasticities and elasticities of substitution do not
depend on the selection of the base mode.  Furthermore, predicted expenditures
are always positive.  In addition, the adding up properties that are
characteristic of a multinomial problem are automatically satisfied.  The
model also provides considerable flexibility since the inclusion of
noneconomic explanatory variables does not affect the economic properties of
the model.

The exclusion from U.S. waters since 1981 has greatly reduced the
harvest potential for Canada's Pacific halibut fleet, making it particularly
important that halibut resources in the Canadian zone be exploited at optimal
levels.  This paper provides a bioeconomic analysis of the joint-stock fishery
in Area 2 convention waters.  Using Canadian cost and revenue relationships,
optimal harvesting levels are established according to three different
criteria, including not only the maximization of resource rent, but also the
maximization of a more inclusive social surplus and the maximization of
benefits for the harvesting sector.  Estimates are made of halibut demand, as
well as yield-effort and cost-effort relationships to calculate the various
optima.  The implications of this analysis for a Canadian fleet confined to
the Canadian 200 mile zone of Area 2 are then discussed.

This study reviews the Maldives' overall fiscal situation and assesses
the likely contribution of the fisheries sector in the medium term.  Options
for increasing revenues are discussed.  The main recommendations are (1) the
current exemption of fishing vessels from paying the vessel registration fee
should be eliminated; (2) The 120 day rule should likewise be eliminated.  A
parallel regulation to ensure continued provision of landings data to the
island clerks would be required, with loss of the fishing license imposed as a
sanction in the event of non-reporting; (3) MIFCO currently provides about 40
percent of the catching sector's fuel supplies.  The company has recently been
granted exemption from fuel excise.  Since this will provide an unfair
advantage compared to privates sector suppliers, it is suggested that the
exemption be extended to all fuel supplies to the fishing industry; (4) While
an export tax on processed fish represents a straight forward method of
revenue generation it is not recommended, based on both economic efficiency
and social criteria.  Overall, the government's options with respect to
increasing revenues from the sector appear to be limited.

The distributive branch of government must calculate the income tax for
optimal redistribution by maximizing a social welfare function constrained by
technology and the announcement effects of the tax.  A partial equilibrium
analysis that takes into account the announcement effect upon work effort
shows that the marginal tax rate that is optimal for any particular social
welfare function increases with inequality in the distribution of productive
skill.  The ranking of social welfare functions by size of optimal marginal
tax rate was Rawls > Nash > Bentham > Elitist, regardless of the distribution
of productive skill or the elasticity of substitution.  The inverse of this
ranking did not always correspond to the ranking of social welfare functions
by the size of the Gini coefficient.  The social welfare function implicit in
actual U.S. government transfer activity under Musgrave's best assumption and
the intermediate ability distribution was democratic, as predicted by the
median rule.
Copes, P. (1970).  ""The Backward-Bending Supply Curve of the Fishing
Industry."" Scottish Journal of Political Economy , 17(1):69-77.
The economic theory of fisheries has emphasized the common property
nature of the fishery resource that generally leads to an over exploitation
and dissipation of the rent that the resource could have yielded.  The
literature stresses on the supply side the relationship of output to the
amount of fishing effort and hence to cost.  But the consequences of these and
other relationships in terms of conventional supply and demand analysis do not
appear to have been treated exhaustively.  This article demonstrates that the
long run supply curve of a fishery may be expected to exhibit a negative slope
for higher price ranges.  A few of the consequences of this phenomenon are
explored.
Copes, P. (1972) ""Factor Rents, Sole Ownership, and the Optimum Levels

Economic theory as applied to common property resources such as
fisheries holds that rents will be dissipated resulting in losses to society
using maximum net economic yield as a measurement criteria.  This article
applies conventional welfare maximization to balance the considerations of
resource rent with that of competing social benefits that may be derived from
the exploitation of a fishery; focusing on consumer and producer surplus
accruing to factors other than the fishery resource itself.

The author presents many sound arguments against the use of individual142quotas as a fisheries management instrument citing the results of actual

""rationalization"" process unless they are transferable.  However individual
transferable quotas have unsightly equity and income reallocation effects. 
The question that remains unanswered in the paper is whether ITQ's are
preferable to the common property or open access fishery scenario.

The objective of this paper is to present an analytical description and
classification of observable impacts that individual quota (IQ) regimes may
have on social conditions affecting fishers and fishing communities.  The
pursuit of greater net benefits to society that is the purported purpose of IQ
regimes, suggest compatibility with a general goal of greater social welfare. 
However, there are a number of reasons why IQ regimes may fail in this regard
and instead may be the cause of adverse impacts on social welfare.  Three
reasons are conceptual exclusion, conventional disregard, and injection of
negative externalities.  In choosing a fisheries management system, the
challenge now is to reach consensus on a multiobjective decision-making
process which will give agreed weights in trading off measures of economic
efficiency and social desirability that need to be taken into account.

Because of the labor required in separating northern shrimp from the
unwanted components of the catch that are taken along with it, this valuable
resource in the Gulf of Maine is not harvested to the extend possible. 
Consequently, a machine was developed to separate the shrimp from the bulk of
groundfish and other species taken in trawl catches during exploratory and
commercial fishing.  Its use eliminates the laborious task of sorting the
catch by hand.  Yet the separator recovers about 95 percent of the shrimp that
are fed into it, while eliminating about 90 percent of the trash.

science.  It is proposed that Karl Popper s technological social science,
designed to solve problems of social tradition of which overfishing is an
example would fill this lacuna.  This technology would employ the services of
a social engineer, a modern fisheries manager, who should use the pre-
scientific method of trial and error and the negative guidance of bold pattern
predications to re-evacuate the institutions of fisheries management.

This paper extends the study of the commons to include a nonzero143conjectural variation regarding what one exploiter thinks will be the effect
of his exploitation on the exploitation efforts of others.  The resulting
analysis indicates that the degree of over- or underexploitation of the
commons depends on the particular conjecture and the underlying technology. 
For a representative commons model we show that consistent conjectures, those
that conform with reality, cannot characterize standard Nash equilibria. 
Additionally, non-Nash behavior is shown to be inconsistent in all but one
case, a case corresponding to zero profits even in the instance of a finite
number of firms.

Symposium on Mitigation of Impacts and Losses, October 8-10,
International Hotel, New Orleans, LA.
A willingness-to-pay and energy analysis valuation techniques were used
to estimate the value of an acre of Louisiana wetlands.  It seems clear that
no amount of effort will produce very precise estimates of wetland values and
we suspect this is also the case for several other classes of natural
resources.  One school of thought holds that until precise estimates of
wetland values are available we should not attempt to evaluate these resources
at all, or should use only the market price.  A second school holds that
wetlands are priceless, their real value can never be even imprecisely
quantified and we should therefore spare no expense in preserving them.  We
contend that there are rational methods for dealing with this imprecision and
uncertainty without taking either of these extreme positions.  We elaborate a
Wetlands Trust Fund system that would solve most of the problems.

indirect polices such as tariff reforms may in some cases provide better means
for reducing upland erosion than would direct environmental policies.

Within most fisheries policies, social objectives have hitherto been
unstated, non-specific or unprioritized.  The policies have, in effect, been
driven by conservation and economically orientated goals.  Trends in the North
Atlantic fisheries have necessitated the down scaling of fishing effort and
the schemes for reducing fishing capacity carry profound implications for the
social welfare of fishing communities and fishery dependent regions.  Within
the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy, serious consideration is now145being given to the formulation of social objectives.  A key question is
whether those objectives should be internalized within the fisheries
management strategies or remain externalized and devolved to other policy
sectors (social policy, regional policy, etc.).  The paper explores the scope
for incorporating social objectives in alternative management strategies and
develops an agenda for policy related social science research.  It draws upon
the proceedings of an European Union funded international workshop held in
Brussels in May, 1994.

Cronin, Francis J. (1982).  Valuing Nonmarket Goods Through Contingent
Markets .  Prepared for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by
Battelle, Pacific Northwest Laboratory.
To estimate the value of public good externalities and thus determine
their efficient levels of production, several researchers have recommended the
use of interview techniques.  In fact, contingent market valuations of
externalities have recently been employed in studies of recreational activity
and visibility.  Furthermore, because of the limitations inherent in other
techniques and society's increased concern with allocation efficiency,
contingent market valuation is likely to become an important tool in
determining the types and levels of public goods produced.
Despite the recent spate of studies employing contingent markets,
uncertainties remain regarding the existence and impacts of biases often
associated with this technique.  Included among these are hypothetical bias,
strategic bias, information bias, and interviewer bias.  If the results of
contingent market valuation are to be credible, the uncertainties surrounding
these biases must be resolved.  If no biases exist, no actions need be taken;
if biases do exist, however, methods to mitigate their impacts or to estimate
their influences must be developed.
This paper estimates the extent and significance of three biases
associated with contingent market analysis - strategic bias, information bias,
and interviewer bias.  The contingent market analyzed is that for improved
water quality.  The values households place on improved water quality are
obtained from a random sample of almost 2,000 households in Washington, D.C.
metropolitan reach of the Potomac River.  Thus, the analysis also provides
information necessary to select the optimal level of water quality.
The findings indicate that the value attached to improved water quality
is substantially higher than that estimated in prior studies.  Perhaps of more
general importance, the findings support the hypothesis that respondents
engage in strategic behavior.  Respondents who were given incentives to bias
their revealed value downward were found to have mean bids significantly lower
than households who were given incentives to bias their revealed values
upward.  In addition, statistically significant evidence supporting the
existence of both information and interviewer bias was found.

This paper presents two sets of conditions under which a sole owner of a
renewable resource stock who maximizes a nonlinear benefit function would find
it more profitable to harvest the stock to extinction than follow a continuous
harvesting strategy. When the minimum viable resource stock is positive,
extinction is optimal as long as the initial resource stock is sufficiently
small, regardless of the discount rate.  When the minimum viable resource
stock is zero and the discount rate exceeds the growth potential of the
species extinction is optimal for sufficiently small initial stocks.

Though not its specific intent, the 1981 amendment of the Lacey Act
transformed a traditional practice among south Texas shrimpers-fishing in

amendment this practice was overlooked by U.S. authorities and only
sporadically controlled by Mexican authorities.  Federal strategies for Lacey

led to an escalation of conflict between U.S. fishermen and authorities. 
Drawing on official documents and extensive interviews with both shrimpers and

interaction over time and applies Turk's theory of normative-legal conflict to
explain the course of that interaction.147Crouse, Deborah T., Larry B. Crowder, and Hal Caswell (1987).   A Stage-Based

refining our knowledge about the population dynamics of threatened loggerhead
sea turtles ( Caretta  caretta ).  Population projections are used to examine the
sensitivity of Frazer s life table to variations in parameter estimates as
well as the likely response of the population to various management
alternatives.  Current management practices appear to be focused on the least
responsive life stage, eggs on nesting beaches.  Alternative protection
efforts for juvenile loggerheads, such as using turtle excluder devices (TEDs)
may be far more effective.

Lessons from the Geological Record.""  Consequences , 2(1):3-12.
Were the earth to warm by the 2o C given in the middle range of the
consensus projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the
mean surface temperature would climb to higher values than any known in the
last two million years.  Were the amount of carbon dioxide in the air to
double, the surface temperatures would rise even higher.  We have now consumed
about 5 percent of the total reservoir of fossil fuels, predominantly coal,
that is still in the ground.  Were we to burn all or most of what remains, the
carbon dioxide released to the air could drive global surface temperatures to
levels last known about 100 million years ago, at the time of the dinosaurs. 
While questions remain regarding possible, ameliorating feedbacks from other
elements of the climate system, all that is known from the record of the past
confirms a direct connection between greenhouse gases and surface temperature.

Two recent articles by Gordon and Scott present an interesting analysis
of the conditions for economic maximization in a renewable resource industry
the primary raw material for which is drawn from the public domain.  While
their criticism of the concepts that now govern fishery conservation programs
will be generally accepted among the handful  of economists dealing with the
fishing industry, some aspects of the problem call for additional
consideration.  In this paper I should like to elaborate and modify the
general outlines of the analysis, largely in terms of a specific and important
case: the Pacific halibut fishery.

The time is ripe to take a careful look at our techniques of fishery
management from the standpoint of their economic effects. Accepting without
further inquiry the fact that rational utilization of the major Pacific Coast
fish populations requires limitation of fishing mortality, let us turn to two
equally significant questions: how can this limitation of catch be made
effective, and which of the alternative methods will minimize the long run148cost of any given level of output selected?

Main Policy Alternatives for Controlling Fishing Effort.""  J.
Fish. Res. Board Can. , 36:742-752.
Discussion of the need for economic rationalization has led to
increasing interest in alternative strategies to control fishing effort in
efficient ways.  Three basic alternatives are considered: taxation, control of
fishing inputs (""limited entry""), and direct limitation of output through
individual fisherman quotas.  Each is analyzed in terms of specified elements
of economic efficiency, distribution effects, freedom to choose fishing
methods and strategies, and administrative feasibility.  It is noted that in
practice all would be used in combination with other direct measures to assure
flexible control over fishing mortality.  A number of common objections to
economic rationalization of open access fisheries (e.g. creation of monopoly
power, unemployment, failure to reduce consumer prices, and nonmonetary values
associated with fishing) are analyzed and rejected as largely invalid.  While
the inherent short-term instability of commercial fishing and data problems
preclude any "" maximizing"" model of a rationalized fishery, the prospects for
workable programs leading to improved economic performance without adverse
societal impacts are excellent.

Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction on the New England Otter Trawl
Fleet.""  Draft Report, Department of Resource Economics,
University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI.
Prior to the enactment of the Fisheries Conservation and Management Act
of 1976, it was widely anticipated that extension of fisheries jurisdiction to
200 miles by the United States would result in substantial economic benefit to150the domestic fishing industry.  This paper examines the economic consequences
of extended jurisdiction on the New England otter trawl fleet.  The
traditional analyses of exploited fisheries show that in the absence of
controls on entry into the domestic fishery exclusion of foreign fleets will
only yield temporary economic surpluses as rents will eventually be dissipated
by additional domestic fishing effort.  Using a simulation program for this
fishery, revenues and costs for representative vessels from four major New
England ports from 1976 to 1982 are calculated, and net economic returns to
owners, captains, and crew are estimated.  For three of the four ports
considered, the estimated real economic surplus for the typical vessel peaked
in 1977-78 and declined dramatically through 1982.  While this result is
consistent with rent dissipation through overfishing, other factors indicate
that this decline in economic surplus may be due to exogenous factors.
Crutchfield, Stephen R. and John M. Gates (1985).  ""The Impact of
Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction on the New England Otter Trawl
Fleet.""  Marine Resource Economics , 2(2):153-173.
During the introduction of the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and
Management Act (MFCMA) of 1976 it was widely anticipated that extension of
fishery jurisdiction to 200 miles by the United States would result in
substantial economic benefits to the domestic fishing industry.  The
traditional analyses of exploited fisheries show that in the absence of
controls on entry into the domestic fishery, exclusion of foreign fleets will
only yield temporary economic rents which will eventually be dissipated by
additional domestic fishing effort.  This paper examines post-MFCMA trends for
the New England Otter Trawl fleet to determine the extent to which this
hypothesis holds.  By using a simulation program for this fishery, revenues
and costs for representative vessels from four major New England ports from
1976 to 1982 were calculated and factor rents to owners, captains, and crew
were estimated.  For three of the four ports considered, the estimated real
economic surplus for the typical vessel peaked in 1977-1978 and declined
dramatically through 1982.  While this finding indicates that some of the
potential rents from the fishery may have been dissipated by a substantial
increase in fleet size, other indicators show that this decline in economic
surplus may have been due to exogenous factors and not rent dissipation as
predicted by standard models.

The improvement of fishermen's income is one objective of fishery
management systems especially in developing countries.  Yet, it is difficult
to find cases where such an objective has been attained.  The purpose of this
paper is to consider the reasons for the widespread failure to achieve a
sustainable improvement in fishermen's incomes and to make policy proposals
designed to improve the changes of achieving this goal in the future.  The
conclusions reached seem likely to be especially relevant to developing
countries, but may also apply to developed countries with regions that are
dependent on fishing.
Cunningham, Stephen (1994).  ""Fishermen's Incomes and Fisheries
Management.""  Marine Resource Economics , 9(3):241-252.
The improvement of fishermen's income is often a central objective of
fisheries management programs, especially in developing countries.  This paper
considers the determinants of fishermen's incomes and discusses the way in
which different management methods may be expected to affect incomes.  Stress
is laid upon the difference between wealth and income.  It is argued that many
management measures are likely to have a significant effect on wealth but
little, if any, on income.  In designing management systems which have income
improvement as a goal, care needs therefore to be taken if a sustainable152improvement in incomes is to be achieved rather than a, perhaps unintended,
wealth redistribution.

Curtis, Rita (1997).   The Effect of Aggregation in Fishery Supply Models.  
Draft, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Maryland,
College Park, Maryland, August, 22 pp.
Three assumptions in fisheries economics may give rise to misleading
estimates of supply; aggregate fishing effort, single species analyses of
multispecies fisheries, and aggregating fishing days to the trip level.  This
paper focuses on the third assumption using Hawaii s multispecies pelagic
longline fishery as an empirical example.  Using a revenue function approach,
aggregation consistency is tested and rejected for all trip classifications. 
Hence a policy maker relying on results generated from the trip level model
would draw the erroneous conclusion that economic factors do not influence
production, that production is strictly biologically determined.
Curtis, Rita (1998).   The Effect of Temporal Aggregation in Fishery
Production Models.   Draft, Department of Agricultural Economics,
University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, August, 28 pp.
Aggregation theory is reviewed and the implications for fishery
economics is discussed.  This is followed by a characterization of
nonjointness in multispecies production and the relationship between
aggregation and input price nonjointness.  To further ground this discussion,
an empirical example using data from Hawaii s longline fishery is then
provided in the third section.  Temporal aggregation consistency is tested and
rejected for all three trip classifications.  Hence a policy maker relying on
results generated from the trip level model would draw the erroneous
conclusion that economic factors do not influence production, that production
is strictly biologically determined.  The importance of accurate supply
measures is demonstrated by comparing a hypothetical individual transferable
quotas program that might arise using results from the aggregated model
against an ITQ program based on disaggregate results.  Overall, the ITQ
program based on the aggregate model results in unnecessarily stringent catch
restrictions.

This paper examines the interactions between market structure and

The structures considered are a planned economy, pure monopoly, and
competition with patent rights.  In an efficient allocation the date of
invention coincides with the date of innovation (the date at which technology155is used).  This is also true with a pure monopoly, but monopoly retards
technical progress relative to the efficient level.  Competition for patents
rights to a new technology results in excessively rapid technical progress if
the resource endowment of the economy is sufficiently large.  Also,
competition may lead to sleeping patents, where invention strictly precedes
the date of innovation.

Water pollution is perceived by the general public to be of increasing

rather definite ideas about what constitutes a description of pollution.  The
respondents mentioned algae and murky, dark water but did not often mention
attributes such as chemicals or disease germs that are not detected by the
human sensory system.  When the respondents were asked to name water in the
state that they felt was polluted, they named waters that in fact have the
characteristics they described when defining pollution.  The most widely used
indicators of water pollution seem insufficient in light of the public
definition of, and concern about, water pollution.

Larval production and survival, equitable allocation and efficient
harvest among fishermen and maximization of yield per postlarval recruit are
identified as three major elements amenable to management actions in spiny
lobster fisheries.  Minimum harvestable lobster size, habitat protection and
enhancement, trap escape vents, and nursery sanctuaries are some of the means
of improving yield per postlarval recruit.
Davis, Gary E. (1989).  ""Designated Harvest Refugia: The Next Stage of
Marine Fishery Management in California.""  CalCOFI Rep. , 30:53-58.
Marine fishery management has traditionally been based on the biology
and population dynamics of individual target species.  Management controls are
generally exercised through limits on individual fish sizes, seasons of
harvest, catch limits, and restrictions on gear efficiency designed to protect
reproductive stocks.  Distance from port and depth provided de facto refugia
from harvest during the first century of modern exploitation, but recently few
California nearshore demersal fisheries have been able to sustain high yields
using traditional species specific management strategies.
Designated harvest refugia, or fisheries reserves, should now be156evaluated as management tools to enhance or sustain these coastal fisheries. 
In other parts of the world, designated harvest refugia provide recruits to
adjacent harvest zones, protect the genetic diversity of wild stocks, and
serve as experimental controls for determinations of potential yield.  This
concept could be adapted to California's coastal ecosystems by applying
accepted theories from ecology and conservation biology.  Hypotheses regarding
the optimum number, size, and distribution of fishery reserves in relation to
harvested zones should be empirically tested in existing marine parks and
reserves and in additional protected areas set aside especially for this
purpose.

Population Dynamics of Spiny Lobsters, Panulirus  Argus, in Florida Bay,
Everglades National Park, 1977-1980.   Bulletin of Marine Science ,
44(1):78-88.
Florida spiny lobsters, Panulirus  argus, occupied the southern two-
thirds of Florida Bay in Everglades National Park.  Field studies of 3,570
tagged lobsters revealed that they pass through Florida Bay, using it for less
than three years as juveniles, between their planktonic larval stages in the
open ocean and adulthood on coral reefs.  Lobsters from the bay support
commercial and recreational fisheries outside of Everglades National Park from
Dry Tortugas to Pacific Reef near Miami.  Growth rates of juvenile lobsters in
Florida Bay are the highest on record, which may be a reflection of optimum
habitat with abundant food and shelter.  Reportedly, the average-sized lobster
taken by commercial bully netters in the bay prior to 1965 was 90-95 mm
carapace length.  The park s recreational harvest in 1978-1979 was about
20,000 lobsters with a mean size of 83 mm CL, and about 44,000 lobsters (x 88
mm CL) in the 1979-1980 season.  The fishery also provided 7,500 to 8,000
person-days of recreation each year for about 1,000 persons.  In 1980, a
lobster nursery sanctuary was created in the Everglades National Park portion
of Florida Bay to restore the natural conditions of the bay and provide more
lobsters for harvest in adjacent fisheries.

or Replenishment Zones to Fisheries Management.   In Karyn L. Gimbel
(ed.) Limiting Access to Marine Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on
Conservation , Center for Marine Conservation and the World Wildlife
Fund, Washington, D.C.
Marine resources appear to be particularly vulnerable to the  tragedy of
the commons  wherein uncontrolled access to commonly owned renewable resources
results in the depletion of those resources.  Current fishery management
regimes based on single species that use maximum sustainable yields, size and
bag limits, seasonal closures, and limited entry approaches appear to offer
little hope for the restoration of impacted fisheries and marine ecosystems. 
New approaches are critically needed.  Marine fishery refugia, areas unaltered
by harvest that serve as sources of replenishment, offer hope for the
restoration and stabilization of yields for coastal marine fisheries and
communities.  Although most reserves were not designed for fishery management
purposes, our review of studies of these small unharvested areas indicate that
increases in the abundance, individual size and reproductive potential of
target species, and increases in species diversity occurred withing reserves
of various sizes, shapes, and histories in marine communities ranging from
coral reefs to kelp forests.  In a few cases, yields were higher in areas
surrounding the reserves.  Our preliminary results indicate that fishery
refugia should be further examined as a management option, particularly for
long lived coastal species.157Day, Susan Virginia (1988).  ""Estimating the Non-Consumptive Use Value

This investigation studied the biological and economic aspects of the
fishery in relation to the shrimping areas involved, the species of shrimp
caught, fishery methods and gear, catch composition ecology of the shrimp
area, effects of certain gear on the ecology of shrimp areas, especially
pushnets, statistics and economics of the fishery, and methods of holding and
transporting live shrimp.  During this three month study from June to August,
1953, 47 fishermen and dealers were interviewed and field studies were
conducted to collect and observe the fishing methods.

Journal of Environmental Economics and Management , 16:167-183.
The multiple-cohort approach to population dynamics is seldom used for
empirical analysis of catch and effort data due to the complexity of the
resulting models and to limitations on available data.  The present paper
addresses these problems by adopting a discrete time framework and simplifying
assumptions for growth, mortality, and recruitment.  The result is a readily
estimated econometric model of the commercial catch that is consistent with
the multiple-cohort paradigm.  This model is applied to catch and effort data
for the California abalone fishery and the estimates obtained are used to
analyze policy.

System.""  American Economic Review , 70(3):312-326.
A new model is proposed and estimated that is of comparable generality
to the Rotterdam and translog models but that has considerable advantages over
both.  This model, called the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), gives an
arbitrary first-order approximation to any demand system; it satisfies the
axioms of choice exactly; it aggregates perfectly over consumers without
invoking parallel linear Engel curves; it has a functional form that is
consistent with known household budget data; it is simple to estimate, largely
avoiding the need for nonlinear estimation; and it can be used to test the
restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry through linear restrictions on fixed
parameters.  Although many of these desirable properties are possessed by one
or other of the Rotterdam or translog models, neither possesses all of them
simultaneously.

Catfish are a major aquacultural species in the United States.  As
production expands through increased acreage and improved production
practices, additional knowledge of market opportunities for catfish is needed
to direct further expansion of the industry.  This study analyzes the socio-
economic characteristics associated with home consumption of catfish.  Data
were obtained through a questionnaire mailed to residents in seven
metropolitan areas in 1986.  A logit analysis, that determines the
relationship between family size, race, income, occupational status, and
location of the household, and the probability of catfish consumption was
conducted.  Results of the analysis indicate that family size, family income,
and occupational status of the household head positively influence the
probability of at home catfish consumption.,  Presence of children in the
household was a characteristic found to reduce the probability of household
catfish consumption.

The results of this project strongly support the feasibility of
measuring the recreation and related benefits of water quality improvements. 
Moreover, the benefits measurement approaches - several contingent valuation
formats and the travel cost method - show consistent results for comparable
changes in water quality.  Indeed, the range of variation is generally less
than that expected in models used to translate the effects of effluents in a
water body into the corresponding water quality parameters.  In addition, the
results also clearly show that the intrinsic benefits of water quality
improvements, especially option values, can be measured and that they are a
sizable portion (greater than half) of the total recreation and related
benefits total.

A world sugar model consisting of 21 countries was developed to
determine the effects of NAFTA on U.S. and Mexican sugar markets and to
quantify the trade creation and diversion effects on U.S. imports from Mexico. 
Mexican sugar production increases under NAFTA, causing Mexico to become a net
exporter.  NAFTA induces sugar imports from Mexico to displace U.S.
production, to meet demand expansion, and also to divert U.S. imports from
other foreign suppliers to Mexico.  Effects of NAFTA on the U.S. sugar market
are small because of the side agreements which limit Mexican exports and which
include corn sweetener consumption when computing Mexico s production surplus.

Rents: A Partial Review of the Report of the Commission on Canadian
Pacific Fisheries Policy.   Marine Resource Economics , 4(1):347-367.161The Canadian Pacific fisheries currently suffer from excess harvesting
capacity.  A recent Royal Commission has recommended a joint scheme of
royalties on the catch and a novel license auction plan to alleviate the
problem.  This paper investigates the impact of these two policies.  First,
the total royalty revenue is measured and then the royalty incidence across
fishermen, processors, and consumers is estimated.  Next, we analyze the
license auction scheme to calculate the costs of these two policies.  First,
the total royalty revenue is measured and then the royalty incidence across
fishermen, processors, and consumers is estimated.  Next, we analyze the
license auction scheme to calculate the costs of purchasing the licenses to
the fishermen and the net costs of purchasing the licenses to the fishermen
and the net proceeds to the government after the retirement of one-half the
fleet under alternative possible selling strategies of fishermen.  We conclude
that the royalty scheme would finance the retirement of the fleet in 13 years
and that the incidence of the royalty would vary greatly across species/gear
type.  The license auction scheme, in contrast, is a potent policy measure
which under several scenarios could fully fund the buy-back program and
contribute significantly to public revenue.

Individual Transferable Quotas in New Zealand s Inshore Fishery.   North
American Journal of Fisheries Management , 9(2):131-139.
In 1986, New Zealand implemented an individual transferable quota system
(ITQ) for selected inshore fish species to promote conservation of stocks and
to improve the economic efficiency of the fishing industry.  The objectives of
this study were to assess perceived problems and benefits of this new system
and its effect on the fishing industry.  Data were obtained through interviews
with 62 industry participants from the Auckland region and 14 Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries staff.  Over 75% of the fishermen were making
significant changes in their business because of ITQs.  These changes included 
minimization of costs and maximization of price received for their catch,
practices consistent with economic theory about ITQs.  Industry and management
agency interviewees generally recognized ITQ benefits of reduced competition,
resource conservation, increased retirement security, reduced economic risk,
possession of a valuable asset, improved ability to plan, and the
professionalization of fishing.  Problems with the system included discarding
of catches not included in an individual s quota, discarding of the lower
priced portion of catches of some species, enforcement, accuracy of total
allowable catch quotas, quota aggregation by companies, and high cost to
youths interested in entering the fishery.  After 6 months under ITQs, 56% of
the fishermen and 100% of the agency staff interviewed felt this new system of
managing fisheries would be successful.

The adoption/nonadoption of technical innovations was examined in the
Pacific Coast Trawl fishery using a model based on recent conceptual issues
raised in the innovation diffusion literature.  Included in the model were
variables measuring each fisherman s personal characteristics and situation,
attitudes about fishing, and perceptions of each innovation s characteristics. 
Data were collected in 83 personal interviews during spring 1984, a period of
economic crisis in the fleet.  The results indicate that a different subset of
independent variables explained the adoption of each innovation.  This appears
to be due to the innovation-by-innovation differences in the match between the
potential adopter and the innovation.  The effect of variables on162adoption/nonadoption varied across innovations.  The characteristics of
potential adopters and the characteristics of the innovations, as perceived by
the potential adopters, were both important determinants of
adoption/nonadoption.

Many communities face a waste management crisis.  An increase in waste
generation and decline in available landfill capacity have led to rapid
increases in waste management costs.  Using sewage sludge management in
coastal New York and New Jersey as an example, this paper examines optimal
multimedia waste disposal under cost uncertainty.  Using expected value
variance analysis, the study looks at the effects on the optimal disposal
strategy of uncertainty associated with waste management cost and the
community s risk preferences.  The results indicate that, based on available
cost data, the optimal strategy of a moderately risk averse decision maker is
to manage sludge through land based facilities.  These results hold over a
wide range of risk aversion parameters and even at low levels of cost
uncertainty.  Thus, the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 is consistent with such
results.

Recent changes in the U.S. liability regime for oil pollution damage are
precipitating a potential insurance crisis for oil carriers operating in U.S.

industry to internalize the costs of oil pollution, unlimited liability
combined with uncertainty in damage valuation can result in great costs to
society, including the possible disruption of oil supplies.  We formulate a
model to determine an optimal level of risk-sharing for oil pollution damage
between the public and the foreign tanker industry, and show how a socially
optimal limit to liability can be determined.

Factor Productivity Change in New England Fisheries: 1964-1993.  Draft
Report, Marine Policy Center, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
Woods Hole, February, 42 pp.
New England fisheries have experienced dramatic changes in management
institutions and instruments during the past 30 years.  The recent collapse of
several important commercial fish stocks has heightened public debate over
fisheries management.  We develop estimates of total factor productivity (TFP)
change in New England fisheries form 1964 to 1993, suing a procedure similar
to Squires  (1992) method, which extends standard TFP measurement by including
the effect of fluctuations in open access fish stocks.  The results indicate
that TFP increased on average by 4.8 percent per year from 1964 to 1993.  A
higher average rate of increase was achieved from 1964 to 1983, possibly due
to new technologies (e.g., fish finders).  TFP declined at 0.12 percent
annually from 1984 to 1993, due to str4ingent output and effort control
measures.  A healthy level of resource stocks is a preconditi8on for sustained
productivity growth in the fishing industry.  Failure to consider the stock
factor in an open access resource industry can cause policies intended to
promote productivity growth to drive the stock to extinction.  To achieve
productivity growth while maintaining a sustainable stock level, it si
necessary to reduce fleet size.163Diaby, Souleymane (1996).   Economic Impact Analysis of the Ivorian Sardinella
Fishery.   Marine Resource Economics , 11(1): 31-42.
A bioeconomic simulation model of the Ivorian sardinella fishery is
developed to identify and quantify welfare effects stemming from resource
exploitation controlled by a fishermen s monopoly.  The biological and
economic components are modeled to include multicohorts and multispecies, the
demand facing the industrial sector, and a heterogeneous fishing fleet under
exploitation conditions with and without cycles.  A profit maximization
scenario indicates that management of the fishery under the current fleet
structure is not socially optimal.  The analysis is extended to include the
competition from an expanding artisanal sector of the fishery.  Any changes in
public policies leading to the expansion of the artisanal fishery would result
in increases in consumer benefits from the fishery, while the benefits to the
syndicate decrease.
Diamond, Peter A. and Jerry A. Hausman (1994).  ""Contingent Valuation:
Is Some Number Better than No Number.""  Journal of Economic
Perspectives , 8(4):45-64.
The evidence supports the conclusion that to date, contingent valuation
surveys do not measure the preferences they attempt to measure.  Moreover,
reasons are present for thinking that changes in survey methods are not likely
to change this conclusion.  Viewed alternatively as opinion polls on possible
government actions, these surveys do not have much information to contribute
to informed policy  making.  Thus, reliance on contingent valuation surveys in
either damage assessments or in government decision making is basically
misguided.

Descriptions of fisheries systems for purposes of management often seem
to imply a naturally predetermined biological structure and functioning of the
resource.  However, such basic characteristics as stock definition, species
composition, levels of production, and biological efficiency are parameters
that have generally been adapted to suit particular fishery conditions and in
any case are variables that interact with both environment and the nature of
industrial exploitation.  In the interests of economic or social analyses in
fisheries these biological descriptors should normally be amenable to
redefinition or redescription without prejudice to their reliability as
indices of natural production.164Dietz, Elizabeth (1994). ""Measuring Employee Bonuses: A Review of Test

Economics , 11(2):71-84.
If the technology in a multispecies fishery is such that there is
jointness in inputs and nonseparability between inputs and outputs, then
management on a species by species basis may lead to unintended outcomes,
including over exploitation of the resource.  This study investigates the
nature of the technical and economic relationships underlying the 1989-90
Mauritanian cephalopod fishery by estimating a system of dual output supply
functions derived from a generalized Leontief revenue function.  Model results
indicate the existence of jointness in inputs and nonseparability between
inputs and outputs in the fishery.  Cross price elasticities indicated a
number of substitute and complementary relationships, with these relationships
changing in magnitude across years.  Taken together, the results suggest that
any attempts to economically manage the resource should be based on
multiproduct production theory, not single species biological response
functions.  Besides ruling out single species management, the dominance of
substitute relationships in the Mauritanian cephalopod fishery precludes the
use of  key species  management of the entire resource.

A review of the New England fish processing industry since the

imports have replaced domestic production.  With the collapse of Canadian
stocks, processing firms in New England have begun to exit the industry. 
Along with this concentration, larger, more diversified firms are dominating
the processing industry as smaller firms are forced to exit.  Lower priced

due to the groundfish shortage problem.

How people perceive Green Bay as a recreation resource, how perceptions

patterns, are identified.  Whereas seven of ten household heads interviewed
participated in boating, or swimming, only three of the ten used Green bay
during the preceding 12 months, indicating that Green Bay was not a focal
point of water based recreation among residents of the five county study area. 
Chi square test groups differed significantly on most comparisons when used to
describe the Bay and its most bothersome physical and water quality
characteristics.  Generally, participants and those who use the Bay were less
apt to cite unpleasant smell and dead fish as major problems and more apt to
cite such problems as winds, waves, and cloudiness.  Comparisons between three
user groups (fishermen, boaters, and swimmers) indicated swimmers and boaters
differed most in their perception of the Bay and its troublesome
characteristics, with fishermen occupying a position between the two groups.

Published and unpublished research findings regarding charter and
headboat fishing customers from 11 studies were reviewed to provide a
marketing data base for operators and to guide further research efforts. 
Generally charter/headboat fishing is a male-oriented activity.  Customers
were between 30 and 55 years of age.  Although both groups of anglers
considered themselves to be experienced, charter boat anglers had fished for
more years.  Charter anglers fished more often with their families and
headboat anglers more often with their friends.  Charter boat anglers reported
higher incomes than headboat anglers.  Relaxation, having fun, and escaping
from daily pressures were generally more important to both groups of anglers
than motives relative to catching fish.  Most anglers indicated that the
skills and performance of the captain and crew contributed heavily to the
overall evaluation of their fishing experience.  Anglers were more heavily
influenced to choose a particular captain or boat by informal advertising
methods (i.e. word of mouth recommendations, reputation, and visits to the
marina) than formal methods (i.e. advertisements, brochures, ratio, and
television).  Charter anglers relied more on word-of-mouth recommendations and
headboat customers were more influenced by previous experiences.  Implications
for further research are discussed.

A firm's entry and exit decisions when the output price follows a random
walk are examined.  An idle firm and an active firm are viewed as assets that
are call options on each other.  The solution is a pair of trigger prices for168entry and exit.  The entry trigger exceeds the variable cost plus the interest
on the entry cost, and the exit trigger is less than the variable cost minus
the interest on the exit cost.  These gaps produce ""hysteresis.""  Numerical
solutions are obtained for several parameter values; hysteresis is found to be
significant even with small sunk costs.

The aim of this paper is to begin analysis of the functioning of

important to recognize that the strategies of governments interact with those

mydas, in Florida - A Hopeful Trend?""  Office of Endangered
Species, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C.
Except for accounts of Audubon and Brice in the 1800's, reliable records
of the nesting of the green turtle do not occur in the literature.  Even these
accounts focus on populations in the Keys and the Cape Sable region. 
Beginning with the report of two nests prior to 1959, the number of nests
recorded in Florida has steadily increased; at least 366 nests were confirmed
in 1980.  The majority of nests occurred from Merritt Island south to Key
Biscayne, most of which were laid on relatively undisturbed beaches.  Five
reasons can be advanced for this apparent increase: increased surveillance of
nesting beaches, increased awareness of sea turtles and their problems,
protective legislation, the success of a head starting program located on
Hutchinson Island, and the possibility that some turtles are immigrating from
populations further south.  While better surveillance and public awareness may
be responsible for perception of an increasing turtle population, it is likely
that the increase is real and has resulted form a combination of the latter
three reasons.  A review of the level of historical green turtle nesting, as
well as a year by year record of nesting since 1959, is provided.

A five equation demand model of the U.S. shrimp market was estimated
using annual data for the period from 1950 to 1968.  Prices, consumption, and
ending stocks were the jointly determined variables; predetermined variables
were shrimp supplies and consumer income.  Ex-vessel price variations resulted
largely from variations in domestic landings.  Imports reduced the general
level of ex-vessel prices but did not contribute substantially to price
variability except in isolated instances.  Large price drops occurred during
periods of recession when increases in demand were slowed and stocks began to
build, while landings and imports increased substantially over the previous
year.

This paper provides an overview of the emerging ""Superfund"" natural
resource damage assessment and compensation framework and a review of several
economic and legal issues that are likely to affect the ability of the
framework to achieve its objectives.  The Superfund Act as amended establishes
a federal regulatory structure that provides a legal ""legitimization"" for the
use of economic based nonmarket valuation techniques in judicial proceedings
involving natural resource injuries resulting from oil and hazardous waste171spills and releases.  While the regulations have the potential to foster more
appropriate compensation as well as prospective incentives to limit damages to
natural resources, several controversial elements, definitions, and
assumptions built into the damage assessment regulations appear to have the
potential to undermine the efficiency and equity of damage assessments.  These
issues reflect the difficulty of integrating economic concepts of natural
resource value and their estimation into the legal environment.

The oyster industry, which encompasses 18 of the 21 coastal states, has
the broadest geographical distribution in the seafood industry.  It is the
economic focus of many rural coastal communities and provides direct
employment for watermen and plant processing personnel in addition to
supporting numerous marine-related businesses.  The amount of formal
integration between the harvesting, processing, and marketing sectors of the
industry is limited.  However, vertical integration is found in large
processing operations that obtain supply  through aquaculture and from private
oyster grounds.

Allowing for the biological and economic complexities pertaining to a
particular fishery requires a phased, hierarchical approach to fishery
management.  Mathematical programming models, particularly goal programs are
applicable to this type of management problem because they can readily
accommodate the constraints and targets set in previous phases as well as any
new ones that may be required.  There are a number of goal programming
formulations that may be useful for modeling the objectives of fishery
management problems.  Furthermore, economic objectives can be interpreted in
different ways.  The purpose of this paper is to illustrate a range of goal
programming specifications into which alternative economic objectives have
been incorporated.

total fixed costs, and net revenue by vessel size.  Other data gathered
included information on marketing channels, and subjective appraisals of the
problems confronted by recreational and commercial shrimpers.  Although much

Coastal Fisheries Management.   Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. , 50:2029-2042.
Marine fisheries refugia, unaltered areas that serve as sources of
replenishment, can potentially compensate for recruitment and ecosystem over
fishing and enhance fishery yields for some coastal stocks.  The efficacy of
Refugia in fisheries management is virtually untested, despite the existence
of many marine parks and reserves.  Evidence from existing marine reserves
indicates that increased abundance, individual size, reproductive output, and
species diversity occurred in a variety of marine species in refuges of
various sizes, shapes, and histories in communities ranging from coral reefs
to temperate kelp forests.  Fishery yield enhancement in areas surrounding
refuges occurred in the few studies where yields were examined.  The export of
propagules required to enhance fisheries in areas surrounding refugia adds a
level of complexity to the design of fishery refugia beyond that of
terrestrial reserves.  Fishery refugia design should consider species life
fisheries, oceanographic regimes, habitat quality, and socioeconomic factors. 
Further evaluation of existing marine refuges and the investigation of
experimental refugia over appropriate time spans will help resolve questions
of optimal sizes, shapes, and distribution of fishery refugia.

The 1992 increase was the lowest since 1967, when the index rose 0.9 percent.

increase.  The prices farmers received for commodities, as measured by the
farm value of USDA s market basket of foods, declined 2.5 percent.  The farm
value share of the food dollar spent in grocery stores in 1992 was 26 percent,
down from 27 percent in 1991.  The farm-to-retail price spread of USDA s
market basket of foods rose 2 percent, partly reflecting higher prices of
inputs, such as labor.173Dunn, James W. and James S. Shortle (1988).  ""Agricultural Nonpoint

The theory of efficient policy instruments for agricultural pollution
control has been evolving.  Some new developments suggest that policies using
financial incentives to encourage desirable farming practices are superior to
those focusing on runoff directly or restrictions of farming practices. 
However, the theoretical models used to derive such results make assumptions
about conditions that may not hold.  As a result, implementation of the
findings of such models is not necessarily routine.  This article attempts to
summarize these studies and interpret their implications for agricultural
nonpoint source pollution control for the Chesapeake Bay.

The paper presents a short run model of a fishing firm in a limited
entry fishery subject to vessel level input restrictions.  Cross sectional
data from the British Columbia commercial salmon fishery are used to test for
the presence of input substitutability.  Inferences may then be made about the
ability of the fisherman to dissipate rent from the fishery.  The choice of
this fishery is appropriate, since it was one of the first to adopt limited
entry licensing to combat the problems generated by years of open access
fishing.
Dupont, D.P. (1990).  ""Rent Dissipation in Restricted Access Fisheries."" 
Journal of Environmental Economics and Management , 19:26-44.
Restricted access fisheries, created to solve the open access problem of
rent dissipation, have not been successful.  Three common sources of
dissipated rent are input substitution, fleet redundancy, and fleet
composition.  Regulators on the west coast of Canada have focused on finding
solutions for the first source.  This paper questions the wisdom of past
policy by developing and implementing a method for measuring rent dissipation
in restricted access fisheries.  Results from the British Columbia salmon
fishery suggest that regulators should concentrate instead on improving fleet
composition and removing excess vessels.
Dupont, D.P. (1991).  ""Testing for Input Substitution in a Regulated
Fisheries.""  American Journal Agricultural Economics , February,
155-164.
Input restrictions are commonly used to prevent rent dissipation in
fisheries.  This paper examines whether these schemes are successful by
calculation the degree of input substitution between restricted and
unrestricted inputs.  Conventional elasticities of substitution cannot be used
when the firm faces controls on the use of some inputs.  In this case, the
appropriate measure of substitution, the elasticity of intensity, must be
used.  Data from the British Columbia salmon fishery provide evidence of input
substitution possibilities for two vessel types.  These results call into
question the usefulness of input control schemes.

This paper deals with the effects of uncertain output prices upon174fishers' location choices.  It employs ARIMA models to construct the price
forecasts used by fishers in a model that generates expected profits for three
fishing locations in the British Columbia salmon fishery.  A random utility
model of fishing location choice is then estimated using two different sets of
regressors.  The first is expected seasonal profit and its variability.  The
second is expected wealth and its variability, where expected wealth is taken
to be the sum of the known preseason wealth and the expected profitability of
a given fishing location.  Results show that expected profitability is a
significant determinant of fishing location choice but that expected wealth
plays an even bigger role.  This suggests that there is a type of income or
stock effect present in decisions made by fishers.  The results also provide
evidence that the variability of profits or wealth is generally a less
significant component in regard to fishing location choice.  In fact, some
fishers thrive on greater variability, thereby providing some evidence of the
risk loving behavior typically attributed to fishers.  This is not the case,
however, for all fishers since some are found to be risk neutral and even risk
averse.

policy implication concerns the ability of fisheries managers to alter the
dispersion of fishers over fishing locations via the adjustment of the
economic incentives by means of differential royalty taxes.  A second policy
implication results from the finding of risk loving behavior.  This calls into
question models that assume risk averse behavior and predict a dominance of
corp sharing contracts over wage contracts.

An empirical methodology for evaluating fisheries regulations in terms

change in catch distribution among competing vessel types are compared with
the status quo of restricted access.  The case study is the British Columbia

the alternatives are not always sufficient to compensate for losses in fishing
income.175Dybas, Cheryl Lyn (1997).   Appetite for Slow-Reproducing Fish Breeds Worry

Fishermen.""  Forthcoming: Marine Anthropological Studies .
This article examines how shrimp fishermen in two communities on the
Gulf of Mexico have responded to federal regulations requiring the use of
Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) on shrimp trawlers.  Coming at a time of
contraction in the fishery due to low producer prices and high operating
costs, TED regulations have engendered intense opposition in many areas. 
Resistance to TEDs stems from shrimpers' perception that the regulations are
an unjust threat to their livelihoods.  Such beliefs are not unlike those
underlying other spontaneous resistance movements, such as agrarian uprisings
of the poor and dispossessed.  Recommendations for alternatives are made that
would provide incentives for conservation while lessening the economic
hardship of shrimpers and their families.

Circle, Suite 306, Charleston, South Carolina 29407-4699.
This report summarizes recent price trends in the swordfish and related
fisheries.  While selected tuna prices have increased recently, deflated
regional average prices, and relative prices, do not show the spectacular
changes that conventional wisdom leads us to believe.  This is not to dispute
recent prices offered, for example, for bluefin, but suggests that quantities
are still (through 1987) sufficiently small that average real prices and
relative prices show something less than spectacular movement.
Based on revenue profiles, tuna are obviously important to the longline
fishery, particularly in the Gulf region and the NEUS region.  Bigeye and
yellowfin may be increasingly important in explaining revenue in the CARB
region, based on 1986-1987 changes.  Additional years' revenue profiles will
allow tracking the share of various species in longline trip revenue.

This paper examines selected issues that are likely to be important in
improving economists' models of allocation of fishery harvests between
commercial and recreational harvesters.  Valuation in the commercial sector is
emphasized with harvests of a species subject to allocation viewed as an input
into production of consumer fishery goods.  Substitution possibilities in
production of these consumer goods, and data generally available to economists
are discussed as motivations for application of the general equilibrium
derived demand to valuation in the commercial sector.  Conceptual and
empirical problems in applying the function are discussed.

This paper focuses on multimarket welfare analysis in markets other than

multimarket derived demand surplus analysis.  The derived demand conceptual
framework was developed by Hicks (1963) and by Diewert (1971).  The Welfare
significance of general equilibrium surplus areas was established by Just,
Hueth, and Schmitz (1982).  The analytical base for measurement of welfare
effects in horizontally related markets (e.g. species other than the one being
subjected to reduced harvests, and which substitute in production for the
given species), and an early application to a fishery are discussed in Thurman
and Easley (1992).  The next section briefly sketches out the conceptual
framework for estimating multimarket effects in a single market (e.g., the
vessel level).  Following this conceptual section, we present results from
applying the GE derived demand model to the North Carolina flounder fishery.

This project has reviewed the fishery economics literature relevant to

exploration into many of the issues that will have to be addressed in
developing a derived-demand based model for allocation of commercial and
recreational harvests.  At this point, we are optimistic that such a model can
in fact be developed as a guide to economists and managers; however, much
remains to be modeled and refined before an allocation model can be applied.

Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics , 18(2):140-148.
This paper explores how hedonic price analysis might be used to estimate
the surplus benefits of local outdoor recreation when distance to the
recreational site is captured in property values.  The model is characterized
by the endogenous choice of distance to a local recreational area by
households in coastal property markets and by the capitalization of proximity
in property values.  Equilibrium occurs when the reduction in the cost of a
property due to a marginal increase in distance to the recreational area
equals the associated loss in recreational surplus resulting from increased
travel costs.  The theoretical model is applied in an exploratory analysis of
the ""demand"" for distance to the nearest public beach from which total surplus
benefits are estimated.

that preferences for seafood strengthened in response to medical evidence that
seafood promotes nutrition and health.  The graphical analyses revealed steady
increases in per capita consumption of seafood since the 1960's despite
concurrent increases in the price of seafood relative to income, to all foods,
and to the prices of other meats.  Also, the mid-1960's and mid-1980's
appeared to mark periods of accelerated change.  Two-phase regression analyses
of reduced form models of both per capita consumption and the price of seafood
quantified these apparent trends and identified points of accelerated change. 
Some implications of these results for specifying demand models, for
estimating consumer benefits, and for projecting fishing pressure on wild
stocks were highlighted.
Edwards, Steven F. (1990).  ""An Economics Guide to Allocation of Fish
Stocks Between Commercial and Recreational Fisheries.""  NOAA
Technical Report NMFS 94, Nov.
The increasingly intense competition between commercial and recreational
fishermen for access to fish stocks has focused attention on the economic
implications of fishery allocations.  Indeed, one can scarcely find a
management plan or amendment that does not at least refer to the relative food
and sport values of fish and to how expenditures by commercial and
recreational fishermen on equipment and supplies stimulate the economy. 
However, many of the arguments raised by constituents to influence such
allocations, while having an seemingly ""economics"" ring to them, are usually
incomplete, distorted, and even incorrect.  This report offers fishery
managers and other interested parties a guide to correct notions of economic
value and to the appropriate ways to characterize, estimate, and compare
value.  In particular, introductory material from benefit-cost analysis and
input-output analysis is described and illustrated.  In the process, several
familiar specious arguments are exposed.

Three familiar ""economics"" arguments commonly used by commercial
fishermen and anglers to influence fishery allocations are specious in the
context of fishery valuation.  The ""market argument"" and the ""revenues
argument"" are based on incorrect notions of economic value and are focused on
purely financial matters such as expenditures and revenues instead of on
consumer and producer surpluses.  In contrast, the ""cumulative-value argument""
sometimes addresses correct notions of economic value, but the values of
commercial and sport fisheries are not properly compared.  A conceptually
correct benefit-cost analysis of allocation between the two fisheries is
illustrated.

National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Fisheries Science
Center, Woods Hole, MA, October.
The paper discusses whether ITQs are a resource right or a usufructuary
or harvest right.  As a harvest right, the ITQ holder does not have the
ability to set TAC and may still have incentives to act inefficiently;
highgrading of catch.  ITQ may, however, be a step toward resource rights
since New Zealand ITQ holders have appropriated management rights from the
government by agreeing to harvest less than the TAC, enforce rules, and fund
research in the orange roughy and abalone fisheries.
Edwards, Steven F. (1994).   Managing Marine Fisheries by Controlled Access:
What Alternatives are Available?   In Karyn L. Gimbel (ed.) Limiting
Access to Marine Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on Conservation , Center
for Marine Conservation and the World Wildlife Fund, Washington, D.C.
Alternatives to control (or limit) access to marine fish resources are
classified on the basis of who owns the legal right of exclusion.  Throughout
the world, participation in some marine fisheries is controlled by the state
through allocation of usufructuary rights of access or harvest.  License
limitation, individual transferable quotas, and area licensing are forms of
usufructuary rights controlled by state regulatory regimes.
Unappreciated, though, are many instances of participation being
controlled by collectives of individual harvesters.  In collective choice
regimes, commercial fishermen and others with interests in a marine fish
resource contract access as well as usufructuary rights.
Finally, private property regimes also control access to marine fish
resources.  In this alternative, participation is authorized by a single,
private entity.  The entity could be a commercial fishing or fish processing
corporation, a charter fishing enterprise, or conceivably, a conservation
organization, depending on the initial allocation of rights and the
opportunity to market the rights.
In addition to controlling access, the right to exclude people from a
fish resource strongly favors both conservation and economic efficiency,
especially when exclusion is coupled with the rights of management and market
transfer and when rights are backed by the state.  Judging from theory and
case studies, usufructuary rights alone have yielded limited conservation and
economic benefits from use of fish and other natural resources under a state
regulatory regime.  However, usufructuary rights are widely believed to be
superior to open access, and they are a necessary phase in the evolution of
potentially better collective choice or private property regimes.
Edwards, Steven F. (1994).  ""Ownership of Renewable Ocean Resources."" 
Marine Resource Economics , 9(3):253-273.
Much of the recent fisheries economics literature promotes usufructuary
rights policies to lessen the dissipation of resource rents.  However, this
literature does not count institutional inefficiencies which result from rent
seeking and the principal agent problem when a centralized government controls
access to renewable ocean resources.  As a result, the efficiency of
usufructuary rights programs, including ITQs, throughout the economy could be
exaggerated.  From a dynamic standpoint, though, usufructuary rights policies
remain an important avenue for residual claimants to contract for less
attenuated institutions of common or private property rights.  These
conclusions are drawn from a survey of the property rights and public choice
literatures.
Edwards, Steven F. (1998).  ""Rent-Seeking in the U.S. Atlantic Sea182Scallop Fishery.""  Draft report, Northeast Fisheries Science
Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, Woods Hole, MA,
October, 25 pp.
Two phases of rent-seeking in the U.S. Atlantic sea scallop fishery are
described.  The phase that began when the Magnuson-Stevens Act was implemented
in 1977 and lasted over 10 years saw harvesters overcapitalize the fishery to
capture residual rents in the public domain.  Rents were apparently dissipated
within approximately three years after which the marginal revenue product of
effort remained below the marginal cost of effort given resource abundance
each year.  Resource depletion and high fixed costs led to negative average
vessel (accounting) profit during the mid-1980's and throughout the 1990's
due, in part, to non-transferable effort quotas and closed areas beginning in
1994.  Despite these dire financial circumstances, however, efforts to develop
property rights in the fishery beginning during the late 1980's have been
stymied by heterogeneities among fishermen, especially the potential
distribution of rents if effort quotas that were implemented by Amendment 4 to
the New England Fishery Management Council s Sea Scallop Fishery management
Plan became transferrable.  Estimates of ownership of effort quotas indicate
that 75 percent of the sea scallopers own one or fewer full-time-equivalent
permits compared to 5-10 permits owned by 4 percent of the quota holders.  The
paper concludes with a discussion of future prospects in the fishery related
to exclusive areas and sea scallop culture.

The implicit price (hedonic) equation for the housing market in a

Cox maximum likelihood procedure.  Linear, log-linear, and semi-log functional
forms were rejected with 95% confidence.  Estimates of marginal implicit
prices for water related attributes (view of, frontage on, and proximity to a
coastal salt water pond) derived from these rejected models were quite
different from those determined from the optimal functional form.  This result
has important ramifications for public policy, as is shown in an example,
since these attributes were found to be highly valued in the housing market.

Compensation for Injury to Publicly Owned Marine Resources.""

The public has an established right to use certain marine resources
including fish stocks, beaches, and marine waters, for certain purposes,
including recreational fishing.  Rights in public resources are held in trust
by federal and state governments for the public, both now and in the future. 
Given public rights, we not only argue that minimum willingness-to-accept-
compensation (WTA) is the theoretically correct measure of economic damages
when a publicly owned marine resource is injured, but that it is, in fact,
feasible to measure WTA and therefore, WTA should be used to estimate
compensation. Two utility theoretic approaches for welfare analysis, that use
Hausman's (1981) method and the contingent valuation method, are outlined.

distance from the nearest public beach on coastal property values was used to
reveal recreational value.  Estimates of recreational value were also compared
to the costs of beach nourishment that were calculated from a simulation of
beach erosion caused, in part, by increases in relative sea-level.  Although a
complete benefit-cost analysis was not feasible, the results suggest that
potential losses of recreational value by local users alone could establish
the efficiency of beach nourishment projects.

Benefits from Efficient Harvest of New England Groundfish.   North
American Journal of Fisheries Management , 13: 437-449.
Dissipation of economic benefits from commercial harvest of the
multispecies groundfish resource in U.S. waters off New England was estimated
from dynamic optimization of empirical bioeconomic models.  Net economic value
could be maximized by an estimate 70% reduction in fishing effort, resulting
in a sevenfold increase in the size of the harvestable resource and a
threefold increase in sustainable yield.  Under these conditions, fishers,
seafood industries, and consumers could benefit from an estimated US$150
million increase in sustainable net economic value each year, including about
$130 million in resource rent.  Consumers in the region could profit further
from the nutritional and health benefits of up to an additional 6 lb of fresh
fish per capita.  Policies to achieve these benefits are highlighted. 
Augmenting state ownership of the resource with market transfers of individual
effort or harvest quotas is preferred to open access, but common property or
individual private property regimes are more likely to benefit society.

Draft report prepared by the Northeast Fisheries Center Research
Council, September 5.
This report explores the meaning and application of sole ownership of
living marine resources with the purpose of promoting an informed and timely
discussion of its utility and feasibility.  The major findings and conclusions
are: (1) fish resources are the only publicly owned natural resources in the
United States that are both widely subject to open access and available to
harvesters at no cost; (2) both overfishing and the resultant dissipation of
billions of dollars of resource value result from the absence of well defined
(i.e. permanent, enforceable, and transferable) property rights to the living
marine resources; (3)fishery quotas and effort restrictions address only the
symptoms of open access, not the fundamental problem of a lack of property
rights to the resource and its productivity; (4) the incentives that influence
decisions of fishermen and public officials are fundamental to the presence of
both ""market failure"" and ""government failure;"" (5) sole ownership--not
limited entry or ITQs--could provide resource owners with the necessary
incentives to husband the fish resources.

determines the natural mortality rate.  Under this hypothesis if one

recruitment, one will be able to determine the impact of fishing upon
recruitment because fishing can be considered as a controllable component of
the natural mortality rate.  Stated somewhat differently, the natural
mortality rate, set by the recruitment process, determines how much fishing a
resource can sustain.

The catching efficiency of a 12.5 meter standard shrimp trawl and the
same trawl fitted with three different electrode array systems with power on
and power off was investigated.  The standard trawl caught 1.54 times or 54.2%
more kilograms of fish than the electrode equipped trawl with power off.  The
electrode array hanging across the mouth area of the trawl acted as a visual
stimulant and thus reduced the trawl's catch rate.  Overall, the electrical
trawl with power on caught 1.19 times or 19.0% more kilograms of fish than the
electrical trawl with power off.  Array 2 with power on had the best catch
rate; 1.86 times or 86.9% more kilograms of fish than the power off catch
rate.  The avoidance of fish to an electrode array was more than offset with
the catch rate of array 2 with power on.  The dominance patterns of the
catches with each system tested did not change significantly with the
exception of chub catches with array 2 with power on.  Length selectivity was
highly significant for chubs caught with arrays 2 and 3 with power on.  No
significant length selectivity occurred with the other species landed.

in the second, was log normally distributed.  The bid approaches were those of
K.L. Boyle, M.P. Welsh, and R.C. Bishop (1988), J.C. Cooper (1993), and an ad

estimates from the three approaches were compared to the true value.  Results
indicated that Boyle et al. s approach was preferred, especially when
variation in WTP was low.  Estimates from the three approaches became more
comparable as WTP Variability and sample size increased.

This paper analyzes international trade in value added products when
free trade and perfect competition in the market for an intermediate product,186such as raw fish, are the exception rather than the rule.  The study presents
models showing that restrictions on the exportation of raw fish from an
exporting country can make possible monopsony behavior by fish processors in a
rival exporting country and they outline the market behavior of the players
under such circumstances.  The analysis illustrates how, under such
conditions, economic forces contribute to the creation of trade disputes.  It
further demonstrates how expansion of the demand for final product may,
through trade reversal pressures, dilute the market power of the processor
monopsony and make trade restriction policies irrelevant.

The effects of socio-demographic factors on consumer ratings of product

techniques were used to evaluate the effects of experience consuming other
canned fish products, race, gender, age, and income on the taste, texture,
appearance, and aroma of canned bighead.  A logit analysis was then used to
measure the effects of these variables on binary choice variables related to
preference comparisons and willingness to pay as much for canned bighead as
for canned salmon and canned tuna.  Responses between the comparisons of
canned bighead and canned salmon or canned tuna varied.  Income, region, and
gender significantly affected ratings on product attributes while taste
variables significantly affected consumers  willingness to pay as much for
canned bighead as for canned tuna.  Conditional probabilities showed more
clearly the effects of age, income, and gender on taste ratings, the
subsequent effects of taste on preferences, and ultimately on willingness to
pay.  Probabilities estimated showed that canned bighead competes more
favorably with canned tuna than with canned salmon. 187Engle, Carole R., Upton Hatch, and Scott M. Swinton (1988).  ""Factors

models is the construction of a travel cost variable.  This difficulty results
from the need to include travel costs as an explanatory variable when applying
conventional econometric procedures.  This paper approaches the problem from
the maintained hypothesis that travel costs are inherently unobservable.  The
research develops an econometric approach that views travel costs as an
unobserved latent variable.  The latent variable approach utilizes indicators
to capture the role of individual travel costs in recreational demand models. 
The latent variables approach has at least two advantages over conventional
approaches.  One, the indicators can include both traditional components such
as travel time and travel distance and nontraditional components such as the
scenic beauty of a trip.  Second, the estimation procedure results in each
indicator being valued in dollar terms.

Epperly, Sheryan P., Joanne Braun, Alexander J. Chester (1995).  ""Aerial
Surveys for Sea Turtles in North Carolina Inshore Waters."" 
Fishery Bulletin , 93:254-261.
Aerial surveys for sea turtles conducted in Core Sound and Pamlico
Sound, North Carolina, 1989-91 indicated a spring immigration by the turtles
into these sounds and a summer time dispersal followed by emigration in the
late fall and early winter.  Estimates of density in Core Sound were greater
than estimates for Pamlico Sound.  Core Sound density estimates were
comparable to those reported for the lower Chesapeake Bay and those reported
from offshore pelagic surveys in the region.  The data were analyzed by strip-
and line-transect methods, and the choice of analysis did not influence the
overall conclusions.  The abundance of sea turtles in the inshore waters of
the Atlantic Coast at densities at least as great as in the ocean indicates
the importance of these estuarine habitats for the foraging and development of
immature turtles.
Epperly, Sheryan P., Joanne Braun, and Allison Veishlow (1995).  ""Sea
Turtles in North Carolina Waters.""  Conservation Biology ,
9(2):384-394.
Until the turn of the century the inshore waters of North Carolina
harbored populations of sea turtles large enough to support a commercial
fishery.  Based on a 4 to 5 year record of sighting reports by the public,
interviews of recreational fishermen, and records kept by commercial
fishermen, the waters continue to provide important developmental habitats for
loggerhead, green, and Kemp's ridley sea turtles.  Leatherback and hawksbill
sea turtles infrequently entered the inshore waters.  Reports from the public
and commercial fishermen indicated that sea turtles were present offshore
North Carolina all year and were present in inshore waters April through
December.  Sea turtles were encountered most frequently in the Atlantic Ocean,
but seasonal encounters in some inshore waters, such as Core and Pamlico
Sounds, often were greater.  In early May large numbers of leatherbacks were
sighted in the ocean and moved northward along the beach.  Reported sighting
of leatherbacks declined markedly by late June.  Based on incidental captures
by commercial fishermen loggerhead turtles were the most numerous species in
Pamlico and Core Sounds (80%), followed by green (15%) and Kemp's ridley sea
turtles (5%).  Most captured turtles were immature, and all were released
alive.  The abundance of immature sea turtles in North Carolina inshore waters
serves to emphasize that southeast U.S. estuaries are important habitats for
these threatened and endangered species.  This recognition supported the
decision of the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service to extend the
requirement for turtle excluder devices in shrimp trawls to inshore areas
during the entire year; full implementation of these requirements was achieved
by December 1994.

Rising mean sea level is a significant indicator of global climate
change.  The principal factors that can have contributed to the observed
increases of global mean sea level in recent decades are thermal expansion of
the oceans and the discharge of polar ice sheets.  Monitoring of global mean
sea level, ocean surface temperatures, and the earth's speed of rotation
should be complemented by monitoring of the polar ice sheets, as is now
possible by satellite telemetry.  All parts of the puzzle need to be examined
in order that a consistent picture emerge.

Fisheries development has been the subject of persistent debate in the
federal government.  Most of this debate centers on the appropriate federal
role in fisheries development.  The issue is complicated by the venerable
tradition of government intervention in industries other than fisheries.  The
debate is of interest to the recreational fishing community because, within
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a policy that the fishing industry is
composed of commercial and recreational segments and that our programs should
benefit both segments.

King mackerel (1,968) caught by hook and line off Grand Isle, Louisiana
were tagged with internal anchor tags and released between 1983 and 1985. 
Fifty five tags were recovered, providing an overall return rate of 2.8
percent.  King mackerel tagged in winter were returned in every month of the
year, but always from the Grand Isle area or westward as far as Veracruz,
Mexico.  All but one summer tagged fish were returned in winter months from
the Grand Isle area, Key West, Florida, or from Mexico.  Winter tagged fish
were mostly large and mostly remained in the northwest Gulf.  Summer tagged
fish tended to stay in the northwest Gulf if they were large, or migrated to
south Florida or Mexico if they were small.  The data indicate that the
northwest Gulf maintains resident large king mackerel year round, and that
these fish mix with smaller migrants from south Florida and Mexico to some191degree in warmer months.

A dual representation of a technology, e.g., a cost function, may not
contain all of the technological information, but it will contain all of the
information about input vectors that would be chosen by a cost minimizing
firm.  At least this much is clear for deterministic technologies.  The main
question addressed in this paper is whether the same can be said about
stochastic technologies and their dual representations.  Despite some
pessimism expressed in the stochastic frontier literature on this question, we
argue that there is no extra cost imposed in the stochastic case.  Thus, the
conclusion of this paper is: JUST DUAL IT!

Shephard (1970) see also Fare and Primont (1995), both primal and dual multi-
output measures of capacity can be derived.  Having generalized the capacity
utilization measures, we show how these may be entered into measures of
productivity.  In particular, following DeBorger and Kerstens (1999), we show
how the Malmquist direct and indirect productivity measures are related to our
various measures of capacity utilization efficiency.

modifications to the standard Farrell approach to efficiency measurement.  The
restriction that production technology satisfy strong disposability of outputs
is relaxed to allow for the fact the undesirable outputs may be freely
disposable, and the efficiency measures are modified to allow for an
asymmetric treatment of desirable and undesirable outputs.  Performance
measures that satisfy these requirements are calculated as solutions to
programming problems.  The methodology is applied to a sample of mills

originating from launch sites such as marina wet slips and boathouses at
private residences have not been surveyed and were not included in landings
and pressure estimates.  In 1982 a mail survey of boat owners registered in
Texas was conducted to estimate the percent of saltwater sportfishing boat
trips that were missed by the on site survey and the percent and number of
registered Texas boat owners who use their boats for saltwater fishing.  From
25 to 30 percent of all saltwater sportfishing boat trips originated from
unsurveyed launch sites.  Therefore, the TPWD on site boat survey
underestimates saltwater sportfishing boat pressure by 355,000 to 426,000
trips annually.  Of the estimated 79,200 saltwater fishing boat owners, 18
percent never launched from surveyed sites in 1982.

major obstacle, dynamically consistent or self-enforcing contracting, as
proposed by Vislie (1987), must be relied upon.  A more general model is

two countries may enjoy differing economic payoffs.  The predictions of the

Moreover, he concludes that the optimal amount is likely to be increasing over
time - a particularly serious problem in view of the irreversibility of many
environmental transformations.  This paper extends Krutilla's discussion in
two ways.  First, a model is developed for the allocation of natural
environments between preservation and development. Then, the model is applied
to the Hells Canyon issue of whether it should remain in its natural state or
be developed as a hydroelectric facility.

A mail survey of 1,984 U.S. billfish tournament anglers was completed to
examine their fishing activity, attitudes, trip expenditures, consumer's
surplus, catch levels, and management preferences.  A sample of 1,984 anglers
was drawn from billfish tournaments in the western Atlantic Ocean during 1989. 
A response rate of 61 percent was obtained.  Anglers averaged 13 billfish
trips per year, catching a billfish 40 percent of the time.  Eighty-nine
percent of billfish caught were released with less than one billfish per year
per angler retained.  Catch and retention rates varied by region. Expenditures
averaged $1,600 per trip, but varied by region.  The annual consumers's
surplus was $262 per angler, but increased to $448 per angler if billfish
populations were to increase.  An estimated 7,915 tournament anglers in the
U.S. western Atlantic spent $179 million in pursuit of billfish in 1989. 
Anglers opposed management options that would diminish their ability to catch
a billfish, but supported options limiting the number of billfish landed.

Fishery.""  Draft report, Department of Wildlife and Fisheries
Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, July.
A mail survey of tournament shark anglers and party boat shark anglers
was completed to examine their fishing activity, attitudes, trip expenditures,
and consumer surplus.  A sample of 700 shark anglers was selected from
tournaments in the Gulf of Mexico during 1990, and a sample of party boat
shark anglers was drawn from Port Aransas, Texas party boat anglers during the
summer of 1991.  A response rate of 58% (excluding non-deliverables) was
obtained from tournament anglers.  The sample of party boat shark anglers was
too small to provide useful results.  Tournament shark anglers reported
fishing an average of 58 days per year and targeted sharks and other large
marine species.  Tournaments occupy a small portion of their fishing effort. 
If this group of anglers were not able to fish for sharks, one-third indicated
no other species would be an acceptable substitute, while others were willing
to substitute other large marine species.  Shark trip expenditures averaged
$197 per trip with a consumer surplus of $111 per trip.  Based on MRFSS
estimates of the number of shark fishing trips, we estimate a total of $43
million was spent by shark anglers in the Gulf of Mexico with a consumer
surplus of $24 million  for a gross value of the shark fishery of $66 million. 
MRFSS estimates of the number of sharks landed indicate an equivalent use
value of $183 per shark.  Logit model results appear incorrect, no explanation
of consumer surplus derivation is given, no underlying economic model is
provided.197Fisher, Mark R. and Robert B. Ditton (1993).  ""A Social and Economic

summer of 1991.  A response rate of 58% (excluding non-deliverables) was
obtained from tournament anglers.  The sample of party boat shark anglers was
too small to provide useful results.  Tournament shark anglers reported
fishing an average of 58 days per year and targeted sharks and other large
marine species.  Tournaments occupy a small portion of their fishing effort. 
If this group of anglers were not able to fish for sharks, one-third indicated
no other species would be an acceptable substitute, while others were willing
to substitute other large marine species.  Shark trip expenditures averaged
$197 per trip with a consumer surplus of $111 per trip.  Based on MRFSS
estimates of the number of shark fishing trips, we estimate a total of $43
million was spent by shark anglers in the Gulf of Mexico with a consumer
surplus of $24 million  for a gross value of the shark fishery of $66 million. 
MRFSS estimates of the number of sharks landed indicate an equivalent use
value of $183 per shark.

This document reviews technology adopted by the fishing industry.  It
explains how technology required to comply with international conventions has
been further developed and adopted, on a voluntary basis, by the industry.  It
is suggested that to assess risks and reduce uncertainty, a thorough analysis
should be made of the world s fleets of fishing vessels and fishing gear; that
there should be a standard method for the measurement and classification of
fishing vessels and gear; and that fleet restructuring policies should be
elaborated on the basis of a full understanding of technology required for the
implementation of conservation and management measures (if they are to be
effective) as well as to benefit industry.  The document concludes that
requirements for the adoption of technology, or developments thereof, should
be incorporated in legislation.
Fitzpatrick, John and Chris Newton (1998).   Assessment of the World s Fishing
Fleet 1991-1997.   Greenpeace International, January.
The expansion in the size and capacity of the world s fishing fleets, as
noted by the FAO 1995 State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, has continued
to increase over the period 1991 - 1996.  A slow down in new additions
occurred in 1995 and 1996.  In 1997, the orders for new vessels show a return
to construction of vessels with large tonnage.  Throughout the period,
additions to the world s fleet continue to exceed deletions.  In this
connection, there is evidence that the fishing fleets are not being
restructured, that capacity is not being effectively reduced, and that states
with open registers are increasing their capacity.

The concept of maximum sustainable yield frontier (MSF) is applied to a
Gause model of competing species.  Maximizing the present value of economic
rent under costless harvesting with positive discount rate implies optimal
stock levels below the locus of MSF stocks.  Maximizing economic rent with
positive harvesting costs and zero discount rate implies optimal stock levels
above the locus of MSF stocks.  It is shown how the optimal steady state stock
levels are altered by changes in the exogenous discount rate, harvest prices,
and harvest costs.  Optimal harvesting might imply harvesting of one of the
two species at a loss.

Resource Rent in Limited Entry and Quota Managed Fisheries: The
Case of Norwegian Purse Seine Fisheries.""  Marine Resource
Economics , 10(4):341-356.
This paper tests empirically to what extent the rent in a limited entry
and quota managed fishery is capitalized in the value of a vessel license. 
This is done by comparing the profitability of Norwegian purse seine vessels
that received their licenses for free, to the profitability of vessels whose
licenses were purchased along with the vessel.  In a sample of forty three
vessels, thirty one had obtained their licenses for free when the licensing
system was introduced in 1973, whereas twelve owners had bought licensed
vessels later.  Costs and earnings data for 1983 and 1984 show that those
vessels that received free licenses have a significantly higher profitability
than the other vessel group.  The main reason for this is that the owners who
bought licensed vessels had the highest capital costs.  Policy implications of199these findings are indicated.

An empirical analysis of the yellowfin tuna catch of the eastern
tropical Pacific tuna fishery indicates that the difference between maximum
sustainable yield and maximum economic yield varies directly with the cost per
unit of effort and inversely with the price per unit of output.  If costs do
not rise, the difference approaches zero in a fishery characterized by
expanding demand and price.  If overcapitalization were avoided, resource rent
could be maximized.

Twelve African nations fishing for swordfish caught 2,166 tons in 1994. 
The majority of the catch was made by Morocco who caught 1,068 tons in the
North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.  Algerian fishermen caught 600 tons and
Tunisian fishermen caught 234 tons in the Mediterranean while Ghanaian canoe
fishermen landed 235 tons in the South Atlantic.  The importance of the
fishing grounds off West and Southwest Africa is not the harvest of African
fishermen -- mostly artisanal canoe fishermen -- but rather the potential for
significant catches by European flag or Asian flag fishermen.  The Spanish
swordfish fleet moved into the South Atlantic in 1986 and by 1994 reported a
harvest of 7,937 tons -- as compared with 264 tons harvested by Angola, Benin,
Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, South Africa, and Togo in these same waters in
1994.  In the Mediterranean Sea the North African nations face problems
associated with over exploitation during the past few decades that makes
catching swordfish increasingly difficult.  Kenyan fishermen reported modest200harvests of swordfish in 1990, but no recent harvest have been reported. 
Omani and Yemeni fishermen are landing small quantities of swordfish, but
landings may increase in 1995 if various joint venture projects sought by
Omani fishing companies can be finalized.  The French Overseas Department of
La Reunion has a swordfish fishery that lands about 400 tons annually; this
fishery is growing.

pp.201The Technical Working Group on the Management of Fishing Capacity
reviewed the various issues related to measurement and monitoring; management
and reduction methods; broader policy and institutional considerations; as
well as specific high seas aspects. The Technical Working Group (TWG)
emphasized the timeliness of this meeting and stressed the crucial need for
countries and the international community at large to urgently take steps to
address and prevent overcapacity (overcapitalisation) as recommended by the
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries which the FAO Conference adopted in
1995. The TWG produced a wide consensus on the need: to develop more
appropriate measurement methods and monitoring mechanisms, including fishing
vessel registry; to give far greater emphasis to fleet monitoring and the
assessment of fleet dynamics; to adopt policies which clearly specify access
conditions; to give a greater priority to management methods aiming at
adjusting rather than blocking the pervasive tendency for overfishing and
overinvestment resulting from open access conditions; to reassess and
strengthened management methods used and implementation procedure, in
recognition that the applicability of available management methods would
nevertheless remain situation specific; and to approach the reduction of
fishing capacity with care, avoiding spillover effects and carefully
controlling the induced effects of scrapping programmes. The TWG provided
guidance and made a number of recommendations to better address and tackle
these issues within national jurisdictions. The TWG also recognized that the
high seas may be confronted with an even greater overcapitalization problem
than EEZ fisheries due to the prevalence of rather open access conditions and
the fact that there are at present no internationally agreed measure to cause
states to control fishing capacity. It recommended that the 1995 UN Agreement
and the FAO Compliance Agreement be urgently ratified. The TWG further
suggested that complementary measures would be required, aiming in particular
at: improving monitoring mechanisms for high seas fleets; strengthening and
empowering regional fishery organizations; creating new organizations to
ensure full coverage of the resource concerned; controlling the disposal
( dumping ) of excess national capacity in general, and of older vessels to
developing countries in particular; and at addressing the growing importance
of flags of convenience. Finally, the TWG felt that much more research work
and institutional building efforts were still required at both national and
international levels to improve present capacities to properly address the
many issues pertaining to the effective control and reduction of fishing
capacity.

Bonus from the Sea , Report of a Technical Consultation on Shrimp
Bycatch Utilization held in Georgetown, Guyana, October 27-30,

The problem of postharvest loss derives from the carrying capacity of
the shrimp trawlers, reflecting design, size, operational system, and cost. 
The term bycatch refers to all the fish and other organisms incidentally
harvested by the trawling operations.  In the past, all the bycatch was
discarded into the sea and only the shrimp retained.  This practice resulted
in high losses from the discards.  Now, it has become increasingly common to
select and retain some marketable fish.  Bycatch quantities are, therefore, no
longer the same as the discards in every area where shrimp trawling occurs. 
Assessment is necessary for both the bycatch and the discards.

""Predicted Response of Northwest Atlantic Invertebrate and Fish
Stocks to CO 2-Induced Climate Change.""  Transactions of the
American Fisheries Society , 119:353-365.
We discuss the effect of changes in oceanographic conditions induced by
a global increase in atmospheric CO 2 on the location, composition, and
recruitment of invertebrate and finfish populations inhabiting the region from
the Gulf of Maine to the Labrador Shelf.  Published studies exist for the
region that link historical climate fluctuations with fish distributions or
that use physical data as proxy variables for nutrient flux, advection, and
stratification to predict species recruitment patterns and stock size
differences.  We used these models in conjunction with a physical
oceanographic scenario resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 to
speculate on the most probable consequences to the fisheries of Atlantic
Canada.  For example, a general warming and freshening of the continental
shelf waters is anticipated.  We expect this to lead to shifts in the
geographic distribution of several commercially important groundfish stocks,
especially those that are presently at the extreme limits of their species
ranges.  Earlier arrival times and later departures are expected for pelagic
species that undergo extensive seasonal migrations.  Higher temperatures and
increased water column stratification may result in less organic material
reaching the bottom and tend to favor a pelagic fish community.  Our analysis
is highly speculative, in part because of uncertainties in the predicted
physical changes, but also because of the limited knowledge of the processes
linking physical oceanography with fisheries.
Fraser, G. Alex (1979). ""Limited Entry: Experience of the British
Columbia Salmon Fishery.""  J. Fish. Res. Board Can. , 36:754-763.
In 1969 a program of limited entry was introduced in the B.C. salmon
fishery; this indicates the near desperation of fisheries managers at the
apparent bankruptcy of more traditional management measures.  Also, this
introduction represents a significant break in traditional management
orientation.  The goals of management were broadened to encompass not only
resource conservation, but also socioeconomic rationalization.  Unfortunately,
the program was ill designed to achieve either objective.  In spite of license
limitation it appears that fishing costs and fishing capacity are still
growing at a rapid rate.  Although vessel numbers are declining, much of the
potential benefits are being offset by increasing capacity and capital
intensity in the individual vessels that now make up the limited fleet.  While
some benefits may remain from the program due to the rapid increase in the
value of the salmon resource over recent years, the distribution of these
benefits is somewhat anomalous.  The public purse has gained little because
license revenues represent a small proportion of the total management costs of
the fishery.  At the same time, it cannot be interpreted that fishermen will
be the long run beneficiaries of the program.  The only clear winners are the
original group of license holders.  Various adjustments in the structure of205the licensing program have been considered to address these problems.  While
the most practical and effective of these is a system of landings royalties or
taxes on output, it remains the least politically attractive.  If the British
Columbia licensing programs is to become an effective vehicle for decreasing
fishing costs and fishing capacity, some difficult decisions are required.

A model is developed to estimate mean age-specific fecundity for sea
turtle populations.  Information on the numbers of eggs laid by female turtles
of known relative ages is used to estimate the mean number of eggs that will
be laid by females that are reproducing at a given age.  Information about
frequencies of interseasonal nesting intervals is then used to adjust the age-
specific fecundities to reflect the substantial proportion of females for each
age class that do not reproduce in a particular season (i.e., at a particular
age).  The model is developed with data collected on adult female loggerhead
turtles, Caretta  caretta , nesting on Little Cumberland Island, Georgia, USA,
from 1969 through 1981.  The model is applicable to species of marine and
freshwater turtles in which individual females may not reproduce each year
(i.e., at each consecutive age).
Frazer, Nat B. (1986).   Survival from Egg to Adulthood in a Declining
Population of Loggerhead Turtles, Caretta  Caretta .   Herpetologica ,
42(1):47-55.
Previous estimates of survival rates of sea turtle eggs or hatchlings to
adulthood depend upon the assumption that their populations are neither
increasing nor decreasing in numbers.  The assumption is made in spite of the
fact that recent interest in sea turtle demography stems from the belief that
populations are in decline.  This paper presents estimates of the survival
rate from egg to maturity necessary to maintain a populations of loggerhead
turtles, Caretta  caretta , at its present observed rate of decline. 
Conventional demographic equations were used along with values of adult
survivorship, fecundity and alternative estimates of age at maturity from the
literature.  Results indicate that the proportion of eggs surviving to
adulthood lies between 0.0009 and 0.0018 in this declining population, as
opposed to an estimated value of 0.0025 in the unlikely event that the
population is stationary.  These results suggest that previous studies have
overestimated survival of eggs or hatchlings to maturity in sea turtle
populations.  The methodology may be used to assess gross survivorship from
egg to adulthood in increasing or decreasing populations of any species in
which adults and eggs are more easily studied than are juveniles.

length fits von Bertalanffy growth models better than logistic models.  The
von Bertalanffy model for green turtle growth yields estimates for age at
maturity of between 18 and 27 years, based on the carapace length of the
smallest nesting female(88 cm) and the mean length of all nesting females (99
cm).  The model for loggerheads yields estimates of between 12 and 30 years,
also based on carapace measurements of the smallest nesting female (74 cm) and
the mean carapace length of all nesting females (92 cm).  It is suggested that
the upper estimates provide more realistic indications of mean age at first
maturity.

discussion of those techniques that are based on market interactions between
public and private goods.  The analysis is limited to those public goods that
are arguments in individual utility functions.  Public goods that are inputs
in production processes for marketed goods, for example, air quality in
agricultural production, affect cost, supply, and factor demand functions and
through them affect one or more of the following: output prices, factor
prices, and profits (quasi-rents). The benefits of increases in public goods
supply can be measured in a conceptually straightforward manner from
observable market data.

The question addressed in this report is whether the available economics
literature provides a basis for estimating the benefits to marine recreation
attributable to the water pollution control programs of federal, state, and
local agencies.  While numerous techniques exist, estimates of net benefit
from water quality improvements are not consistent.  No direct evidence exists
that supports the contention that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
(FWPCA) of 1972 has actual improved the recreational fishing experience.  It
appears that the upper bound estimates of fishing benefits from the FWPCA
should not exceed $1 billion per year.
Freeman, A. Myrick III (1995).  ""The Benefits of Water Quality
Improvements for Marine Recreation: A Review of the Empirical
Evidence."" Marine Resource Economics , 10(4):385-406.
This paper reviews the empirical literature on the economic value of
marine recreation fishing, beach visits, and boating.  Questions addressed
include: What values do people place on changes in the attributes of
recreation sites and activities?  What do we know about how water pollution
control policy affects these attributes?  And, is it feasible to use the value
information obtained for specific sites and/or activities to estimate the
benefits of improving marine water quality?  The literature establishes that
some measures of pollution reduce the values of trips to beaches and that
improved fishing success is valued by recreational anglers.  However, there is
substantial variation in value measures across studies.  Welfare estimates can
be sensitive to model specification and estimation.  In the case of marine
recreational fishing, the links between pollution control policy and the
attributes of the activity that people value (catch rate) have not been
established.

Development of marine recreational fisheries will help (1) to satisfy
the demands of a constantly growing number of recreational fishermen without
adversely affecting stressed fish populations; (2) to realize an economic gain
from presently underutilized stocks; (3) to promote or improve economic
development and employment opportunities in coastal communities; and (4) to
compensate for interannual fluctuations of stocks of target species of species
complexes.  Both the benefits and constraints to recreational development must
be considered when determining why marine recreational fishing should be
further developed.

Threatened Status of Steller Sea Lions, Eumetopias  jubatus , under the
Endangered Species Act: Effects on Alaska Groundfish Fisheries
Management.   Marine Fisheries Review , 57(2):14-27.
In April 1990, the Steller sea lion, Eumetopias  jubatus , was listed as
threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act by emergency action. 
Competitive interactions with the billion dollar Alaska commercial groundfish
fisheries have been suggested as one of the possible contributing factors to
the Steller sea lion population decline.  Since the listing, fisheries
managers have attempted to address the potential impacts of the groundfish
fisheries on Steller sea lion recovery.  In this paper, we review pertinent
Federal legislation, biological information on the Steller sea lion decline,
changes in the Alaska trawl fishery for walleye pollock, Theragra
chalcogramma , since the late 1970's, and possible interactions between
fisheries and sea lions.  Using three cases, we illustrate how the listing of
Steller sea lions has affected Alaska groundfish fisheries through: 1) actions
taken at the time of listing designed to limit the potential for direct human-
related sea lion mortality, 2) actions addressing spatial and temporal
separation of fisheries from sea lions, and 3) introduction of risk-adverse
stock assessment methodologies and Steller sea lion conservation
considerations directly in the annual quota setting process.  This discussion
shows some of the ways that North Pacific groundfish resource managers have
begun to explicitly consider the conservation of marine mammal and other
nontarget species.
Frost, Hans (1984). ""Fisheries Management and Uncertainty Within the
EEC.""  Marine Resource Economics , 1(1):97-103.
Fisheries management within the EEC is subject to ambiguous goal
formulations, ranging from the biological goal of maximum sustainable yield to
intangible political goals.  The management body within the EEC consists of
various official and political committees that impose both bureaucratic and
political uncertainty on the fishing industry.  It is argued here that, as a
result of this uncertainty, fishing effort in the short run will tend to rise,
but in the long run will tend to decline.  It is also argued that the
reduction of uncertainty will depend on a more careful and less ambiguous goal
formulation.

A constrained optimization model is developed to determine the impact of

and allocation, management and control costs, bioeconomic efficiency, income
distribution, and compliance in European Union fisheries.  Given the limited
yield from the fish stocks (implicit TAC), the transition from TAC to effort
regulation problem is to determine the level of effort, preferably expressed
in umber of fishing days for fleet segments, that corresponds to the amount of
fish a particular stock may yield, be it a quota or sustainable yield.

Social Optimality in Nonrenewable Resource Markets."" Journal of
Environmental Economics and Management , 17:1-21.
Dependence of electrical utilities on uncertain supplies of uranium
apparently has led to an unusual conditioning of uranium demand on the
uncertainty of supply that, in turn, depends on the volume of reserves.  This
paper examines the implications of controlling resource production uncertainty
through exploration.  Exploration gives a monopolistic resource supplier
another tool (in addition to restricting output) that can be used to exercise
market power.  Exploration, however, is not subject to antitrust regulation. 
Results show that traditional antitrust laws may move such an industry away
rather than toward social optimality.

May, 92 pp.
The Pacific herring Clupea pallasi  sac roe harvest in Alaska for 1993 is
projected to be 76,063 tons.  Herring food/bait harvests for 1993 are
projected to be 9,938 tons.  Herring spawn-on-pound-kelp fisheries are
expected to produce 335 tons of product and spawn-on-wild-kelp harvests are
expected to produce an additional 443 tons.  The projected sac roe, food/bait,
and spawn-on--kelp harvests are expected to increase from the 1992 levels. 
The 1992 herring harvest had an estimated value to fishermen of $31,504,867. 
Of the total 1992 value, sac roe fisheries contributed $25,160,330, spawn-on-
pound-kelp fisheries $3,722,000, food/bait fisheries $2,135,156, and spawn-on-
wild-kelp fisheries $487,381.  Excellent recruitment from the 1988 year class
in most areas has caused stock levels to increase.  In many areas the 1988
year class appears to be the largest on record.  This strong year class will
be age 5 for the 1993 harvest.

License Limitation and Buyback in the Texas Bay Shrimp Fishery."" 
Manuscript submitted to the American Journal of Agricultural
Economics .
The effect of a license limitation and buyback program being implemented
for the Texas bay shrimp fishery on effort, rents, license price, and consumer
and producer surplus is simulated.  Results indicate the current program will
not reduce effort and increase rents until year 16 of the program.  To
decrease the time necessary to reduce effort, additional funds to buyback
licenses are necessary.  Simulated results indicate that an additional
$500,000 available per year at the beginning of the program to buy licenses210will reduce effort and positive rents will be incurred starting in year three
of the program.  Increased funds available to the program also result in the
largest impact on consumer and producer surplus changes.  Although the present
value of changes is positive for both producer and consumer surplus, producers
clearly gain more than consumers.

Enforcement in the Fishery.""  Land Economics , 67(1):116-129.
The common property problem derives from the incompatibility of
individual incentives with collective interests.  In the fishery this
incompatibility results in a greater than optimum stock depletion. 
Authorities have responded to overfishing with a cornucopia of regulations. 
In practice, most of the widely employed regulations are not self-enforcing;
enforcement costs must therefore be incurred.  The purpose of the present
study is to investigate the deterrent effect of regulatory enforcement in the
fishery.  In particular, estimates of the so called ""supply of offenses: are
obtained with observations of individual behavior drawn from a random survey
of fishermen.  The study focuses upon the response of violation rates to
changes in different enforcement sanctions.  Insight into the relative
effectiveness of alternative enforcement tools may lead to a more efficient
regulatory policy.

Finally, the welfare gains that can be achieved by a movement from the free

A review of Goodyear s (1995) red snapper stock assessment that suggests
that environmental factors were not adequately addressed; specifically the

low in Goodyear s analysis.  His conclusions that variation of the natural
mortality rates would not change the results based on a sensitivity analysis
using conditional survival rates from fishing are misleading.  A broader
assessment is suggested that includes fishery, oceanographic, and habitat
submodels.  Goodyear (1996) refutes this review of the assessment.

After a detailed review of the information available on stock-
recruitment relationships and environmentally driven variations of abundance
in shrimp, the impact of this variability on the apparent shape of the SRR is
examined.  The existence of a strong autocorrelation in yearly data is
stressed and it is concluded that the presently available relationships do not
demonstrate that the recruitment of shrimps is a function of stock size. 
Examination of the particular case when seasonal relationships have been
established with monthly data shows that despite a certain similarity in shape
they should not be interpreted as SRR sensu stricto and a three dimensional
interpretation is proposed instead.  The other possible sources of error and
bias are finally examined and the consequences of the above findings on
management strategies are briefly discussed.

Consistency with market equilibrium places constraints on the pricing
policies of food marketing firms in a competitive industry.  This paper
examines the implications of simultaneous equilibrium in three related
markets: retail food, farm output, and marketing services.  From equations
representing the demand and supply sides of each market, elasticities are
generated that show how the farm-retail price spread changes when food demand,
farm product supply, or the supply function of marketing services shifts. 
Implications for the viability of simple markup pricing rules and the
determinants of the farmer's share of the food dollar are discussed.

Groundfish Sector in Atlantic Canada.""  Marine Resource Economics ,
5(4):389-432.
Following the extension of fisheries jurisdiction to 200 miles in 1977,
Canada managed its Atlantic groundfish fisheries using total allowable catches
and a variety of traditional controls on fishing effort.  These controls were
largely ineffective in resolving two of the inherent problems arising from the
common property characteristics of the fishery: competitive fishing in the
short run and the tendency toward overcapitalization in the long run.  In 1982
a system of output controls in the form of enterprise allocations was
implemented in the offshore sector of the fishery.  This article describes the
elements of the system and examines the changes in operating and investment
behavior of the companies holding the enterprise allocations.  The bundle of
rights incorporated in the enterprise allocation is assessed and suggestions
are made on how these rights might be modified to improve gains in efficiency
already achieved.  A case study of the impact of the system on one vertically
integrated company is presented.  The merits of the system are contrasted with
behavior in the inshore sector still subject to traditional input controls.

This paper examines the Canadian experience with quota managed
fisheries, reviewing institutional structures and approaches.  It begins with
a review of management objectives following the extension of jurisdiction and
traces the nature and rationale of changes.  The specific measures used to
achieve objectives are examined from a theoretical and practical perspective. 
The measures fall into two broad categories: conventional input controls:215vessel and gear restrictions; and, output controls: tradable and non-tradable
enterprise/individual quotas.  The experience indicates that input controls
are largely ineffective in constraining effort.  These measures fail to
address the common property characteristics of the resource and consequently
failed to blunt the incentives for share maximization and increased
capitalization.  These in turn lead to overfishing and misreporting, thereby
undermining management objectives.  Output controls fare better in
constraining effort.  They lead to fleet rationalization and improved quality
and flow of raw material to processing facilities.  But they may also lead to
highgrading and discarding, as quantity incentives give way to unit value
incentives under the rights based regime.  Some of the early failures and more
recent successes of policy are outlined, lessons are drawn and suggestions
made about future directions.

Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics , 22(3):1-12.
Despite considerable work in fisheries economics on the supply side,
little attention has been devoted to theoretical aspects of the relationship
between ex-vessel price and landings.  One of the widely recognized
determinants of fish prices is fish size, yet virtually all empirical analyses
of the demand for fish ignore fish size.  In this paper a demand function is
postulated that includes fish size as a continuous demand shift parameter and
the implications of fish size to the relationship between price and quantity
are examined.  It is concluded that bioeconomic models of the fishery that
ignore fish size may yield policy conclusions that are quantitatively and, in
some cases, qualitatively inaccurate.216Gates, John M. (1984).  ""Principal Types of Uncertainty in Fishing

Uncertainty in harvest has received relatively little study in fisheries
economics.  Given a paucity of literature in the area, this paper describes
uncertainty in very general terms and uses sample data from several sources to
illustrate the discussion.  Major sources of uncertainty in harvest are
identified as catch rates, equipment performance, prices, weather, quality of
inputs, and institutions.

The New England industry has been the focus of much research related to
fisheries management and the economic status of fishermen.  It has proven
difficult to monitor economic status because of technical, bureaucratic and
cost considerations associated with survey procedures.  The authors have
developed an alternative approach that combines information various data
bases, including periodic surveys, and integrates them in a budgeting or
economic engineering approach.  The development of these programs originated
on mainframe computers but has since been adapted to personal computers.  The
result of these adaptations is a tool useful for extension education as well
as for research policy evaluation.  This paper outlines the basic components
of the vessel simulator for otter trawlers and presents selective results
illustrating its use for policy analysis.  Other applications are suggested
for financial advisors and investors.

This report describes programs called  buyback programs  which buy back

of the report is to survey buyback programs in various parts of the world to
glean lessons from the history of such attempts.  The second part was to be a
case study of the current attempt at vessel buybacks in New England and would
relate other program experiences back to the New England experiment to
determine possible outcomes.  Given the greater resistance in the U.S. to

This report describes programs called  buyback programs  which buy back
fishing vessels and permits in limited access fisheries.  The first objective
of the report is to survey buyback programs in various parts of the world to
glean lessons from the history of such attempts.  The second part was to be a
case study of the current attempt at vessel buybacks in New England and would
relate other program experiences back to the New England experiment to
determine possible outcomes.  Given the greater resistance in the U.S. to
governmental intervention and control, it is unlikely that the U.S. will have
better luck than other countries in conserving fishery resources via vessel
buybacks.

February, 32 pp.
The results of an economic survey of small northeast fishing vessels
using otter trawl gear is described.  The population consisted of 572 persons
who were holders of groundfish permits, had fishing vessels of 65 feet or
less, and who reported catches in New England using trawl gear in 1996.  A 10
percent response rate was achieved from a mail survey of a questionnaire that
generated 35 usable responses from a probable population of 420 fishermen. 
The results of our mail survey of small trawlers are presented in three sets
of tables and 2 figures.  Each table summarizes quantitative data responses by
providing two or more measures of central tendency (the mean or  average  and
the median), and two measures of variability (the standard deviation and the
range).

It is widely believed that exhaustible resource monopolies do not enjoy
as much market power as standard non-resource monopolies, and may even produce
in a socially optimal way.  We argue that this paradoxical result arises from
an inappropriate comparison methodology.  When similar assumptions are applied
to the resource and the conventional case, we show that the resource monopoly
behaves as expected; i.e. restricts supply.

As fishery resources in the northeastern U.S. decline, allocation of

the northeast, approximately 8,000 anglers from Maine to Virginia were
administered a two-part survey (at the fishing site, and in a follow-up phone

Fisheries Statistical Survey.  Using striped bass as a case study, contingent
valuation, travel cost and random utility models are estimated, and the

Economists have understood that the open access nature of fishing

increasing speculation that fishermen respond to falling output price either
by increasing or decreasing effort, depending on the circumstances.  This
suggests a short run backward bending supply of fishing labor.  A dynamic
model of fishermen s behavior is developed to account for the behavior.  The
model highlights both contemporaneous and intertemporal trade offs between
labor and leisure.  The model is tested and the results indicate that the

Herein it si argued that ITQs are primarily designed to address the economic
shortcomings of open access but that conservation benefits can result form the
vesting aspects and economic rationalization of an ITQ.  Preliminary evidence
form the wreckfish case suggests that fishermen have embraced the long-term
conservation of the wreckfish stock and habitat where wreckfish are found
because it is clearly in their best economic interest to do so.  Optimism must
remain guarded at this point because results are preliminary, wreckfish is a
rather different fishery, and the wreckfish ITQ has apparently shifted fishing
effort to other fisheries still managed by open access, hereby potentially
aggravating problems in those fisheries.  These caveats acknowledged, early
success with the wreckfish ITQ argues for expansion of the effort to put other
fisheries under ITQs and underlines the importance of developing a
comprehensive policy to evaluate and implement ITQ management for other
fisheries in the United States.

A system of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) was introduced into
the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery in 1984.  This was the first such
management system to be introduced in Australia and among the first worldwide. 
Its introduction marketed a radical departure from traditional management
regimes based on limiting the number of boats allowed to operate and other
input controls.  Because ITQs are a potential management option for many other
fisheries, their success or otherwise in improving the economic performance
and prospects of the SBT fishery is likely to have ramifications for the
future direction of fisheries management in Australia.  The impact of the ITQ
scheme on fishery profitability is assessed in relation to the expected
outcomes of alternative management programs if they had been introduced
instead of ITQs.  A model that draws together the major biological, physical,
and economic relationships in the fishery provides a framework for this
analysis.

Production costs for fresh Atlantic groundfish and scallop processing
are examined using direct observation, linear regression analysis, and cost
accounting.  Assuming that management chooses a production technique where
marginal costs are constant over a wide range of production due to
management s expectation of predictable and unpredictable variation in product
demand and exvessel supply, estimates of marginal cost for nonfish inputs from
linear regression results and from cost accounting are compared.  Also,
regression results for physical yield from fish inputs are compared to
estimates from the U.S. Department of Commerce.  The similarity in results
between these independent forms of estimation supports the maintained
hypothesis of constant marginal cost over a wide range of production.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency has responsibility
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to
formulate pesticide policies on the basis of risk-benefit analyses.  To
measure the benefits of pesticide use, one must look at the losses in consumer
and producer surpluses that would accompany the banning of a particular
pesticide.  A typical scenario is one in which the banned pesticide is
replaced by another that is more costly and/or less effective.  The resulting
decrease in supply raises the price of the crop on which the banned pesticide
is used, and may alter the prices of substitute and complementary corps as
well.  This article presents a simulation model of corn and soybean
implications of a local ban on triazine herbicides.  It reports estimates of
lost producer and consumer surplus and the effect that the ban would have on
the profitability of agricultural production in the region.

Gilbert, David John (1988).  ""Use of a Simple Age-Structured Bioeconomic
Model to Estimate Optimal Long-Run Surpluses."" Marine Resource
Economics , 5:23-42.
When the New Zealand government introduced individual transferable
quotas for major commercial fish stocks, allocation for some stocks exceeded
their total allowable catches and made it necessary to buy back immediately
some of the quota.  Quota was offered back by tender.  A simple age structured
bioeconomic model was used to estimate long run optimal surpluses.  From
these, the maximum prices that should be paid by government for quota were
derived.  The use of an age structured model proved convenient for this
purpose as the necessary parameter estimates tend to arise naturally from
literature sources and the population dynamics are transparent.  If stocks
were managed optimally, the long run value of quota would be equivalent to the
net present value of the surplus at the dynamic maximum economic yield.  Long
run surpluses proved to be dependent on the relative changes in catch rates
and costs of fishing that resulted from changes in stock biomass.  Optimal
surpluses of up to 45% of the greenweight revenues were obtained for heavily
exploited, long lived stocks.  Only small long run surpluses were obtained for
short lived or very lightly exploited stocks.

This paper characterizes optimal extraction from a resource stock of
uncertain size and examines the value of information about the size of the
stock assuming costs and social preferences are known.  Given fairly typical
assumptions, uncertainty implies a more conservative extraction policy when
exploration does not exist.  With exploration possible, it is shown to be
optimal to invest in exploration to maintain a stock of known reserves.

To better address the charter and party boat fishery needs in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico, fishery managers must understand the linkages between the
industry and other groups and organizations that affect its success.  Gulf
state charter and party boat operators were interviewed to ascertain the
extent of their social network linkages, membership in community
organizations, business community relationships, and linkages to information
sources.  Approximately one-third to one-half of the charter and party boat
operators did not belong to local community organizations that could assist
their business through tourism promotion or natural resource protection. 
Despite their limited integration in the community, the vast majority of
operators gave and received referrals from other businesses.  Of four major
information sources, the National Weather Service and the County Marine
Extension agents were rated highest and lowest, respectively, in mean
importance to charter and party boat operators.  Results suggest that business
success can be enhanced by strengthening network ties between operators and
local businesses, chambers of commerce, and tourism organizations.  For this
to occur, individual operators and charter/party boat organizations need to
become more effective in representing industry interests.  Informational
linkages between industry and government agencies also need improvement.

This study assesses the economic feasibility of imposing a quota on
shrimp imports.  Thai study was based on the primary hypothesis that a quota
on shrimp imports, if used by itself and not coordinated with a program
designed to limit the entry of more craft into the industry, would not improve
the economic position of the average shrimp fisherman in the industry.  More
specifically, it was hypothesized that a quota would increase wholesale and
ex-vessel prices more than they would have increased without the quota; the
increase in prices would encourage the entry of more craft into the industry;
and the increase in the number of craft in the industry and rising cost would
prevent the real revenue per craft from increasing.  A secondary objective of
this study was to assess the economic feasibility of imposing a limit on the
number of craft in the industry.  It was hypothesized that a limit on the
number of craft in the industry, if used by itself, would not increase the
deflated revenue per craft.  Another secondary objective was to assess the
effect on the shrimp population of increases in fishing effort.  It was
hypothesized that increases in fishing effort would overfish the shrimp
population and actually reduce the quantity of shrimp supplied.

In the multi-cohort bioeconomic models that have been developed for226fishery policy evaluation, the length of the planning period and the state of

factors influence the results.  It is suggested that this limitation can be
overcome by evaluating policy over an infinite horizon.  An optimization model
for evaluating policy in a multi-cohort single species fishery over an
infinite planning horizon id developed by incorporating results from a steady
state fishery model in a multi-period model.  The use of this approach is
illustrated using data for the western mackerel fishery.

Over the past 30 years, a widely accepted model of  open-access 
fisheries has been developed, yet empirical tests of the standard model have
been relatively few.  One difficulty is that fish stocks, the levels of which
affect the rate of catch, are not directly observable.  Simplifying
assumptions are generally required, such as the assumption that catchability
does not change over time.  Estimation on the basis of the standard model also
raises difficulties in specification, if contemporaneous correlation of the

Spawning stock biomass per recruit (SSBR) estimates the expected

SPR is widely used in U.S. fisheries managed under the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act, usually in the context of a percentage of the

size and age composition of the 1992 commercial and recreational catches that
were not available for the previous assessment.  The time series available to
estimate catch per unit effort for all sectors of the recreation fishery are
also extended through 1992.  These data were used to re-estimate historical
fishing mortalities for the directed fishery and shrimp bycatch mortality
using the methods described in the earlier assessment.  The possible
implications for several management alternatives were also forecasted based on
the current best estimates of fishing mortality and recruitment.  The results
of the present analyses are presented in figures and tables numbered to

The 1994 red snapper stock assessment report concludes that the stock
conservation measures currently in place are enhancing the condition of the
stock.  However, if the 50% reduction in bycatch mortality rate is not
achieved in the near future, it will not be possible to attain the spawning
stock goals of the plan by the target date of 2009 and to also allow the
directed fishery to operate under the current catch limit of 6 million pounds. 
These estimates are considerably more pessimistic than those presented in
1993, primarily because the 1993 and 1994 catches exceeded TAC.

Miami Laboratory, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Miami, FL,
June, 26 pp.
The effects of uncertainty about growth of U.S. Gulf of Mexico red
grouper ( Epinephelus  morio) on estimates of their population statistics was
evaluated by computing the statistics for each of several competing von
Bertalanffy growth equations fitted to length at age data from different
sources and time periods.  Estimates of asymptotic lengths varied from 27.7
inches to 68 inches total length.  These equations were used to estimate the
age composition of the 1986-1992 combined harvest and to estimate total
mortality through means of catch curves constructed for 1986-1989, before the
20 inch minimum size and for 1990-1992  when the minimum size was in place. 
All of the mortality rate estimates and yield per recruit (YPR) and spawning
potential ratio (SPR) evaluations assume equilibrium conditions.  The catch
curve estimates of mortality that were derived from ages estimated from
lengths were biased low.  Simulated data were analyzed to develop bias
correction equations which were subsequently used in an attempt to remove the
bias.  Estimated total mortality for fully recruited ages ranged from Z=0.286
to Z=0.548 for 1986-1989 and from Z=0.453 to Z=1.545 for 1990-1992 depending
on the growth model selected.  This equilibrium assumption is known to be
violated for the later period, because of the introduction of the 20 inch
minimum size, hence the latter estimates are suspect.  The consequence of this
defect was not evaluated.  The results of this study support additional
detailed examination of red grouper growth rates.  Furthermore, if age
structured assessment methods are to be employed with this stock we must begin
routine collection of data to develop annual age-length keys to estimate the
age composition of the catch of this fishery.

SPR in 1984 varied with the assumed post bycatch natural mortality
level.  At M=0.1, the SPR was estimated to be below 1%.  Corresponding values
for M=0.15 and M=0.2 were about 3% and 4%, respectively.  The estimate for
each level of post bycatch natural mortality is far below the minimally
acceptable level of 20% adopted by the Gulf Council for this fishery.  There
has been very little improvement in the estimates since 1984, partly because
year classes partly protected by recent conservation actions have not yet
become important contributors to the spawning stock.  Several scenarios of
total allowable catch (TAC)and shrimp bycatch mortality reductions were
evaluated.  In each the bycatch mortality was reduced 5.8% in 1993 and 10.1%
in 1994 from the 1984-1989 mean based on reduced shrimp effort.  The
projections indicate that, if shrimp bycatch mortality is reduced to 24% in
1996, 37% in 1997, and 50% in 1998 of the 1984-1989 average, the TAC for 1995
could be 4536 tons (10 million pounds) or less and still meet the SPR goal by
the target date.

To examine the consequences of possible bias in the estimates of red
snapper bycatch in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery, the number of juveniles
taken as part of the bycatch were adjusted downward by 14 and 33 percent. 
Adjusting for these biases only slightly improves the estimates of current
stock status.  A 50 percent reduction in shrimp bycatch is still required in
1997.  The magnitude of the postulated error in the bycatch estimates is
insufficient to meaningfully affect the need to reduce bycatch of red snapper
by the shrimp fishery.

of Detect the Influence of Spawning Stock on Recruitment.""  North
American Journal of Fisheries Management , 4:186-193.
Simulated observations of spawning stock size, recruitment, and two
random environmental variables were obtained from a density-independent Leslie
matrix model.  Recruitment to age 1 was directly proportional to population
fecundity but strongly influenced by the effects of the random environmental
variables.  The simulated observations were subjected to multiple regression
analysis that detected the influence of the random environmental variables but
did not reliably detect the influence of spawning stock. these results
indicate that multiple regression is unreliable in detecting the influence of
stock on recruitment when annual variations in recruitment are primarily due
to environmental factors.

The conservation measures currently in place are unlikely to enhance the
condition of the stock without the assistance of an unforeseen,
environmentally controlled increase in recruitment. Stringent conservation
measures will be required of the directed fishery to attain the spawning stock
goals of the Plan and will likely be required to persist indefinitely if the
shrimp trawl discard mortality cannot be controlled.

Engle-Granger and Johansen procedures.  Short run price dynamics are measured

from 1980 to 1992, the empirical results show no long run price relationships
for fresh cod between European and U.S. markets, but we do measure long run
price linkages for frozen cod fillets.  Withing Europe the markets for both
fresh and frozen cod product are well integrated.  The U.S. fresh cod market
is distinct and separate from European markets, while the U.S. frozen cod
market shows no short run links to European markets.  There is weak evidence
for a long run international market in frozen cod fillets.

Resource: The Fishery."" Journal of Political Economy , 62:124-42.
This paper examines the economic theory of natural resource utilization
as it pertains to the fishing industry.  It will appear that most of the
problems associated with the words ""conservation"" or ""depletion"" or
""overexploitation"" in fisheries are manifestations of the fact that the
natural resources of the sea yield no economic rent.  Fishery resources are
unusual in the fact of their common property nature; but they are not unique,
and similar problems are encountered in other cases of common property
resource industries, such as petroleum production, hunting and trapping, etc. 
Although the theory presented in the following pages is worked out in terms of
the fishing industry, it is applicable generally to all cases where natural
resources are owned in common and exploited under conditions of
individualistic competition.233Gordon, H. Scott (1958). ""Economics and the Conservation Question.""

The chief purpose of this paper is to present, in as nontechnical terms

Commercial fish harvesters are often able to exploit fisheries resources
beyond sustainable levels, heightening competition and reducing their incomes. 
Limited access (restricting who is allowed to harvest fisheries resources) is
one approach to addressing such problems.  This paper describes the three
basic limited access mechanisms (input restrictions: licenses and permits;
economic disincentives: taxes and fees; and harvest allocations: harvester
quotas and shares) and briefly catalogs existing limited access programs. 
There are also sections on case law involving limited access in the United
States and on access to other natural resources as well as an extensive
bibliography on limited access.

of the Tidal Marsh.""  LSU-SG-74-03, Center For Wetland Resources,
Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA.
Natural tidal marshes are evaluated in monetary terms.  Byproduct
production (fisheries, etc.) on a per acre basis yields a value of only about
$100 per year, even when the whole value of the fishery is imputed to the
marsh.  More intensive uses, such as oyster aquaculture, that preserve many of
the natural functions of the marsh-estuarine ecosystem, have a potential up to
$1000 per acre per year.  The potential for waste assimilation is much higher,
about $2500 per acre per year for tertiary treatment.  Summation of the
noncompeting uses approaches an ecological life support value of about $4000
per acre per year, based on the gross primary productivity (in energy terms)
of the natural marsh, using a conversion ratio from energy to dollars based on
the ratio of Gross National Product to National Energy Consumption.  When
these annual social values of $2500 - $4000 are income capitalized at a 5%
interest rate the estimated total social values are $50,000 to $80,000 per
acre.  Some estuaries, such as the Potomac or the Hudson, are now performing
waste assimilation work of even greater value, but such estuaries are
overloaded to the point of degradation.
Analysis based on the total value of the life support role of a natural
tidal marsh-estuary suggests that a strategy of optimization in land use
planning should replace, or supplement, reliance on the pricing system which
is inadequate for preservation of natural systems that increase in value with
the intensity of adjacent development.

White Shrimp in the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico.""  Transactions of

The annual spawner-recruit relationship for white shrimp Penaeus
setiferus in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico did not show a significant
correlation (0.10>P>0.05) from 1973 to 1984.  I attribute this to the effect
of environmental factors as well as to the interannual variability of
recruitment strength in the main cohorts throughout each year.  A Ricker
stock-recruitment relationship was established for dominant cohorts in the
1973-1984 study period.  The variance explained by the model increased from 70
to 82% (multiple correlation r=0.903, P<0.001) when river discharges during
the spawning month and before recruitment were included.  I propose that the
magnitude of recruitment largely depends on the carrying capacity of critical
nursery habitats.  Fishing effort is related to recruit abundance and has a
direct effect in determining spawner stock size (multiple correlation r=0.91,
P<0.001).  Through multiple-regression techniques, a surface was defined where
the recruitment level varied according to spawning stock size as well as to
river discharge.

The paper presents a comparison of different methods of rent capture and
the first empirical analysis of the effects of rent capture upon a fishery
managed with individual transferable quotas.  Using simulations from a unit
profit function, individual vessel profits that include intra-marginal rents
and a resource rent are predicted for 1990.  A quota rental charge, profit
charge, lump sum charge, and an ad valorem royalty are then compared on a
theoretical basis and with simulations using the predicted profits of fishers. 
The criteria for comparison include their effect on the distribution of
profits after rent capture, distortions imposed on the fishery, the relative
tax burden imposed on different fishers, flexibility to adjust to changes in
the fishery, and the potential for fishers to avoid paying a rental charge.

The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model exemplifies the implicit and
explicit assumptions managers often have regarding species interaction -
populations are stable or fluctuate periodically.  The reality is often much
more complicated and there is overwhelming evidence that many populations
fluctuate in a nonperiodic way.  Using a discrete predator-prey model that
generates chaos, it is possible to qualitatively mimic the interaction of some
predator-prey populations.  The implications of the paper are that managers
should place greater emphasis on theoretical modeling and simulations, try to
understand ecosystems and broad relationships between species rather than
obtain minute details and data on individual populations, make management as
flexible as possible to help people adjust to rapid changes in populations,
employ mixed strategies so as to give options whatever the underlying
dynamics, and, where appropriate, experiment with different strategies for
different subpopulations to learn more about the effectiveness of alternative
management approaches.

Bioeconomic Simulation Model for Annual Crop Marine Fisheries."" 
Ecological Modeling , 13:195-219.
A generalized bioeconomic simulation model (GBFSM) of annual crop marine
fisheries is described and its use in marine fisheries management is
demonstrated.  The biological submodel represents the recruitment of new
organisms into the fishery, the movement of organisms from one fishing area to
another and from one depth to another, the growth of organisms and the
mortality of organisms resulting from both natural causes and from fishing. 
The economic submodel represents the fishing effort exerted on each resource
species, the monetary costs of fishing, the value of the harvest and the rent
(or excess profits) to the fishery.
Basic dynamics of the model result from changes in the number of
organisms in the fishery over time, which can be summarized as a set of
difference equations of the general form
CN/Ct = R + I - E - M - F
where CN/Ct is the net change in number of organisms in the fishery over time
(t), R is recruitment, I is immigration, E is emigration, M is natural
mortality, and F is fishing mortality.  The driving variable is R whereas I,
E, M, and F are functions of the state of the system at any given point in
time.  The model can be run in a deterministic or stochastic mode.  Values for
parameters affecting rates of recruitment, movement, growth, natural mortality
and fishing mortality can be selected from uniform, triangular or normal
distributions.
Use of the model within a fisheries management framework is demonstrated
by evaluating several management alternatives for the pink shrimp fishery on237the Tortugas grounds in the Gulf of Mexico.  Steps involved in use of the
model, including parameterization, validation, sensitivity analysis and
stochastic simulations of management policies are explained.

Expository Review."" Journal of Marketing Research , May:155-271.
Over the past few years hybrid models for conjoint analysis have been
developed to reduce data collection effort and time.  Hybrid models combine
features of selfexplicated utility measurement with more traditional conjoint
analysis.  A classification of hybrid models is presented, followed by a
review of their comparative performance in cross validation tests.  Though
hybrid models represent an attempt to cope with an important practical problem
in industry applications of conjoint techniques, these models entail a number
of untested assumptions requiring further theoretical analysis and empirical
research.  Suggestions are offered on future studies that are essential before
the role of hybrid models in conjoint methods can be evaluated properly.

Green, Trellis G. (1984). ""Compensating and Equivalent Variation of the
Florida Saltwater Tourist Fishery.""  Ph.D. Dissertation,
Department of Economics, Florida State University.
The study establishes the value in recreational use of Florida's
saltwater tourist fishery, using exact Hicksian compensating and equivalent
variation methods.  The Hicksian approach removes the approximating error of
Marshall's consumer surplus measures.  The theoretical model underlying the
angling experience emphasizes the multipurpose mature of the tourist trip.  It
is based upon a Gibbs type approach in which variable on-site cost proxies
market price and travel cost enters the budget constraint. On-site cost and
angling success rate are explicitly incorporated into a system of behavioral
relations.  Some restrictive assumptions found in similar studies are relaxed
with composite goods utility.  Empirical estimates for aggregated and subgroup
angling categories are made with multiple equation models of identified linear
and nonlinear specifications.  There is some evidence that shore anglers might
be more and less sensitive to changes in on-site cost and success rate,
respectively.  Single equation models are also used, but exhibit downward
coefficient bias.  Results corroborate the findings of previous studies that
the market and nonmarket values of Florida's marine recreational fishery are
very large relative to state product and/or commercial sector activity. 
Inelastic short run price and success rate elasticity is confirmed.  Hicksian
methods are not shown to be significantly more accurate than most Marshallian
ones, except in the case of the direct aggregate user opinion method. 
Sensitivity analysis offers policy implications supporting a marine tourist
fishing license and stock rebuilding schemes, such as bag limits for depleted
species.  The unrecoverable deadweight burden to society caused by a $10
annual tourist fishing license is less than one percent of the $31 million in
direct, adjusted license revenues estimated to be forthcoming annually.

The author undertakes an assessment of the MRFSS data base using red
drum as a target species in a recreational fishing trip.  A red drum angler
profile is provided and success elasticity is estimated and used in the
estimation of welfare benefits of red drum reallocation management measures. 
A suggested policy to move the fishery closer to optimal yield is a
reallocation of red drum stocks to recreational anglers.  One weakness of the
study is the lack of a comparable commercial harvest sector to base model
conclusions concerning reallocation.240Green, Trellis G. (1994).  ""Allocation Between Commercial and
Recreational Sectors in Stressed Marine Fisheries.""  Society and

This paper provides an overview of the economic approach to open access,
optimum fishery allocation between commercial and recreational users.  The
goal is to familiarize noneconomists with efficiency concepts, such as net
benefit, that pertain to optimum allocation.  A theoretical model of the
policy trade off between economic efficiency and social equity is also
developed.  Net benefit is distinguished from economic impact that cannot
guarantee optimum allocation.  Finally, empirical methods are applied to the
red drum fishery in the Gulf of Mexico.  Results support policies that
reallocate wild red drum from the commercial to the recreational fishery.

The Alaska snow crab fishery has increased in commercial importance as
the king and Tanner crab stocks have declined.  The commercial success of snow
crab has led to a rejuvenation of the Alaska crab fleet.  This success has led
to important economic questions about snow crab markets.  This paper is the
first to econometrically model the world snow crab markets and addresses the
specific question of whether a 400 million pound harvest in 1992 would have
enhance gross receipts to the Alaska snow crab fleet.  The results do not
support industry s concern that a 1992 400 million pound harvest would have
depressed gross fishery returns.

Economic issues in managing the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are

Amendments of 1978.  Specifically, regulations versus economic incentives to
avoid oil spills, social tradeoffs of alternative leasing systems, and the
rate of leasing are discussed.  Basically, the EEZ proclamation does not raise
any fundamentally new management issues for oil and gas exploitation in
federal waters.  Nonetheless, the economic importance of the hydrocarbon
resources in federal waters, the variety of diverging interests concerned with
their development, and the movement of exploitation toward deeper waters and
harsher environments assure that the management of oil and gas in the EEZ will
remain a topic of considerable significance and public debate.

Several pieces of federal environmental regulation establish strict

discusses the approach proposed by the U.S. Department of Interior for
evaluating ""Type A"" spills of oil or hazardous substances in the marine
environment.  The approach employs an integrated ocean systems/economic model
to simulate the physical fates, biological effects, and the resulting economic
damages from spills in the marine environment.  Some preliminary results are
presented for hypothetical spills of a number of substances in a variety of
environments.  The results show that the size and shape of the damage function
depend on a variety of properties of the substance spilled and the environment
in which the spill occurs.

of owning and operating a shrimp vessel in the Gulf of Mexico.  Lower shrimp
prices coupled with rapidly escalating prices for fuel and other input items
have brought about a cost-price squeeze that has put the vessel owners in a
struggle for economic survival.  Cost and returns estimates are based on 1971

By accounting for the dynamics of the shrimp population, a more accurate
representation of the gains and losses from the implementation of TED
regulations was provided.  Percent loss by region varied with the fishing
pressure of each region; the higher the fishing pressure the less the overall
loss to each region.  Across all regions, an estimate by the NMFS of a 10%
loss in shrimp retention due to the use of TEDs translated only to an overall
5.3% loss in landings in the entire Gulf region.  In economic terms, this
renders a 16.2 million dollar loss of rent to vessels and crew in the shrimp
fishing industry in the Gulf of Mexico.  Regional compliance ranged from 61 to
91% based on Coast Guard estimates, therefore, overall loss in rent was
reduced to 12.8 million dollars.  However, the loss in rent to vessel owners
and crew who complied with the TED regulation was 15.7 million dollars, while
the gain in rent to non-complying owners and crew was 2.9 million dollars. 
The overall loss to the Gulf of Mexico shrimp industry, based on the 1990
individual tow losses of 0.7%, was a decline in rent of 4.5 million dollars
most of which was due to the purchase of the TEDs.  These short run results
indicate that nominal days fished in the long run must decrease for the
industry to move to a new equilibrium.  This is true across all vessel classes
and regions, since they all incurred negative rents.  Estimating the net
present value for this adjustment process, over time, is reserved for future
analysis.
Two problems with the analysis are the short run time scale employed and
the use of a homogeneous fleet assumption.  Limiting the analysis to the
impacts next year does not allow the fleet size to adjust to increased costs
and reduced revenues caused by adoption of the TEDs in their harvesting
operations.  A stock effect from reduced fleet size should cause the catch per
unit effort to increase and total catch to remain the same.  The analysis uses
the assumption of a homogeneous fleet where total revenue equals total cost
even though three separate vessel size classes are employed in the analysis. 246The impacts of TEDs on the highliner is not accounted for using this
assumption.  Given the stock effect and the reduced fleet size, the
inframarginal firm could actually generate a positive rent due to the adoption
of TEDs by the marginal firm.

of Applied Aquaculture , 4(3):1-22.
Stochastic sensitivity analysis was used to examine a combined indoor
fingerling and outdoor grow-out red drum aquaculture facility.  Three
important biological and three important economic factors were varied
individually to determine the chance of survival (farm does not go bankrupt),
and chance of economic success (net present value greater than zero).  Because
individuals have a different preference for risk, an investor must determine
his own required rate of return (RRR) for his investment.  For this reason,
chances of economic success ranging from 5 to 20% are given in the results. 
If an investor's RRR is below 10%, he has a better chance of achieving
economic success if the farm is 100% equity financed.  If his RRR is greater
than 10%, he has a better chance of achieving economic success if the farm is
50% equity financed.  Finally, management capabilities have a tremendous
impact on chances of economic success.

The Vessel Budget Simulator System (VBSS) enables a user to select and
equip a vessel to be operated in any fishing ground normally frequented by
U.S. owned vessels.  The physical flow of inputs into the production process
aboard a vessel is simulated to produce the information required for financial
reports.  This system consists of two programs; a data management program
(DMP) in COBOL that is used to create and update direct access (D-A) physical
inventory files and a budget simulation program (BSP) in FORTRAN that performs
all operational procedures.  Part 1 of the manual describes the use of the DMP
while Part 2 describes the use of the BSP.

""Optimum Effort and Rent Distribution in the Gulf of Mexico Shrimp
Fishery.""  American Journal of Agricultural Economics  Nov:644-652.
Traditional methods used to estimate fishing effort that maximize rent
to an open access resource have almost universally assumed all costs are
directly proportional to effort.  When crews receive a fixed share of gross
returns, labor costs are proportional to catch.  Hence, rent accrues to crews
as well as vessel owners under limited entry.  A model that allows costs to be
proportional to effort and catch is applied to the Gulf of Mexico shrimp
fishery.  This study indicates that traditional analysis would result in
management schemes that overtax vessels and ignore rent accruing to crews.

The economic impact of the effects of the Turtle Excluder Device (TEDs)
used in the Gulf of Mexico to control the numbers of turtles caught in shrimp
trawl nets is analyzed.  This is a major concern to the shrimp fishing economy
due to the potential loss of shrimp.  A simulation modeling technique is used
which estimates the changes in landings, revenues, costs, and the economic
rents.  A base scenario in which no TEDs are used is compared with five
different scenarios where the TED is used by vessels in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The analysis was based on a single year impact.  The implementation of the TED
comes with costs to the vessel owners and crew in the Gulf of Mexico.  Since
the implementation of the TEDs does cause negative rent, it is a certainty,
all other things remaining equal, that some vessel owners and crew will leave
the industry.  The number to leave the industry will depend on how effective
they are at learning to use the TED effectively.

Shrimp Fleet.""  Fishery Bulletin , 74(2):301-309.
The 115 Gulf of Mexico shrimp vessels used in this study were grouped
into classes I (larger vessels) through V (smaller vessels) based on their
type of construction, length of keel, and index of effort.  In 1973, class II
vessels were the only vessels able to register a positive return to owner's
labor and management, $560; the other four classes registered negative
returns.  The payback period occurred during the eighth year due to the sale
of the vessels in classes II, III, and V, whereas payback did not occur for
classes I and IV.  A positive rate of return on investment was experienced by
the vessels in classes II, III, and V in the amount of 13.21, 2.65, and 2.63%,
respectively.  The internal rate of return on investment was negative for251vessels in classes I and IV.
Input prices increased some 20% from 1973 to 1974 whereas production
remained approximately constant and ex-vessel shrimp prices were lower.  Thus,
none of the classes of vessels would have experienced a break-even cash flow
for 1974.  Increasing input cost another 10% above the 1974 level, and
assuming normal production, the average vessel in class II seems to be
operating at a better than a break-even level in 1975 assuming ex-vessel
shrimp prices remain constant at 1973 levels.  Classes I, III, IV, and V
experienced less than break-even cash flows under the same conditions in 1975.

Bioeconomic Model of Shrimp Maricultural Systems in the U.S.A."" 
Ecological Modelling , 25:47-68.
A general conceptual model of a marine shrimp farming system
representing important relationships between the engineering design of
facilities, the environmental and managerial factors affecting shrimp growth
and survival, and the factors affecting production costs and profit is
presented.  Based upon this conceptual model, a bioeconomic simulation model
is developed to assess the economic feasibility of a projected penaeid shrimp
maricultural operation along the Texas coast, and to evaluate the effects of252changes in an important managerial variable rate of water flow, on the
biological and economic productivity of the system.
The conceptual model consists of five interconnected parts including
environmental, production, engineering, marketing, and profit submodels.  The
bioeconomic simulation model is coded in FORTRAN to simulate system behavior
with a daily time step on a digital computer.
Results of simulations of a projected penaeid shrimp maricultural
operation along the Texas coast suggest that such an operation would be
marginally economically feasible when based upon the particular assumptions of
this study.  Baseline simulations predict a mean annual profit of US $275 per
acre with a standard deviation of US $122 per acre, which represents a 2%
chance of economic loss.  The predicted annual return on investment is 4.5%.
The role of modelling in development of shrimp maricultural systems in
the United States is discussed.

the design modifications.  Of the four parameters, the pond shape is the most
influential over the range considered (from 17% to 8%).  Pond size is the
second most important parameter (from 17% to 21%).  Levee width and canal bank
slope influence are of lesser importance (<1% change).

particular periods of time, changes in count size regulations, or both.  The
analyses were conducted using the General Bioeconomic Fishery Simulation Model

Texas shrimp fishery.  Impacts were estimated both for the first year and for
a long run situation, that gave the industry time to adjust by increasing or
decreasing the number of bay boats and Gulf vessels.

The report investigates the possibilities of developing an individual
transferable quota system for the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery.  If industry
cooperation can be developed through a comanagement system, then the potential
for generating substantial net benefits for the fishery and the nation exist
through the increase in harvesting sector profits, declines in bycatch of
endangered species, and the increase in production of finfish in commercial
and recreational fisheries for bycatch finfish species.  However, substantial
changes will have to occur in the shrimp fishery institutions that presently
exist.  For example, a credit card system to record landings and price
information through a central clearing house will have to be implemented and
fishermen organizations will have to be developed by the industry.

Analysis of Texas Shrimp Season Closures.""  A draft and revisions
submitted to the Marine Fisheries Review .
Management of the Texas penaeid shrimp fishery is aimed at increasing
revenue from brown shrimp ( Penaeus aztecus ) landings and decreasing the level
of discards.  Since 1960 Texas has closed its territorial sea for 45 to 60
days during peak migration of brown shrimp to the Gulf of Mexico.  In 1981,
the closure was extended to 200 miles to include the U.S. Exclusive Economic
Zone.  In this study, simulation modeling was used to estimate the changes in
landings, revenue, costs, and economic rent attributable to the Texas closure. 
Four additional analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of closing the
Gulf 1-4 fathom zone for 45 to 60 days, with and without effort redirected to
inshore waters.  Distributional impacts were analyzed in terms of costs,
revenues, and rents, by vessel class, shrimp species, vessel owner, and crew.
Two problems with the theoretical discussion of the model appear to
exist in the article.  The movement along the preclosure yield curve should
actually occur on the post closure yield curve.  This leads to an incorrect
interpretation of short run rent generated by the regulation.  That is, effort
increases prior to the management regulation.  Secondly, the costs curves are
incorrectly defined.  The equilibriums and the resulting interpretations of
rent appear to be different for each curve.

estimates the changes in landings, revenues, costs, and ultimately, economic
rents (profits to the fishery taking into account all costs including
opportunity costs of fishing) attributable to the fishery under the various
management alternatives set forth.  The simulation model is programmed to
depict the average fishery conditions for the period 1963-1980.  This is based
on average patterns and levels of fishing effort for this period under average
environmental conditions and the model generates average landings for the same
period for comparison to actual data.

The wage rate a person receives depends not only on the wage offered (a
function of his market characteristics), but also on his job-search strategy. 
The higher his wage demands, the higher the wage he can expect, though the
probability of finding an adequate job is lower.  When comparing wages of
different population groups, one must take their different search policies
into account.  Ignoring these differences results in a selectivity bias.  This
bias is particularly relevant for the secondary labor groups; it may distort
our conclusions about male-female and white-nonwhite wage differentials, the
age-earning profiles, the rate of return and the rate of depreciation of human
capital, and the determinants of labor-force participation.

This packet of material provides facts and figures about the 1987
seafood products of the Gulf and south Atlantic states of Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
and Texas.  This is an updated version of a packet originally based on 1984
data.  To identify trends, the 1984 data is frequently referenced after
providing the 1987 data.  Data on landings and value of catch, their relation
to the U.S. total, unique attributes of the region's species, the impact they
contribute to the nation's economy, and a discussion of the people producing
the products and the gear they use is included in the first section.  Also
included is an overview of present and projected seafood consumption.  This is
followed by a summary of the importance and characteristics of the seafood257industry in each of the nine states that form the Gulf and south Atlantic
region.

""Organization and Management of a Gulf of Mexico and South
Atlantic Ocean Fishery By-Catch Management Program.""  Gulf and
South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation, Inc., Lincoln
Center, Suite 669, 5401 West Kennedy Boulevard, Tampa, Florida,
April.
This one year project provided for the initiation of research designed
to gather information which will eventually lead to the successful reduction
of finfish bycatch in the shrimp fishery.  Such a result is ecologically and
economically beneficial to the industry, the region, and the Nation. 
Successful completion of a bycatch reduction program will economically benefit
the shrimp industry and other fisheries affected by the incidental mortality
that occurs in the shrimp fishery, and have a positive ecological impact on
the marine faunal community that inhabits the shrimp grounds.

Award NA47FF0008, Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development
Foundation, Inc., Lincoln Center, Suite 669, 5401 West Kennedy
Boulevard, Tampa, Florida, March.
To garner otherwise unobtainable information, and thus enhance the
reliability of management strategies, observers aboard voluntarily
participating commercial shark vessels documented a sample catch and effort of
the southeast U.S. commercial shark longline fishery.  With only two years of
data, no conclusive trends can be determined concerning the health of the
shark stock, but given that much of the catch inside 10-15 fathoms is immature
fish or pregnant females, continued fishing pressure in nearshore (<10 fm)
waters may have substantial negative impacts on the stock; to the long term
detriment of the stock and fishery.  Excluding these nearshore efforts,
recruitment to the fishery is substantial by the time the fish are 135 cm FL
(12 years of age).  Based on this age structure, a minimum size limit of
perhaps 140 cm FL for sandbar sharks might be an appropriate management
measure.  Very preliminary estimates indicate that with such measures, which
would equal approximately a 10% reduction in quota, the sandbar shark stock
could increase in numbers with continued fishing.

The proposed action will result in management of the shark and other
elasmobranch in the U.S. Fishery Conservation Zone (FCZ) under the
jurisdiction of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council.  The basic
objective will be to manage these stocks for their optimum yield.  Specific
objectives are to minimize foreign fishing bycatch and mortality of species
other than sharks for which no surplus (TALFF) is available.  Maximize the
benefits derived by domestic fishermen from the shark and other elasmobranch
resource.  Minimize conflicts among the participants in the shark fishery and
other fisheries in the FCZ.  Establish a data collection system which will
provide the information necessary for future management of the fishery. 
Recognizing that a surplus exists in the fishery and that it is an
underutilized resource, a long term objective shall be support of a fishery
development program.

This DSEIS addresses the issue that shrimp trawls have a significant
bycatch of nontarget species of finfish, most of which are discarded dead. 
Consequently, fisheries directed at the discarded species and other fauna may
be adversely affected and ecosystem diversity may be reduced.  Red snapper is
one species documented to be overfished and unable to recover because of the
unacceptably high mortality of juveniles taken incidentally in shrimp trawls. 263Alternatives are presented that will reduce bycatch.  Because BRDs are not 100
percent effective, some reduced level of incidental take will continue to
occur.  A reduction or loss of shrimp through the BRD also may occur.  The
amount of shrimp loss is dependent on the type of BRD used and the operation
of the trawl and vessel.  In areas not directly affected by this action (i.e.,
state controlled waters), the fishery may continue to take incidental catch. 
Ecological modeling suggests that the use of the three most effective BRDs
will result in a decline in shrimp biomass ranging from 5.9 to 8.2 percent
(Martinez et al. 1966) as a result of increased predation and a reduction in
available nutrients for recycling.  The subsequent effect on shrimp landings
is unknown because over the fast five years natural variability in landings
has averaged about 12 percent.  However, the impact of BRDs on the shrimp
fishery in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be substantial ranging from 3.6
billion to -1.6 billion dollars.  The expected preferred BRD that achieve the
bycatch reduction target of 50 percent should reduce the value of the shrimp
fishery by 280 million dollars.

The western Gulf stone crab ( Menippe  adina) ranges in coastal waters
from northwest Florida around the Gulf of Mexico to the state of Tamaulipus,
Mexico.  Currently, M. adina supports small, directed commercial fisheries in
Louisiana and Texas.  In Mississippi and Alabama, the fishery exists as a
limited, seasonal bycatch component of the blue crab ( Callinectes  sapidus )
fishery.  High dockside value of stone crab claws and an apparently
unsatisfied market demand have created interest in further development of
commercial fisheries for stone crabs.  The goal of this document is to provide
a data base for use in development of management measures.  The objectives are
to summarize available literature, data, and regulations pertaining to the
western Gulf stone crab and to describe the fishery.

The management of marine fisheries presents a complex mixture of
biological, economic, social, and political problems.  In recent years this
subject has earned increasing attention owing both to the growing pressures on
the world fish stocks, and to the general concern with the proper use of the
environment, of which the rational harvesting of fish in the sea is an269important special case.

of the Fish Resources of the North Atlantic.""  J. Cons. Int.
Explor. Mer. , 40(1):8-16.
Long-term benefits from improved fishery management can be placed in
four classes - greater gross value of the catch; reduced costs of capture;
better allocation of benefits, e.g. between different regions, or different
sections of the community; and reduced administrative and similar burdens. 
These benefits are discussed in general terms, and in relation to the value of
the North Sea fisheries.  Though the volume of the catch from the North Sea
has more than doubled in the last 20 years, the value (at fixed prices) has
probably not changed much.  Different patterns of fishing might increase the
value of the North Sea catch by 50% or more.  The total net benefits from
better management of the northeast Atlantic fisheries might be a billion
dollars annually.

In an unmanaged fishery the costs of catching a unit weight of fish will
tend to rise until they are equal to the value of the catch.  There is likely
to be an excessive amount of fishing that adds to the costs, but adds little
or nothing to the total catch, and may even decrease it.  In practice the
amount of fishing will often exceed the equilibrium, due to delays in reacting
to falling catch rates, year to year fluctuation in the fishery, etc.  The
labor and capital engaged in fishing is often relatively immobile, and once
excess capacity has developed it is not easily reduced without special
measures.  A number of different measures are available to control both the
amount of fishing and the sizes of the fish caught.  These are outlined, and
the advantages and disadvantages briefly discussed.  Several of the methods of
controlling the amount of fishing tend to add to unit costs, and therefore
offer little long term benefits.  These benefits can only be assured by
control of the total capacity engaged in a fishery, such as through allocation
of shares to individual countries in an international fishery, or by license
limitation in a national fishery.

Endogeneity in Random Utility Models of Recreational Demand.   Draft,
Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Maryland, College
Park, MD, January, 24 pp.
Modeling the choice among a discrete set of recreation alternatives is
driven by the possible patterns of substitution among sites.  Researchers
typically assume that the individual s choice set is the same as the set of
alternatives included in the recreation survey instrument.  This need not be
the case.  We derive a generalization of the standard multinomial logit random
utility model which allows for the possibility of heterogeneous choice sets
that are endogenously determined in the model.  The possible biases introduced
by erroneously specifying each individual s choice set are investigated in two
examples.  Using these examples, we show that parameter and compensating
variation estimates differ greatly between the endogenous choice set model and
the traditional logit model.  The new endogenous choice set model is shown to
be manageable for a small number of alternatives, and two examples provide
grounds for optimism in further applications of the model.

Analysis of agricultural production generally ignores the undesirable
outputs (such as nitrate or pesticide contamination of water) that are
produced alongside desirable, marketable outputs.  This paper presents the
results of research which integrates a simple physical model of nitrate
leaching from dairy production into a multiple input/multiple output
representation of the production technology: the output distance function. 
Estimation of the output distance function as a frontier allows for the
derivation of shadow prices of the undesirable output which can be interpreted
as the marginal abatement costs that each producer faces.  The study uses an
unbalanced panel data set derived from annual survey returns from 330
individual UK dairy farms which span the period 1982 to 1992 and totals to
2130 observations.  The shadow price for the undesirable output evaluated at
the mean of the data is estimated to be -29.34 Pounds Sterling.

A model of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) fishery is developed and used
to explore the likely biological and economic consequences of adopting various
management programs for the fishery.  Issues addressed include both regional
and international aspects since SBT are exploited by Japanese and New Zealand
fishermen as well as their Australian counterparts.  Simulation results from
the model suggest that there exists an annual sustainable level of catch on
the part of Australian and Japanese fishermen which would maintain fish stocks
at a  safe  level but this level of catch, as well as its composition, is not
unique so that there is room for negotiation between the major fishing nations
on a mutually agreeable management program; that the effects of heavy fishing
of younger fish early in their migratory path has disproportionate
consequences for all other users of the resource; and that there exists some
scope for some form of socially acceptable tradeoff between biological and
economic objectives.

In Solving Bycatch, Considerations for Today and Tomorrow , Alaskan Sea
Grant College Program Report No. 96-03, University of Alaska, Fairbanks,
Alaska, 322 pp.
A brief analysis is made of the strategies that can be used to reduce
bycatches in fisheries.  They fall under two basic types: reduction of the
level of effort, and reduction of the average bycatch per unit of effort
(BPUE).  The former frequently results in lower catches of the target species. 
Reduction in BPUE, on the other hand, may offer a way to mitigate the problems
with fewer negative impacts on the fisheries.  Identifying the environmental,
biological, and technological reasons why bycatches happen is the key point of
those strategies that attempt to deal with the problems while at the same time
maintaining the use of the resources involved.  Five  lines of defense  are
identified to try to mitigate or solve bycatch problems.  The Tuna-Dolphin
Program of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, is used as a case
study to illustrate different issues.  Finally, some of the conditions that
have helped solve this problem are presented.  Even though it is clear that
each fishery will have to develop its own set of solutions, there are some
common traits that may help in the search for solutions.

This paper describes the nature and sources of uncertainty faced by the
economist attempting to analyze alternative policies for management of
agricultural nonpoint source pollution of ground water.  Since the nature of
the nonpoint problem makes many of the techniques used to control point source
pollutants infeasible, approaches to the ground water problem often involve a
modeling component to simulate both physical movement of agricultural
chemicals and decision making of economic units.  This paper focuses primarily
on how uncertainty affects this modeling process.

Stackelberg Equilibria and Social Coordination in a Share Contract
Fishery."" Marine Resource Economics , 3(3):209-235.
A general dynamic model of fishing under harvest share contracts is
developed.  Vessel owners hire fishermen to work on the vessels and pay them a
share of the catch and an additional wage.  The harvest rate depends on labor
input, capital input, and stock level.  Neither of the agents is unionized. 
On each vessel we have a principal agent setting where the crews  labor input
decisions and vessel owners  decisions about harvest shares are based on
myopic optimization.  However, in this first analysis of the model risk is not
included in the formulation.  The paper concentrates on the incentive effects
and in this framework the reason for a share contract to exist is the
avoidance of transaction costs.  In a share contract fishery both labor input
and resource use are inefficient.  A detailed analysis of the effectiveness of
different regulation policies is presented.274Hamalainen, Raimo P., Jukka Ruusunen, and Veijo Kaitala (1990). 
""Cartels and Dynamic Contracts in Sharefishing."" Journal of
Environmental Economics and Management , 19:175-192.
This paper studies a principal-agent model of a fishery, where
cooperative vessel owners hire unorganized fishermen to operate the vessels. 
On each vessel fishermen's remuneration is a share of the value of the catch. 
The results show that harvest shares  of myopic fishermen will be reduced when
cartels are established.  Intertemporal optimization of the resource use by
the cartel is accompanied by the problem of the cartel's viability.  Share
contracts are traditionally motivated by risk sharing and by the avoidance of
labor monitoring.  The results of this paper suggest new important reasons for
the commonness of share contracts in fishing.  Sharefishing is a self-adaptive
and time consistent remuneration system as it automatically accommodates
differences in individual crews' labor supplies due to differences in
fishermen's skills and cost factors.  An essential result found that supports
harvest sharing is the relative simplicity of the social management policy;
optimal regulation is accomplished by a constant subsidy on the price of fish. 
The subsidy policy is time consistent and does not change as the stock level
changes.  The paper also addresses conditions under which stock extinction
does not occur in sharefishing.

pp.
The focus of the study was Hawaii s 1995-1996 small pelagic fishery. 
Vessel owners and operators were surveyed through both in-person and mail-back
surveys.  Information was obtained on 569 small boat fishermen.  Data includes
information on vessel operations and characteristics, investment and fixed
costs, trip costs, annual catches, sales and gross revenue, as well as
operator demographics.  Surveys were stratified into four groups based on
fishermen s motivations and reliance on fishing income: full-time fishermen
were defined as those who reported receiving over 50% of their income from
fishing profits, part-time fishermen received 50% or less of their income from
fishing, expense fishermen sold fish only to cover trip costs, and
recreational fishermen did not sell any part of their catch over the previous
12 months.  Clear differences were evident among groups.  Fishing intensity
(number of trips taken over the previous 12 months), catch, and gross revenue
were all found to decrease as operators  reliance on fishing income decreased
(from full-time to recreational).  A majority of fishermen reported using more
than one gear type, however, full-time fishermen reported doing more
handlining relative to trolling when compared to other groups.  Average trip
costs were similar across groups, with full-time fishermen spending more on
ice and bait than others.  An examination of the data on pelagic vessels by
vessel length was also carried out.  Sixty-six percent of the completed
surveys belonged to vessels between 16 and 24 feet in length overall.  In
general, investment, costs, and catches rose along with vessel size. 
Operators of larger vessels reported a greater emphasis on handlining than did
smaller vessels but all sizes utilized multiple gear types during the previous
12 months.

While the Hawaii longline fleet averaged a positive net return from their 1993
operations, the level of profits varied substantially between groups of
vessels.  When analyzed by target species, mixed target vessels earned the
highest net return.  Although the gross revenue earned by this group was less
than that earned by swordfish vessels, mixed vessels had somewhat lower
variable costs and substantially lower fixed costs.

and Planning Implications for Global Climate Change in the Pacific
Basin, Pacific Basin Development Council, UH Social Science
Research Institute.
This paper outlines the approach developed to address the five public
policy problems associated with global climate change in the Pacific Islands;
i.e. (1) the potential impacts of global climate change could be so
catastrophic that neither our policy makers nor the people we serve want to
consider the possibility; (2) compared to other policy issues, the potential
impacts of global warming appear much less immediate; (3) Pacific Island
countries and territories do not contribute even a fraction of global
emissions of greenhouse gases, and laws or domestic policies developed in the
islands to restrict emissions would have little or no impact on the
intensification of the greenhouse effect; (4) the lack of scientific certainty
about the relationships between emissions and global warming and between
warming and other environmental changes allows policy makers to dismiss the
problem; (5) policy makers have been provided with little guidance about what
they could possibly do about the global climate change and its impacts.  It is
organized in terms of those policy problems and concludes with a brief
description of the methods to be employed in the pilot project.

In practice, complete demand systems are not estimated.  Rather, either
an incomplete demand system is estimated, or separability is invoked and a
partial demand system is estimated.  This paper considers the relationship
between the conventional compensating variation (equivalent variation) and the
corresponding welfare measure that can be derived from a partial demand system
and the current budget allocation to the separable group.  Even assuming the
separability assumption invoked is appropriate, these partial measures
provide, in general, only a limited amount of information about the
compensating variation and no information about the equivalent variation. 
Great care is therefore needed when using partial welfare measures to evaluate
policy.

Damage Assessment: Economic Implications for Fisheries
Management.""  American Journal of Agricultural Economics ,
75(5):1188-1193
This paper considers similarities and contrasts between the economic
concepts and procedures used in connection with natural resources damages
assessment and those that arise in connection with fisheries management.  The
more significant point that we make is the requirement for a consistent
approach to economic valuation, to eliminate opportunities for mistakes in the277economic analysis and to provide a coherent economic argument for politicians,
bureaucrats, and the public.  The problem arises because of the fragmentation
in the legal and political setting within which economic analysis is conducted
and the fact that these different entities have different viewpoints and adopt
different guidelines.

Access to Marine Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on Conservation , Center

Successful common property resource management systems are based on
effective control.  Effective control of the exploitation of natural resource
systems is often extremely difficult to obtain due to underlying ecological
uncertainty, resource scale, heterogeneity of users, diverse objectives, high
coordination and enforcement costs, and a lack of understanding about
organizational structure and process.  These difficulties often lead to
attempts to manage by  technical expertise  to obtain  efficient  solutions. 
Co-management, as power sharing between government agencies and user groups,
is a mechanism for realizing effective control.  Co-management extends beyond
the efficiency objective to encompass legitimacy and equity.  Structuring co-
management requires investment in human capital of scientists, decision
makers, and user groups to build required skills of coordination and
negotiation.  The history of a fishery and its existing institutions-both
formal and informal-influence the probability of co-management success.  This
paper focuses on the benefits and costs of co-management; its necessary
conditions as well as its vulnerabilities.  Some key aspects of building a co-
management process are identified and compared to other management processes.

First, the optimal harvesting of a single cohort is discussed, assuming
that a unit of fishing effort always removes a constant proportion of the fish
stock.  Discounting is shown to imply a longer fishing season, and only in
special cases should the stock be depleted to an uneconomic level as quickly
as possible.  Then the relative merits of periodic and sustained fishing of a
stock consisting of several cohorts are studied by simulating a Beverton-Holt
model of a cod fishery.  The impact of cost, discounting, and natural
fluctuations on the time-pattern of fishing is discussed, as well as the
practicability of periodic fishing.

Theoretical and Empirical Analysis.""  Can. J. fish. Aquat. Sci.

The traditional fishing effort approach to fisheries economics implies
the existence of a production function with fishing effort and fish abundance
as independent variables.  The existence of bionomic equilibrium depends on278the shape of this production function, as well as the demand and effort cost
functions.  The fishing effort approach is integrated with neoclassical
production function analysis where labor and capital produce an effort
frontier production function that can be estimated for selected Norwegian
fisheries.  Optimal vessel size and capital intensity can be estimated. 
Fishing vessels appear to be undersized but not too capital intensive.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1983).  ""Optimal Harvesting of Ecologically
Interdependent Fish Species.""  Journal of Environmental Economics
and Management , 10:329-345.
The optimal exploitation of a two-species predator-prey system is
considered, using Lotka-Volterra type equations.  Due to the density
dependence of ecological efficiency, both species should be harvested
simultaneously over a range of relative prices.  Beyond the limits of this
price range, either the prey species should be utilized indirectly by
harvesting the predator, or the predator should be eliminated to maximize the
prey yield.  Neglecting harvesting costs, the simultaneous harvest of prey and
predators requires that a unit of prey biomass increase in value by being
""processed"" by predators.  Certain results from single species fishery models
are shown not to apply to multispecies models.  These are as follows: (i)
Optimal regulation of a free access fishery may call for subsidizing instead
of taxing the harvest of predator species.  (ii) Increasing the discount rate
may, at ""moderate"" levels, imply that the optimal standing stock of biomass
increases instead of decreasing. (iii) a rising price of a falling cost per
unit fishing effort of a species may raise and not lower the optimal standing
stock of that species.

This paper explores likely changes in the types and extent of
uncertainty resulting from increased regulation of fisheries.  Specifically,
fisheries management may be a principal source of uncertainty, and
institutional uncertainty may be substituted for the uncertainty of nature.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1985).  ""The Effects of a Fishermen's Monopoly in
the Market for Unprocessed Fish.""  Marine Resource Economics ,
2(1):75-85.
This paper considers the effects of granting a fishermen's sales
organization exclusive rights to sell unprocessed fish.  On the assumption
that the fishermen's monopoly is able to discriminate between plants and end
use alternatives in its pricing policy, the conditions for profit maximization
are derived and compared with the conditions for social efficiency.  It is
found that the monopoly would be efficient if its costs for obtaining the fish
are identical to the social costs, the marginal processing cost is constant,
and either the price of the finished product is constant or the product is
exported so that consumer's surplus is not a part of the social benefit.  A
fishermen's monopoly may thus achieve the objectives of an export cartel. 
When the marginal processing cost is rising the monopoly will over conserve
the fish resource, provided that its cost of providing the fish is not
sufficiently below the social cost.  Finally, the analysis is extended to the
special case in which processors have established a price discriminating
monopoly in the market for the finished products but distribute the resulting
profit through higher accounting prices while leaving individual processors to
decide how much fish to buy for processing.  This system passes the benefits
from price discrimination in the markets for finished products on to the
fishermen's monopoly.279Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1985).  ""Inefficiency Through Government
Regulations: The Case of Norway s Fishery Policy.""  Marine
Resource Economics , 2(2):115-141.
The fishery is a classic example of market failure.  Government
intervention does not necessarily correct this, but may instead seek
economically inefficient solutions, because of either a deliberate trade off
between efficiency and equity or political expediency.  Norway s fishery
policy is seen as a case in point.  Its stated objectives put a low priority
on economic efficiency, while various objectives based on equity are put in
the foreground.  The result is that the contribution of Norway s fisheries to
the national income is slight.  Norway s fishery policy consists of two
largely uncoordinated parts, one concerned with maintaining fishermen s
incomes and the other with managing fish stocks.
Since the introduction of the 200 mile limit, most fish stocks exploited
by Norway have been managed by total allowable catches (TACs).  While this has
prevented the depletion of fish stocks, the regulations introduced to enforce
the TACs have been an economic failure.  The setting of TACs has in some cases
revealed a willingness to attain solutions expedient in the short term at the
expense of long term benefits.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1986).  ""The Effect of the Discount Rate on the
Optimal Exploitation of Renewable Resources.""  Marine Resource
Economics , 3(4):319-329.
In a recent paper, Farzin (1984) has shown that the impact of the
discount rate on the optimal rate of depletion of an exhaustible resource is
ambiguous.  Since Clark s (1973) paper on the extinction of animal species, it
has been recognized that a higher discount rate increases the optimal rate of
exploitation and increases the likelihood of extinction, but ignores the
capital cost implication of a higher discount rate; the effect discussed by
Farzin.  In this paper, the effect of the discount rate on the optimal rate of
exploitation and standing stock of a renewable resource such as fish is
examined.  This effect is ambiguous with the ambiguity depending on the dual
role of the discount rate.  On the one hand, the discount rate expresses a
required rate of return on a growing asset.  For a renewable resource with a
concave growth function, a higher rate of discount implies a smaller standing
stock.  Ont the other hand, the discount rate expresses the opportunity cost
of capital to be invested in harvesting equipment.  A higher discount rate
thus means more costly harvesting, which in turn implies a less intensive
optimal harvesting and a larger standing stock.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1987).  ""Optimal Catch Capacity and Fishing
Effort in Deterministic and Stochastic Fishery Models.""  Fisheries
Research , 5:1-21.
This paper is a survey of fisheries economics aimed mainly at fisheries
biologists.  The paper begins by reviewing the static theory, which
established two major results. (I) Free access leads to over-exploitation, and
(ii) the optimal rate of exploitation is less than the maximum sustainable
yield.  The latter could be regarded as an antithesis to the biological
doctrine that fish stocks should be managed to give maximum sustainable yield
(MSY).
Dynamic theory, which is considered next, showed that the optimal rate
of exploitation could be either less or greater than the MSY rate.  In
particular, a higher discount rate was shown to imply a higher rate of
exploitation.  This, however, ignores the role of capital invested in the
harvesting sector.  Once it is recognized that a higher discount rate implies
a higher required rate of return on capital, the impact of the discount rate280on the optimal rate of exploitation becomes ambiguous.  The paper examines the
impact of the discount rate with and without stock-dependent harvesting costs. 
This leads on to the question o how the risk of extinction under free access
depends on the sensitivity of unit harvesting costs, or catch per unit of
effort, to the size of the exploited stock.
Finally, stochastic fishery models are briefly considered.  The main
purpose of this part of the paper is to demonstrate that deterministic fishery
models may give poor guidance for managing the stochastic fisheries of the
real world, even if risk neutrality and constant prices are assumed.  To
demonstrate this as clearly as possible, the unit cost of harvesting is
assumed to be constant, implying that the optimal rate of exploitation is
constant in a deterministic model.  First, we consider the simple case of
time-invariant stochastic catch quotas (no population dynamics), and
demonstrate how optimal catch capacity depends on the cost of investing in the
necessary equipment.  Then we consider population dynamics, where expected
future catch quotas depend on how much is being taken presently.  Optimal
catch capacity depends on the cost of investment in this case as well, but the
derivation of optimal harvesting and investment policies becomes more
complicated.
Hannesson, R. (1988).  ""Fixed or Variable Catch Quotas?  The Importance
of Population Dynamics and Stock Dependent Costs.""  Marine
Resource Economics , 5(4):415-432.
This article considers two questions concerning fluctuations in fish
stocks and catches: are they possible beneficial and would fishery managers
opt for a strategy that enhances stock or catch quota variability or both? 
For this analysis, three models are followed: in the first, variations in
stock abundance are stochastic with no population dynamics; in the second, the
stock in a certain time period depends on a stochastic recruitment to the
stock and survivors from the previous time period; and the third is a year
class model that has more complicated population dynamics but is more
realistic.  The article implicitly assumes that property rights exist by using
profit maximizing mathematical techniques.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1993).  ""Enclosure of the Commons: Two
Paradoxes.""  Presented at the International Conference on
Fisheries Economics, Os, Norway, May 26-28.
de Meza and Gould (1992) show that the rent from enclosing a free access
resource may, at the wage rate prior to enclosure, be positive while the
social benefit is negative.  Hence there may be an incentive to privatize a
common resource even when this is not warranted for reasons of efficiency. 
Books and Heijdra (1990) have criticized Buchanan (1980) for a similar
approach when demonstrating that the potential benefits of enclosing the
commons may be dissipated through rent seeking.  In this paper we show that de
Meza and Gould's conclusion that the rent from enclosure will be higher than
the social benefit at the free access wage rate still holds when there is a
real cost of the enclosure and diminishing returns in both sectors of the
economy.  It may, however, happen that the resource rent after enclosure is
negative while the social benefit of enclosure is positive.  Hence we might
end up in the curious situation that neither free access nor enclosure is an
equilibrium.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1993).  ""Fishing Capacity and Harvest Rules."" 
Marine Resource Economics , 8(2):133-143.
In this note we consider the choice of optimum fishing capacity for fish
stocks that vary at random.  In models with stochastic variations of fish281stocks, optimum fishing capacity is normally a decision variable separate from
fishing effort.  It is shown how the optimum fishing capacity depends on the
price of fish, the cost of capacity, and the  harvest rule  linking the
permitted catch to the size of the fish stock.  Operating costs may also
influence the optimum capacity through the effect of stock  thinning  on the
cost per unit of fish caught and the level at which further depletion becomes
unprofitable.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1994).  ""Optimum Fishing Capacity and
International Transfer of Excess Allowable Catches.""  Land
Economics , 70(3):330-344.
This paper considers optimum fleet capacity for fish stocks that vary
randomly and are managed by separate states.  Assigning a particular fleet to
a particular stock will be less profitable than allowing fleets to move
between stocks.  Transfer of excess catch quotas between states improves
profitability, but produces a global optimum only if payments are attached to
the transfer.  A free transfer of excess quotas results in overcapacity and
dissipation of rents.  A Nash bargaining solution with respect to transfer
prices, but without side payments, gives solutions very close to the global
optimum.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1997).  ""Fishing as a Supergame.""  Journal of
Environmental Economics and Management , 32:309-322.
This paper considers how cooperative solutions to games of sharing fish
resources can be supported by threat strategies.  With highly mobile fish
stocks, the number of agents compatible with a cooperative self-enforcing
solution is not very high for reasonable values of the discount rate, but
sensitive to changes in the discount rate and costs and to cost heterogeneity. 
With migrating stocks, where growth and reproduction depend on how much all
agents leave behind after harvesting, the likelihood of a cooperative, self-
enforcing equilibrium is increased.  With a dominant player and a competitive
fringe the rents and optimum stock level of the dominant player fall quickly
as the share of the competitive fringe increases.

Trade in Fishery Products?   Discussion paper prepared for the FAO E-

School of Economics and Business Administration, Bergen, Norway, 7 pp.
The subject of international trade is controversial and at times
emotional.  Yet the theory of international trade, its generation of economic
benefits and its impact on their distribution is well developed and
uncontroversial.  The generation and the distribution of gains from fish trade
can be in unexpected directions, as they depend critically on how well
countries manage their fish resources.  Countries that do so badly or not at
all are more likely than not to lose from trading in fish; opening up trade is
like opening up a waste disposal bin into which productive resources will be
thrown to little or no good purpose.  If on the other hand such countries were
to import fish as a result of trade they might in fact gain; lower fish prices
would lower the temptation to waste resources.  The need for fish exporting
countries to manage their fisheries prudently can hardly be overstated.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur (1998).  ""Marine Reserves: What Would They
Accomplish?""  Marine Resource Economics , 13(3):159-170.
A marine reserve is defined as a subset of the area over which a fish
stock is dispersed and closed to fishing.  This paper investigates what will282happen to fishing outside the marine reserve and to the stock size in the
entire area as a result of establishing a marine reserve.  Three regimes are
compared: (i) open access to the entire area, (ii) open access to the area
outside the marine reserve, and (iii) optimum fishing in the entire area.  Two
models are used: (i) a continuous-time model, and (ii) a discrete-time model,
both using the logistic growth equation.  Both models are deterministic
equilibrium models.  The conservation effect of a marine reserve is shown to
be critically dependent on the size of the marine reserve and the migration
rate of fish.  A marine reserve will increase fishing costs and
overcapitalization in the fishing industry, to the extent that it has any
conservation effect on the stock, and in a seasonal fishery it will shorten
the fishing season.  For stocks with moderate to high migration rates, a
marine reserve of a moderate size will have only a small conservation effect,
compared with open access to the entire area inhabited by a stock.  The higher
the migration rate of fish, the larger the marine reserve must be in order to
achieve a given level of stock conservation.  A marine reserve of an
appropriate size would achieve the same conservation effect as optimum
fishing, but with a smaller catch.
Hannesson, Rognvaldur and Stein Ivar Steinshamn (1991).  ""How to Set
Catch Quotas: Constant Effort or Constant Catch?"" Journal of
Environmental Economics and Management , 20:71-91.
This paper considers whether the total allowable catch from a fish stock
should be a fixed annual quantity or based on constant fishing effort.  It
consists of two parts, a theoretical part and an empirical part based on data
from the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock.  In the theoretical part it is shown that
realistic cost and revenue functions have opposite effects on whether a
constant quota or a constant effort yields the highest expected profit.  A
concave revenue function implies that a constant quota will be preferable,
while a stock dependent unit cost of landed fish has the opposite implication. 
The empirical part investigates how large the difference between the average
profit yielded by the two strategies is likely to be, on the basis of some
stylized facts about the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock.  The size of this stock
fluctuates considerably over time, due mainly to fluctuations in the size of
year classes.  Spectral analysis indicates cyclical movements, and so a sine
curve was used to generate recruitment cycles.  The difference in average
profit yielded by the two harvest strategies is very small in most cases, or
of the order of 1-2%.  This result is relatively robust with respect to
alternative specifications of the cost and the revenue functions, but a
maximum difference of 20% was produced by a non-stock-dependent unit cost of
fish and a kinked revenue function, where catches exceeding a certain quantity
are worthless.

Characteristics Associated with Seafood Counters in Grocery Stores.

This study provides a benchmark analysis of seafood counter
characteristics corresponding to the peaking of per capita seafood demand in
the U.S.  Logistic regression results show separate seafood counters are less
likely in small stores, in rural stores, and in stores in low or medium income
areas.  Chain stores and stores with a significant number of non-white
customers were more likely to have a seafood counter.  Stores in the East
South Central region were less likely, and stores in New England more likely
to have a seafood counter.  The likelihood that sores will develop seafood
counters was related to differences in sales volume, floor space, urban/rural
location, income level of clients and regional location.  Continuing
innovations in marketing technology of seafood counters are likely to provide283expanded marketing opportunities in the future.

""Economic Feasibility of Shrimp Farming in Texas: An Investment
Analysis for Semi-Intensive Pond Grow-Out.""  Journal of World
Mariculture , 16:129-150.
A firm level simulation model (MARSIM) was developed to analyze the
survival of different shrimp farm sizes in Texas.  The model simulates the
annual activities of a shrimp farm: production, finances, cash receipts,
capital replacement and depreciation, cash flows, income taxes, balances, and
growth.  A firm is replicated 50 times over a 10 year planning horizon. 
Random values for shrimp growth and survival, temperature, hurricanes, and
prices received in each of 10 years are generated from multivariate empirical
probability density functions (pdf) for these variables.  For the analysis
summarized here, a shrimp farm was simulated using 3 different size systems
and 4 different pond sizes.  Results indicate that higher rates of return and
faster payback are associated with larger total farm size and larger ponds. 
For large farms (400 surface hectares), pond size becomes less critical to
obtaining an acceptable rate of return to investment.  The amount of time
taken to construct a facility significantly impacts the rate of return. 
Hurricanes, prices, production, and temperature variation are also critical
factors affecting the firm's returns and survival.

Fisheries in many countries have been demonstrated to generate super
normal profits in either the short or long run.  In the short run, such
profits may be realized when a new fishery is developed and there are
consequently few boats fishing a relatively large resource.  In an open access
fishery, these rents are normally dissipated as more vessels enter the fishery
and catch per unit effort (CPUE) falls.  If, however, the resource is large
and/or effort is limited by government regulation, super normal profits may
continue in the long run.  In this case, the government may appropriate some
of these profits as a 'resource rent'; a payment by users for the use of a
common property resource.  Examples, are widely found in the mining sector,
where the minerals are owned by the government and companies are granted
extraction rights in return for a royalty or rent.

Prawn ( Penaeus  monodon ) Culture in the Philippines, II: Grow-out
Operations.""  Asian Fisheries Science , 9: 127-141.
The dramatic fall in prawn prices coupled with environmental concerns
has resulted in a relative stagnation of prawn grow-out operations in the
Philippines.  The sector recently experienced a lack of direction and growth,
combined with crowded watersheds, excessive use of water bodies, overuse of
groundwater and continued destruction of mangrove.  A field survey of prawn
growers conducted in 1992 was used to develop economic estimates for
representative production systems: intensive, semi-intensive, extensive, and
prawn-milkfish rotation.  Existing intensive facilities can be operated
efficiently and profitably, but new intensive operations will most likely need
to include water treatment capabilities for water entering and exiting grow-287out ponds.  Canals, reservoirs, or ponds used for water quality improvement
may be able to concurrently produce a profitable crop, such as milkfish-prawn
rotation.  Internal rate of return for semi-intensive ponds using earthen
ponds was higher than for other culture systems.  If, over time, water quality
and conservation constraints are sufficiently addressed, stocking densities
might be increased.  Research and extension programs targeting equity should
focus on integrated systems.
Hausman, Jerry A. (1981).  ""Exact Consumer's Surplus and Deadweight
Loss.""  American Economic Review , 71(4): 662-676.
In this paper, the primary case of a single price change considered by
Willig, that is also the situation in which consumer surplus is often used in
applied work, no approximation is necessary.  From an estimate of the demand
curve, the exact consumer surplus can be derived whether it is the
compensating variation, equivalent variation, or some measure of utility
change.  The basic idea used in deriving the exact measure of consumer surplus
is to use the observed market demand curve to derive the unobserved
compensated demand curve.  It is this latter demand curve that leads to the
compensating variation and equivalent variation.
Hausman, Jerry A. and Daniel McFadden (1984).  ""Specification Tests for
the Multinomial Logit Model.""  Econometrica , 52(5):1219-1240.
Discrete choice models are now used in a variety of situations in
applied econometrics.  By far the model specification that is used most often
is the multinomial logit model.  Yet it is widely known that a potentially
important drawback of the multinomial logit model is the independence from
irrelevant alternatives property.  While most analysts recognize the
implications of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property, it has
remained basically a maintained assumption in applications.
In this paper we provide two sets of computationally convenient
specification tests for the multinomial logit model.  The first test is an
application of the Hausman (1978) specification test procedure.  The basic
idea for the test here is to test the reverse implication of the independence
from irrelevant alternatives property.  The test statistic is easy to compute
sine it only requires computation of a quadratic form that involves the
difference of the parameter estimates and the differences of the estimated
covariance matrices.
The second set of specification tests that we propose is based on more
classical test procedures.  We consider a generalization of the multinomial
logit model that is called the nested logit model.  Since the multinomial
logit model is a special case of the more general model when a given parameter
equals one, classical test procedures such as the Wald, likelihood ratio, and
Lagrange multiplier tests can be used.
The two sets of specification test procedures are then compared for an
example where exact and approximate comparisons are possible.

Systems Theory in Multivariate Time Series Analysis.""  Draft
report, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of
California, Davis, March, 24 pp.
An approach to modelling multivariate time series based on linear
systems theory is presented and related to more traditional econometric
methods to the advantage of both.  The linear system theory development
provides direct information on model choice, a set of exclusion restrictions
that are not sequence dependent and are stable, an extension to multiple
period forecast error tradeoffs, and a formal norm on the approximation of the
model to the observed autocovariance sequence, among other things.  The link
to econometrics, on the other hand, provides an interpretation of the
criterion underlying the estimators, the sampling theory of the resulting
estimators, and their properties, an understanding of certain (econometric)
identification issues related to these estimators and suggested improvements
based on the analysis, and straightforward tests of model order -- in addition
to relating the linear systems procedure to a body of logic familiar to
econometricians and statisticians.

This paper attempts to define what Marine Recreational Fisheries

I would like to start by making two fundamental points: 1) fisheries
development cannot be accomplished in a vacuum - it is clear that we need289responsible and good fisheries management to ensure the efficacy of
development and viability of the resource, and 2) we have got to look at
fisheries development in the recreational sector differently than we've looked
at it in the past.

Prawn Fishery.""  Occasional Paper 103, Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics, GPO Box 1563, Canberra 2601.
The northern prawn fishery has been subject to management since the
early 1970's in an attempt to control the expansion of effort and prevent the
overexploitation of the resource.  Many of the management policies developed
over this period have proved to be ineffective in controlling effort. 
Moreover, the increasing cost of management and the need to avoid costly and
ineffective measures will lead to increasing demands for analysis of the cost
effectiveness of such policies.  This report outlines the mathematical
programming model of the fishery designed to assess current and alternative
management policies on both effort and profitability.  Then the short and long
run effects of the current and alternative management policies on the fishery
are assessed.
Heaps, Terry (1995).   Density Dependent Growth and the Culling of Farmed
Fish.   Marine Resource Economics , 10(3):285-298.
The aquaculture model of Arnason (1992) is extended to allow for density
dependent growth.  It is then shown that the optimal management policy for a
fish farm may include a period in which there is culling of the stock up to a
final slaughter date when all the remaining fish are slaughtered.  Results in
Heaps (1993), who dealt with density independent growth, for the effects of
changes in model parameters on the optimal final slaughter weight are shown to
generalize to the case of density dependent growth.  As well, a numerical
example is provided where culling is definitely part of the optimal management
plan.
Heckman, James (1974).  ""Shadow Prices, Market Wages, and Labor Supply."" 
Econometrica , 42(4):679-694.
A common set of parameters that underlie the functions determining the
probability that a woman works, her hours of work, her observed wage rate, and
her asking wage or shadow price of time is derived in this paper.  Two
behavioral schedules are relied upon: the function determining the wage a
woman faces in the market (the offered wage), and the function determining the
value a woman places on her time (the asking wage).  If a woman works, her
hours of work adjust to equate these wages if she has freedom to set her
working hours.  If a woman does not work, no offered wage matches her asking
wage.  If both wage schedules are estimated, the estimated parameters can be
used to determine the probability that a woman works, her actual hours of work
given that she works, the potential market wage rates facing nonworking women,
and the implicit value of time for nonworking women.290Heckman, James (1974).  ""Sample Selection Bias as a Specification
Error."" Econometrica , 47(1):153-162.
This paper discusses the bias that results from using nonrandomly
selected samples to estimate behavioral relationships as an ordinary
specification error or omitted variables bias.  A simple consistent two stage
estimator is considered that enables analysts to utilize simple regression
methods to estimate behavioral functions by least squares methods.  The
asymptotic distribution of the estimator is derived.

This paper presents a unified treatment of statistical models for
truncation, sample selection and limited dependent variables.  A simple
estimator is proposed that permits estimation of those models by least
squares, and probit analysis.  In an empirical example, it is shown that the
estimator yields estimates close to the maximum likelihood estimates.

Hein, Stephen and Paul Meier (1995).   Skimmers: Their Development and Use in
Coastal Louisiana.   Marine Fisheries Review , 57(1):17-24.
The origin, development, and utilization of the skimmer net is reviewed
along with other historical shrimp gears used in coastal Louisiana.  The
skimmer was developed to catch white shrimp, Penaeus  setiferus , observed
jumping over the cork line (headrope) of trawls being worked in shallow
waters.  A description of the gear is presented including basic components and
various frame designs used by fishermen during its development.  The
advantages of skimmers over bottom trawls include; multiple use as both trawl
and butterfly net (wing net), ease of deployment, increased maneuverability,
reduction and greater survivability of bycatch, and ability to cover more area
due to increased speed and continuous fishing capability.  Disadvantages may
include compromising vessel stability when stored upright on the deck,
possible damage to water bottoms when improperly rigged, and limitation to a
12 foot (3.6 m) maximum depth due to size restrictions.  The growing
popularity of the skimmer net is evident by its introduction into North
Carolina and inquiries from other southeastern Atlantic and Gulf coast states.
Heinsohn, George E. (1972).  ""A Study of Dugongs (Dugong) in Northern
Queensland, Australia.""  Biological Conservation , 4(3):205-213.
 The Dugong population in the vicinity of Townsville, Queensland, has
been severely decimated as a result of a government sponsored shark netting
program begun in 1964.  Only 7 out of a total of 158 Dugongs netted from 1964
to 1971 survived drowning and were released.  Eight-two Dugongs were caught
during the first year (1964-65), after which the yearly catch has fluctuated
between 16 and 6.  Females constituted 48 (69.6 percent) of 69 sexed Dugongs291caught.  Births appear to be seasonal, occurring mainly in August and
September.  A growth curve has been constructed, making it possible to
estimate ages on the basis of body length.  Young accompany their mothers for
more than a year after birth.  Sexual maturity is attained at about 2 years of
age by both sexes.  Mature Dugongs have a total body length of 2.4 meters or
longer.  The majority of Dugongs caught after the first 14 months of shark
netting were young animals estimated to be from 1 to 3 years old.  There were
no size and sex data available for the first 14 months of netting.  Dugongs
prefer extensive protected shallow water areas where they feed selectively on
four genera of sea grasses occurring near Townsville.  Aspects of Dugong
conservation and the need for extensive ecological work discussed.
Helfand, Gloria E. and Brett W. House (1995).   Regulating Nonpoint Source
Pollution Under Heterogeneous Conditions.   American Journal of
Agricultural Economics , 77(4):1024-1032.
Because of difficulties in measuring effluent from nonpoint pollution,
proposals for regulating agricultural runoff often suggest instruments applied
to inputs or management practices.  When pollution functions vary across
sources, uniform input instruments cannot achieve a least cost pollution
reduction, but efficient instruments may be difficult to administer.  In this
paper we analyze lettuce production on two soils in California s Salinas
Valley to consider empirical costs associated with uniform input taxes and
regulations.  The results suggest that uniform instruments may mot be costly
relative to an efficient baseline.  Though taxes are more efficient, farmers
have higher profits with regulations.

Hellerstein, Daniel (1995).   Welfare Estimation Using Aggregate and

Techniques.   American Journal of Agricultural Economics , 77(3):620-630.
Due to the weak behavioral foundations of aggregate demand models, zonal
travel cost models have been largely abandoned in favor of models based on
individual observations.  However, sample selection difficulties in individual
observation models often require the use of distribution sensitive limited
dependent variables estimators.  In this paper I use Monte Carlo simulations
to investigate whether the bias form aggregation is worse than possible bias
from these narrowly specified estimators.  Somewhat surprisingly, the results
indicate that zonal models often outperform the individual observation models,
especially when using an aggregate model that incorporates intra zonal
variance of the explanatory variables.

The Faustmann rule is the major contribution of economic theory to the

in the context of a model of a forestry firm in which there is some
periodicity in the rate of harvesting over time.  This paper on the other hand292shows the Faustmann rule to be associated with socially optimal sustained
yield or steady state regimes.  In the course of so doing, attention is placed
on the role of the shadow price of a tree in the determination of an optimal
harvesting policy.

Management Policies for Reducing Shrimp Bycatch in the Gulf of
Mexico.""  North American Journal of Fisheries Management ,
forthcoming.
Every year the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fleet catches and discards millions
of pounds of finfish.  Dwindling populations of some commercially and
recreationally valuable fish species have raised concerns over the effects of
shrimp bycatch on fish stocks.  The General Bioeconomic Fisheries Simulation
model was used to estimate the changes in economic rent and bycatch of red
snapper Lutjanus  campechanus , king mackerel Scomberomorus  cavalla , and
Atlantic croaker Micropogonias  undulatus , that would result under two fishery
management policies: Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) and season/area
closures.  The BRDs were found to be more effective than closures at reducing
bycatch and also less costly to fishermen.  Under the BRD scenarios,
reductions in discards ranged from 20.2 to 42.5% for red snapper, king
mackerel discards fell approximately 89%, and Atlantic croaker discards fell
about 45%.  Under closure policies, the change in discards ranged from a 2.1
to 15% decline for red snapper, a 1.9% increase to a 39.3% decrease for king
mackerel, and a 0.1 to 12.9% decline for Atlantic croaker.  The BRD policies
produced present value 10 year rent streams (1985 US$) ranging from -$16.434
to -$27.007 million, and closure policies generated 10 year rent streams
ranging from -$35.181 to -$54.563 million.

complementary, and complementarity may be exploited to expand an industry. 
Further, uncertainty concerning skill levels may inhibit expansion.  Because
two primary objectives of agricultural extension involve facilitating skill

extension personnel.  The optimal location of transformation skills in a
sequence of operations is also studied.

The white and light meat tuna produced by the U.S. tuna industry and
consumption of tuna products by U.S. consumers is reviewed for 1985.  In
addition, the economic performance of the U.S. tropical tuna purse seine fleet
is analyzed over the period 1979-83.

and Economic Benefits in the Western Pacific United States Purse Seine
Tuna Fishery.   Marine Policy , 21(1):83-96.
Ideally, fees paid by distant water fishing nations for access to tuna
resources in exclusive economic zones would approximate the net economic value
of the tuna harvested, while leaving fishing operations profitable.  This
paper develops a linear programming approach to assess short run
profitability, optimum access fees, and net economic benefits for U.S.
tropical tuna purse seiners operating under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty. 
Results suggest that there is potential for sizable short run profits and net
economic benefits after payment of an access fee equal to the imputed marginal
value of the tuna harvested.

Cost Analysis to Fisheries Allocation Decisions: The Case of Alaska
Walleye Pollock and Pacific Cod.   North American Journal of Fisheries
Management , 14:726-741.
The controversy surrounding a proposal to allocate walleye pollock
Theragra chalcogramma  and Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus  harvested in U.S.
fisheries off Alaska is reviewed.  The walleye pollock allocation, which297generated the most concern, would apportion specific shares of the allowable
catch to each of the two harvesting sectors, inshore and offshore, along with
a set-aside for Alaska community development.  The potential transfer is of
enormous economic value for industry participants and underscores the
importance of identifying the net economic gains or losses to the nation that
might arise under the proposed allocation scheme.  For these reasons, a
benefit-cost analysis was pivotal in the allocation decisions reached by the
U.S. Department of Commerce.  The benefit-cost analysis of the allocation
proposal served to focus attention on the need for consistent social welfare
accounting, of the kind that benefit-cost analysis provides, when management
actions are evaluated.  Conceptual and practical problems associated with the
analysis are discussed as well as their solutions, and fundamental concerns
that may be peculiar to benefit-cost analysis in fisheries are specifically
noted.

Conference on Fisheries Economics, Os, Norway, May 26-28.
A revenue analysis was performed as part of a comprehensive review of
the Alaska salmon enhancement program to examine the effects of various salmon
enhancement production levels on future revenue generated to salmon fishers
working in Alaska waters.  The results were then used in a cost benefit
analysis of the state's enhancement program for sockeye, chinook, coho, chum,
and pink salmon.  Results of the revenue analysis indicate that for all
species, except pink salmon, future revenues would increase if output from
salmon enhancement were expanded.  For pink salmon, revenues would decrease if
salmon enhancement were expanded and increase if salmon enhancement were
scaled back.  However, a complete elimination of the pink hatchery program
would decrease revenues.  For all species, there are important regional
differences.
Herrmann, Mark (1993).  ""Using an International Econometric Model to

249-271.
As Alaska prices tumbled in the 1990's, Alaska's Senate Special
Committee on Domestic and International Commercial Fisheries requested a
comprehensive review of the Alaska salmon enhancement program.  As a part of
this review, a revenue analysis was performed to examine the effects of
various salmon enhancement production levels on future revenue generated to
salmon fishers working in Alaska waters.  The results were then used in a
cost/benefit analysis of the state's enhancement program for sockeye, chinook,
coho, chum, and pink salmon.  This report focuses on the two most important
Alaska salmon species, sockeye and pink.  Results of the revenue analysis
indicate that for sockeye salmon, future revenues would increase if output
from salmon enhancement were expanded.  For pink salmon, revenues would
decrease if salmon enhancement were expanded and increase if salmon
enhancement were scaled back.  However, a complete elimination of the pink
hatchery program would decrease revenues.  For both species, there are
important regional differences.
Herrmann, Mark and Joshua A. Greenberg (1994).  ""A Revenue Analysis of
the Alaska Pink Salmon Fishery."" North American Journal of
Fisheries Management , 14: 537-549.
The Alaska salmon industry is suffering from declining prices due to an
increasing supply of Salmon worldwide.  This has led to a much needed economic
evaluation of the Alaska salmon enhancement program and especially of the298hatchery system for pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha .  An econometric model
of world salmon markets was used to evaluate possible future pink salmon
enhancement production scenarios, as requested by the Alaska State Legislature
and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.  Results of this model, based on
point estimates, indicate that if pink salmon production for enhancement were
decreased, revenues to pink salmon fishers in Alaska would rise, although
there would be regional differences.  However, a complete elimination of the
Alaska salmon enhancement program would decrease revenues.
Hewett, Steven W. and Barry L. Johnson (1989).   A General Bioenergetics Model
for Fishes.   American Fisheries Society Symposium , 6:206-208.
Bioenergetics models allow fish growth or food consumption to be
estimated from a combination of laboratory and field data.  Models for many
different species of fish have been developed, with slight variations in
approach.  Our current microcomputer model merges and simplifies many of the
models that have been developed, with the hope that fisheries researchers and
managers can apply these models to questions relating to fish growth and
consumption under any given environmental or biotic conditions.  Model
documentation includes energetics parameters for a wide variety of species
that have been modeled in the past.  Other applications-specific inputs
include seasonal temperature regimes, seasonal or ontogenetic changes in
energy density, diet composition, and end points of growth over some time
interval.  Adjustments in biomass, due to biotic or abiotic factors, occur
more quickly through growth than through population density.  The growth of an
individual is an integrator of food consumption over time.  This model uses
the observed growth over some interval of time to calculate an estimate of the
prey biomass consumed over that interval under the given environmental
conditions, and thus it is a powerful tool for estimating predator impact on
prey populations.  It can also be used to predict the effect of an
environmental change on growth, or to predict the growth of fish introduced to
new conditions.

The National Marine Fisheries Service proposes to implement a regulatory

recommendations from the 1993 and 1994 meetings of the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).  Five national
quota alternatives are examined, in combination with four domestic quota
allocation alternatives, as well as three access control alternatives.  There
are clear tradeoffs between the commercial and recreational fishery in
establishing domestic quota allocations.  Overall, long term economic gains,
whether from commercial net revenues or angler consumer surplus or a
combination of the two, can only occur under short term economic losses. 
Access control alternatives address overcapitalization in the fishery and vary
widely in operation and effects on the fishery, such as equitability,
acceptability, management costs, employment, and overall economic efficiency.

Optimal harvest rates for mixed stocks of fish are calculated using
stochastic dynamic programming.  This technique is shown to be superior to the
best methods currently described in the literature.  The Ricker stock
recruitment curve is assumed for two stocks harvested by the same fishery. 
The optimal harvest rates are calculated as a function of the size of each
stock, for a series of possible parameter values.  The dynamic programming
solution is similar to the fixed escapement policy only when the two stocks
have similar Ricker parameters or when the two stocks are of equal size. 
Normally, one should harvest harder than calculated from fixed escapement
analysis.
Hilborn, Ray (1985).  ""Fleet Dynamics and Individual Variation: Why Some
People Catch More Fish than Others.""  Canadian Journal of
Fisheries and Aquatic Science  42:2-13.
Most fisheries problems arise from a failure to understand and manage
fishermen, and that the study of fishermen should be a major part of fisheries
research.  The dynamic behavior of fishing fleets can be broken into four
components: investment, movement, catching power, and discarding.  The
literature in each area is reviewed and the needed research described.  The
second part of this paper examines the causes and consequences of individual
variation in catch in a commercial purse seine fishery and a recreational hook
and line fishery.  It is shown that the catch is highly concentrated in the
recreational fishery with a small proportion of frequent anglers catching a
large portion of the fish.  Catch is more equitable distributed in the purse
seine fishery.  The consequence of individual variation includes the
observation that small annual bag limits in the sport fishery could reduce the
total catch significantly while leaving most anglers unaffected and the fact
that buy back of the most successful vessels would reduce the commercial catch
by relatively little.

Scientists and decision makers involved in fisheries management will
always be faced with uncertainties and risks, yet decisions have to be made. 
We discuss seven sources of uncertainties and illustrate how these have
affected the success or failure of past decisions in fisheries management.  We
then describe how scientists should incorporate information on uncertainties
into the advice given to decision makers by using the formal techniques of
decision analysis and statistical power analysis.  Despite the limitations of
quantitative techniques, these methods are the best way of informing decision309makers about the implications of uncertainties in fisheries management,
regardless of whether decisions are made in a risk-neutral or a risk-adverse,
precautionary context.  In addition, we discuss the findings of cognitive
psychologists on how best to communicate information about uncertainties to
managers, user groups and scientists.  Finally, in situations where weak data
create large uncertainties, institutional mechanisms that internalize
feedbacks may create incentives for a longer term viewpoint among harvesters.

Quantifying the effects of nitrogen enrichment on phytoplankton in
coastal ecosystems.  The results of three different approaches are used to
investigate relationships between nitrogen availability and phytoplankton
primary production and abundance in coastal ecosystems.  The three approaches
are controlled experiments in marine enclosures, history of changes in coastal
ecosystems, and cross system comparisons.  Most systems can be expected to
have increased primary production with increased nitrogen loadings or long
term average concentration.  Nitrogen availability alone is not a very precise
predictor of phytoplankton production or abundance.  The magnitude of the
change in phytoplankton production or abundance found for most systems is
typically in the range of 1.4 to 3 times for a doubling in nitrogen loading or
concentration.  However, there are coastal ecosystems that have not followed
the general relationships found.  Until the characteristics that sets those
systems apart from other systems can be identified, there is no guarantee that310any individual system will have the typical response.

We develop a simple extension of the theory of multispecies fisheries

bycatch problem as a standard multispecies fisheries management problem, and
we develop a multispecies model incorporating both monetary damages associated
with bycatch and variable biological relationships.  We examine the behavior
of the model with a numerical example focusing on the case of the bycatch of
sported and other dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) yellowfin
tuna fishery.

Capacity in the U.S. fish processing industry increased with the U.S.
fishing fleet following establishment of the 200 mile limit in 1977.  As U.S.
landings declined after 1983, whole imports from Canada have increased. 
Focusing on cod, haddock, and flounder, this study specifies a system of
equations to model the U.S. processing sector.  The model analyzes short run
decisions in processing and hypothesizes that both the hoarding of skilled
labor and the desire to maintain specific retail customers prompts processors
to attempt to maintain output when their principal product sources, U.S.
landings, decline.  Specifically, processors are hypothesized to bid higher
U.S. exvessel prices and to demand more whole imports from Canada. 
Underutilization of processing capacity is found to have a significant
positive effect on U.S. processors  demand for whole imports.  Whole imports
are found to have a significant negative effect on U.S. exvessel prices.

This paper examines the effects of four management strategies - effort
limitations, closed seasons, mesh size increases, and gear bans - on different
social groups in artisanal fishing communities.  In the floodplain river
fisheries examined, strong technical interactions exist between the many
different gears.  The management strategies often give rise to substantial
reallocations of yields between these gears, but, due to the balance of
benefits and losses, overall total yields are fairly insensitive to
management.  None of the scenarios examined particularly benefit the gears
most used by the poorer or most vulnerable fishermen.

Holland, Daniel S. (1999).   On Direct and Indirect Management of Fishing
Capacity.   Thalassorama, Marine Resource Economics , 14(3):263-267.
Excess capacity is a severe and costly problem that has led both to
overfishing and reduction in the net benefits derived from fishery resources. 
However, excess capacity is only a symptom of an underlying failure of the
management system.  Attempts to reduce or control capacity will likely be
offset by expansion of uncontrolled inputs.  Failure to address the causes of
excess capacity will ensure that managers will face the same problems again
sooner or later.
Holland, Daniel S. and Richard J. Brazee (1996).   Marine Reserves for
Fisheries Management.   Marine Resource Economics , 11(3):157-171.
Conventional methods of regulating commercial fisheries restrict catch
by limiting either the quantity or efficiency of fishing effort, or by putting
direct limits on catch.  These regulatory practices are neither feasible nor
desirable for many fisheries, and have failed to conserve fishery stocks in
other fisheries.  Marine reserves may be an effective alternative management
strategy for some fisheries.  Here we develop a dynamic model of marine
reserves applicable to inshore fisheries.  In contrast to previous models of
reserves, the model is fully dynamic and provides information on both
equilibrium conditions and the path to equilibrium.  A simulation model based
on red snapper data from the Gulf of Mexico is presented.  The simulation
results suggest that marine reserves can sustain or increase yields for
moderate to heavily fished fisheries but will probably not improve yields for
lightly fished fisheries.

prefer?  A rank-ordered logit model is estimated using data collected by a

questions, based on conjoint analysis, are used to determine the average
relative importance and value of the three product attributes, and to estimate
the relative attractiveness of particular products to consumers.  When used in
combination with demographic data and responses to questions on perceptions,
the analysis suggests market segmentations and potential marketing strategies
based on the heterogeneity in preferences among consumers.

Dynamics in New England Trawl Fisheries.   Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. ,
56:253-264.
Regulations and changes in market and environmental conditions that
change the profitability of one fishery or area will result in a
redistribution of fishing effort among alternative fisheries or areas.  The
magnitude of this effort displacement will depend on the relative
profitability of the alternatives for the individual fishers affected.  When
fishing areas and fishers are heterogeneous, simple aggregate effort models
such as those based on ideal free distribution theory may provide inaccurate
predictions.  We present an empirical model of individual vessel fishery and
location choice based on trip data for a group of over 400 large trawlers
fishing in New England.  The model uses lagged average revenue rates for
different alternatives and the individual vessel s past behavior to predict
choice of species group and fishing location on a trip-by-trip basis.  This
model is used to predict aggregate effort levels in different fisheries and
areas over time.

varies widely with important ramifications.  Although proper design can
improve the performance of buyback programs, we conclude buyback programs are
generally not an effective way to address the problems they are meant to
solve.

Federal fishery statistics have been collected by a number of agencies,
including the Fish Commission, Bureau of Fisheries, Fish and Wildlife Service,
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and Bureau of the Census.  The data have been
published in several series of reports.  Since funds for conducting
statistical surveys have been limited, there have been wide variations in the
frequency of the surveys in the various areas.  This has made it difficult to
determine the years in which data were available for the various sections, and
also to locate the reports in which the results of surveys were published. 
The following bibliography was prepared to make it easier to locate the
results of the various canvasses of the fisheries of the Atlantic and Gulf
states.  No attempt has been made to include those publications giving
fragmentary or summary data only, or data on only certain fisheries or states. 
Unless otherwise noted, all are publications of the National Marine Fisheries

In this paper, we describe the multidisciplinary effort of scientists at

necessary to parameterize a bioeconomic model.  The framework for developing a
quantitative bioeconomic modeling approach to explore the potential tradeoffs
of various fisheries management strategies in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem is
presented.  The model quantifies risks associates with adopting a given
harvest strategy in terms of the value of increased yield, and the maintenance
of both walleye pollock and marine mammal populations.  The simulation model
included process error in estimating recruitment and measurement error in the
stock assessment procedures.

The wealth and prosperity of the Norwegian fishing sector is due to its
corporatist arrangements giving it great political power and influence. 
Changes in this institutional structure are underway toward a pluralist system
that has weakened the fishing sector.  The consequences of this reform and its
impact on the prosperity of Norwegian fishermen is the focus of this article. 
The corporatist institutions of the Norwegian fishery sector and their
interrelationships are first described.  Second, the current reform process is
outlined and its causes are discussed.  Finally, the extent to which the
prosperity and influence of the Norwegian fishery sector can be attributed to
the corporatist arrangements and whether the present reforms mean an end to
this situation are discussed.

This paper develops a model of regulated open access resource
exploitation.  The regulatory model assumes that regulators are goal oriented,
choosing target harvest levels according to a safe stock concept.  The harvest
quotas are implemented by setting season lengths, conditioned on the industry
fishing capacity.  The industry enters until rents are dissipated, conditioned
on season length regulations.  Harvest levels, fishing capacity, season
length, and biomass are determined jointly.  Using parameter estimates from
the long regulated North Pacific Halibut fishery, predictions of these
variables from the regulated open access model are compared to predictions
that arise from the Gordon model.

A five equation econometric model was specified and estimated using

measures were found to be tenuous in simulations with benefits dissipated
through new entrants.  While all of the policies led to only modest
improvements in the price level, the variability in prices was reduced.  The
benefits from restricting imports may not be as readily apparent as has been
suggested by some advocates.

A random coefficient regression model provides an approach for
estimating the mean variable costs of specific enterprise production
activities for each output over a population of multioutput firms.  The model
specifically acknowledges that these farm level costs vary from farm to farm. 
In addition, best linear unbiased predictions can be estimated for each
activity for an individual farm.  The mean estimates are quite useful for ex
post cost analysis, thereby providing per unit cost estimates for farmers,
governmental agencies, and researchers.  The best linear unbiased predictions
can be used by individual farmers for planning yearly operations, applying for
operating loans, and analyzing marketing strategies.

Responses to Domestic Landings and Imports.""  Journal of Food

U.S. shrimp landings are divided into four geographic regional markets
and may be further subdivided into species and size characteristics. 
Seemingly unrelated regressions are used to analyze regional price responses
of variable annual landings of shrimp.  The contemporaneous correlation of
competing market supplies and demands accounted for an improvement in
forecasting reliability in each area and for species and size relationships. 
Imports were shown to affect regional markets unevenly, having a significantly
higher impact on south Atlantic shrimp prices than on Gulf of Mexico, West
Coast, or New England markets.  Real disposable personal income affected West
Coast and south Atlantic prices much more dramatically than those of Gulf321Coast markets.  The composition of the catch by size and species in each
season introduced variable responses by regional market.  Also, south Atlantic
appeared least price-sensitive to its own catch.

Variation in the species and size composition of local and regional
shrimp landings result in uncertain and sometimes volatile ex-vessel prices
paid to fishermen.  A seemingly unrelated regressions price-modeling framework
was used to forecast contemporaneous price effects of the composition of
shrimp landing in closely associated market regions.  Price responses to U.S.
regional shrimp landings and to imports were significantly related to
differentiated markets by species and location.  Regional consumer income
impacts on average ex-vessel prices for each species were also significantly
different.  Implications of shrimp price response differences in related local
markets are also discussed.

pre-1978 China had seen annual growth of 6 percent a year, post-1978 China
averaged 9 percent a year.  Although capital accumulation was important in
explaining this shift, as were the number of Chinese workers, a sharp,
sustained increase in productivity was the driving force behind the economic
boom.  This marks a departures from the traditional view of development in
which capital investment takes the lead.

This analysis utilized the production data obtained in 1982 from ponds
at the Cedar Bayou Texas A&M Mariculture Facility, east of Baytown, Texas. 
The Aquaculture Budget Simulation System developed at Texas A&M University was
applied to create budgetary information including the net return, economic
profit, break even quantities and prices, and net present values over a 10
year horizon.  This information was used to evaluate the economic feasibility
of different stocking strategies at a proposed 76 ha commercial penaeid shrimp
culture operation.  The stocking strategies consist of monoculture of Penaeus
stylirostris  at 10 and 20/m2 respectively and polyculture of P. stylirostris
with P. vannamei  at two ratios (3:1 and 1:3) with a total density of 20/m2.
The results indicated that only the polyculture of 75% P. vannamei  with
25% P. stylirostris  is economically profitable.  This stocking strategy yields
an economic profit of $54,589 for the first year of operation.  The break even
production of 1,526 kg/ha is less than the expected annual production of 1,919
kg/ha.  The break even price of $6.11/kg is less than the market price of
$8.23/kg.  The net present value is $839,424 over 10 years considering the
beginning $20,000 cash and 20% of the total investment as owner's investment. 
The payback occurred following the second year's harvest.

Stocks for Control Policies."" J. Fish. Res. Board Can.  36:845-854.
Management of harvests from mixed stocks and multipurpose fleets
requires the use of concepts not discussed in single species fishery models. 
Optimum harvest of a group of mixed stocks implies that an aggregate objective
pertaining to the multispecies catch is maximized.  This usually prohibits the
attainment of the maximum sustained yield or the maximum economic yield for
each individual stock.  Operation of a multipurpose fleet is economically
justifiable when there are significant annual or seasonal fluctuations in fish
stock abundance.  A simple linear model is developed in this paper to
demonstrate how the multipurpose fleet can be a necessary part of rational
management.

It is often asserted that measuring benefits from marketed goods is a
relatively easy task compared to the problem of measuring nonmarket values. 
However, this approach becomes more problematical when market data is
confidential and unavailable to the analyst, when externalities and unpriced
inputs are important, and when pervasive regulations and institutional norms
impose nonprice constraints on firms, consumers, and primary resource
suppliers.  The commercial fisheries exhibit all these complications.  Hence,
practical assessment of economic benefits from fisheries involves a variety of
special models, approximations, and approaches which are tailored to specific
circumstances.  Choosing from among these necessarily calls upon the
independent judgement of the analyst.  This chapter seeks to assist in those
judgements.

Consultation on the Precautionary Approach to Capture Fisheries
(TCPA), FAO Scientific Meeting, Lysekil, Sweden, May, 20 pp.
Widespread alarm over depletion of the world s marine fish stocks and
possible collapse of ocean ecosystems is one of the most predominant perceived
risks in fishery management.  The perception is that high levels of harvest
could more or less permanently diminish the economically valuable fish
resources and marine mammal populations.  Cod on the Grand Banks off
Newfoundland, red king crab in the Bering sea, and the listing of northern sea
lion populations in the western Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Island as
endangered species are three examples of the most dramatic risks.  This paper325will survey more broadly the sources of risk and related aspects of decision
making under uncertainty, dealing with stock collapse and extinction as one
end of the spectrum.  The purpose of this paper is to explore concepts and
processes common in risk assessment, extend the discussion to include economic
aspects of risk management, and relate that information to the ongoing
discussion of risk and biological reference points in the fisheries management
literature.  I assume the ultimate objective of this technical process is to
contribute information to a specific decision making system.  The approach I
take is discursive and selective.  I will mention in passing economic
perspectives on endangered species conservation, discuss some problems in
valuing economic outcomes of decisions, raise the issue of whether standard
economic optimization approaches address concerns for risk, and touch upon the
problems posed by introduction of discount rates in economic assessment of
risk management strategies.

Optimum Fleet Size in the Pacific Coast Trawl Fleet.   Marine Resource
Economics , 3(4):297-318.
Limited entry to the Pacific coast groundfish fishery poses two
principal questions: (1) How large are the potential economic returns under
limited access management and (2) will the economic benefits exceed the
program costs plus costs associated with transitory dislocations in the
fishery?  This paper reports on a partial evaluation of the first question,
based on a mixed integer programming model that computes optimum fleet size,
fishing effort configuration, and associated economic surplus.  The
multispecies fishery, economic parameters, annual harvest constraints, and
summary results are presented.  Overall a maximum economic profit of about $12
million can be generated by a trawl fleet that is about 38 percent smaller
than the baseline 1984 fleet with a 23 percent reduction in weeks fished. 
Another important conclusion is that economic profits would suffer if fishing
vessels are prevented from shifting among groundfish, pink shrimp, and joint
venture fisheries.

Government administered science in Canada and its potential for

Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus  spp.) habitat to illustrate how nonscience
influences can interfere with the dissemination of scientific information and
the conduct of science in the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
The present framework for linking fisheries science with fisheries management
has permitted, intentionally or unintentionally, a suppression of scientific
uncertainty and a failure to document comprehensively legitimate differences
in scientific opinion.  We suggest that the conservation of natural resources
is not facilitated by science integrated within a political body.  The
formation of a politically independent organization of fisheries scientists,
or some such reorganization of the link between scientific research and the
management of natural resources, merits serious and open debate.

Several characteristics of information used in resource exploration have
led to conjectures that the private market will provide a suboptimal amount of
such information.  A public information provision has been proposed as a
remedy, both for problems of underproduction and overproduction of private
information.  This paper demonstrates that, barring exceptional conditions,
public provision of information cannot be guaranteed to be a generic solution
to the private information overprovision problem.  In fact, an example is
developed to demonstrate the possibility that public information exacerbates
the private overprovision problem.

purpose of the model is to predict the effects of alternative management
policies on a fishery.  Effects are assessed in terms of total harvest;
species, size class, and seasonal distributions of the harvest; total revenue,
fishing costs, and rent in the fishery; and the distribution of revenue,
costs, and rent among different classes of fishing vessels.  A variable number
of species, size-classes, fishing areas, depths, and vessel classes can be
represented in the model at the user's discretion.  The model can be
deterministic or can have stochastic components.328Information needed and the steps involved in use of the model are
presented in two sections.  The first section provides user documentation and
indicates the model's capabilities, General program structure, available
options, data requirements, and an example problem are presented.  The second
section provides programmer documentation.  Model algorithms are presented in

The study was designed to assess the change in yield associated with
existing state laws that prevent the landing of ""small"" white shrimp during
the winter months.  This evaluation has been accomplished using a yield per
recruit analysis in which estimates of natural and fishing mortality, average
initial number of shrimp recruited to the overwintering fishery, and the
annual temperature regime with temperature and size dependent growth rate
equation (Phares, 1980) have been combined.

A simplistic discussion of the biology and the fisheries for shrimp from
the Carolinas to Texas is presented.  Primarily warm water species are
included with limited discussions on the cold water species of shrimp.  The
commercial fisheries are described, but little economic information is
included.  The section on fisheries management outlines many of the problems
facing shrimp managers and biologies, but does not indicate the root causes of
growth overfishing of shrimp or bycatch of finfish in the shrimp fishery. 
Overall, it is a good general discussion of the southeastern region shrimp
fishery from a biological point of view.

Fisheries, Paris, September 21-22.
There is a tendency to impose greater controls and more restrictions in
the face of reducing fish stocks, themselves often caused in part by
noncompliance by fishermen with current regulations.  It is not obvious that
the more complex regime will be more effective than the lesser, particularly
if as is likely it requires additional enforcement resources; such additional
complexity can itself be self defeating, both as lacking the understanding and
support of fishermen and the ability to enforce compliance.  Any regime
requires regular review as to its enforceability, the implications of some
degree on noncompliance, and the level of resources required to maintain its
effectiveness.

Paper presented at the Workshop on Enforcement Measures,

Fisheries, Paris, September 21-22.
This paper is a brief review of the surveillance and control
implications of the Law of the Sea that places on coastal states both
obligations and rights in relation to the exploitation of marine resources in
their exclusive economic zones or extended fisheries jurisdiction.  It
emphasizes the need for international agreement that still arises where a fish
stock can be exploited in more than one coastal state's zone or partly on the
high seas and points out the difficulties in achieving such agreements where
data is lacking, where there are varying conservation measures or where
standards of control differ from state to state.  It points out that the
surveillance and control system may, in certain circumstances be the
instrument for obtaining some basic data required to determine the fisheries
management regime and then examines in some detail the requirements of various
elements in the surveillance and control system - both at sea and ashore.
Jensen, A.L. (1984).  ""Logistic Surplus-Production Model with Explicit
Terms for Growth, Mortality, and Recruitment."" Transactions of the
American Fisheries Society , 113:617-626.
Conventional interpretations of the logistic equation and the logistic
surplus-production model appear to indicate that regulation of population size
occurs as a result of competition for resources among the recruited members of
a population.  Compensation for fishing mortality may involve increased growth
of adults and an increase in fecundity, but the major compensatory factor is
increased survival of early life stages.  In this study, the logistic surplus-
production model is formulated in explicit terms for growth, reproduction, and
mortality, and in this new formulation the capacity of a population to
increase and sustain a fishery is based on a stock-recruitment relation that
is a more realistic interpretation of fishery dynamics.  All parameters can be
estimated with catch and effort data.  The models were applied to the American
lobster Homarus americanus  fishery in Maine and the spiny dogfish Squalus
acanthias  fishery.  There is a considerable difference in the stock-production
curves between the two fisheries that can be interpreted in terms of a similar
difference in the spawner-recruit curves.  Because spiny dogfish produce
relatively few young, they have a lower potential for increase than American
lobsters and their rate of recruitment does not increase with exploitation as
greatly as that for lobsters.330Jensen, Carsten Lynge (1998).  ""Investment Behavior and Tax Policy.""
Marine Resource Economics , 13(3):185-196.
This paper concerns the behavioral modeling of the aggregated capital
dynamics in the Danish fishing fleet.  The emphasis is placed on testing the
impact of the after-tax user cost of capital and aggregated profit on capital
dynamics in the fishing fleet.  It is argued that the investment behavior is
driven by the incentives created by implemented tax and depreciation
legislation.  The policy implication of the study is that a tax on capital is
seen as an effective tool in controlling incentives for overcapitalization in
the fishing fleet.
Jensen, Frank and Niels Vestergaard (1999).  ""Regulation of Renewable
Resources in Federal Systems: The Case of Fishery in the EU."" 
Working Paper No. 3/99, University of Southern Denmark, Denmark,
July, 51 pp.
The EU regulation of fisheries is decided in two levels.  The level of
the total allowable catch (TAC) for the most important species is decided
every year by the Council of Ministers.  The TACs are allocated t the Member
States as quotas.  The Member states determine who is going to harvest the
quota.  There is, however, an information problem associated with this
structure.  It does not take into account how efficient fishermen in different
countries are.  In this paper we model the information problem as an adverse
selection problem and analyze an EU tax coupled t effort as an alternative to
the TAC system.  We work with the hypothesis that EU suffers from a fiscal
illusion and includes tax revenue in the objective function in order to
finance other, also inefficient, operations.  Even in the light of these
imperfections there are at least two reasons for re3commeding an EU tax. 
First, it can be used to correct part of the market failure associated with
fishery.  Second, it can be used to secure correct revelation of types in the
light of asymmetric information.

Fisheries Review , 49(2):122-137.
This paper is the first of a two part series that describes and
discusses the integration of research and extension increase to the use of
nontraditional fishes among marine recreational fishermen in the southeastern
United States.  Recreational fishermen within this region target and use or
reject fish on the basis of a variety of criteria.  Many fish caught
incidentally are discarded because of myth, rumor, or perceived negative
characteristics that mask the species' positive values.  To discover the
factors influencing the angler's evaluations concerning the desirability of
fish that ultimately affects their decision to accept or reject a particular
species, we collected judged-similarity and belief-frame comparison data in
Florida, North Carolina, and Texas, analyzing these data with the use of
multidimensional scaling, hierarchical clustering, and entailment analysis. 
We briefly describe the use of these procedures in providing for a systematic
understanding of fishermen's perceptions concerning fish and discuss the
implications of our findings for the development of educational material
directed at enhancing the image of certain underutilized species among marine
recreational fishermen.

a Fish: Some Evidence from a Steelhead Fishery.""  Marine Resource
Economics , 6(1):43-55.
Policy makers and other interested parties frequently request
information on the recreational value of a fish.  Although fishing valuation
studies date back at least 25 years, most studies focus on the average value
of a fish.  If the purpose of such estimates is to measure the value of332incremental changes in fish numbers, then use of average estimates may lead to
an incorrect policy decisions.  ?the objective of this analysis is to estimate
the marginal value of a steelhead trout in a recreational fishery on the John
Day River of Oregon.  The study uses contingent valuation procedures to elicit
willingness to pay estimates for improvements in fish numbers and success
rates.  For the anglers in this survey, the value of an additional steelhead
is $6.65 under current catch conditions.  This value is much lower than values
currently used in public debates in the Pacific Northwest, but similar to some
marginal values reported in the recent literature.  Implications of these
values relative to average values are discussed.

10(4):327-340.
Taxing pure rents is usually considered the least distortionary method
for raising revenues.  In the literature on fishery economics, the term  rent 
is regularly employed, suggesting that pure rents exist in that sector. 
Indeed, with the recent development of individual transferable quotas, the
resulting market value of quota has been treated as reflecting pure resource
rents.  In this paper, the view that the market value of quota represents a
pure rent that can be readily extracted in a nondistortionary manner by the
taxing authority is challenged because that argument ignores both economic
incentives and political realities.

Compared to the mature and relatively orderly fisheries of the U.S., the
Russian Far East (FRE) industry is in a period of rapid and dramatic change. 
The new Russian entrepreneurs are breaking into markets previously controlled
by Americans, and this is affecting prices paid for some products, such as
king crab and halibut.  On the other hand, change has not come as quickly as
some observers had predicted, and the effects of Russian salmon on world
markets, for example, has so far been less than many had expected.  The huge
and gradually more affluent domestic market is absorbing much of the FRE s
fisheries output.  Russian industrialists will continue to pour cash into the
fisheries as long as the fisheries continue to produce attractive returns, and
at present it seems that will be the case for some time to come.

Events in international markets can have enormous consequences in
domestic markets and may importantly affect the relationship between fish
landings and marginal net economic value.  Attempts to implement the equi-
marginal rule may require reallocation in response to those events.  Failure
to recognize interdependencies between international trade policy and resource
management may lead to unexpected results.  Collaboration between fishery
managers and trade policymakers may reduce this problem.  Whether or not the
equi-marginal principle, as a norm, is adopted by fishery managers who must
consider political and other ""non-economic"" criteria, it may offer guidance
for potentially useful research.  For fishery managers, this suggests a better
understanding of the markets into which the resources they manage move.

Because of the externalities that exist within fisheries and between
fisheries and other sectors of the economy, fishery management may be an
important component of a fishery development strategy.  Recognizing that there
may be gains from internalizing externalities within the fishery may
contribute significantly to meeting the goals of fishery development.  Also
recognizing the interdependencies with other sectors of the economy may
prevent unanticipated consequences from the adoption of fishery development
strategies.  A development policy that looks at the potential contribution of
the fishery to the entire economy and considers development from that
perspective, rather than from a solely fishery point of view, should minimize
frustration and increase the chances of achieving development goals.

This paper addresses uncertain biomass shifts in renewable resources.  A
biomass shift occurs when a dominant renewable resource stock collapses and
its ecosystem niche is filled by a replacement species which increases in
abundance after the initial collapse.  This paper develops a bioeconomic model
for a fishery subject to random biomass shift.  Optimal policy for three
causes of biomass shift - environmental perturbation, overfishing, and a
combination of these two factors - is derived and compared to optimal policy
when the risk of biomass shrift is not present.  For each cause of biomass
shift, the model allows for a valued and non-valued replacement species.334Jones, Albert C. and James R. Zweifel (1982).  ""Shrimp Fleet Mobility in

The value of commercial shrimp landings for 1971 in the state of Texas

Lavaca-Galveston, and Beaumont-Port Arthur in 1971 this value was $37.6,
$23.6, and $2.7 million, respectively.  These commercial shrimp landings have
a significant impact on the economy of Texas and on the economies of the three
coastal regions.  The estimated direct, indirect and induced impact of 1971
commercial shrimp landings on the Texas economy was $197.2 million in output;
$56.8 million in personal incomes; and 6,083 persons employed.  Within the
Brownsville-Aransas region, the $37.6 million landings by the commercial
shrimp industry stimulated total economic output of $92.5 million.  The $23.6
million landings by the commercial shrimp industry within the Port Lavaca-335Galveston region stimulated total economic output of $55.9 million.  Total
economic output of $8.5 million was stimulated by the $2.7 million landings by

This study uses data from a 45 vessel sample of South Carolina's double
rig resident shrimp trawlers to analyze resource productivity and
profitability in the fishery from 1971 to 1975.  Smaller vessels (<55 feet)
were more profitable, and averaged 14 years older than the larger (>55 feet)
vessels and had lower operating costs.  Placing vessels of both size classes
on the same risk and financing cost basis would result in slightly higher
percentage returns, i.e. lower losses, to investment in the larger trawlers
than to investment in the smaller trawlers.  The opportunity cost analysis
indicated that shrimping labor is earning less than its opportunity income, as
is new capital investment, but that management (the vessel captains) is
earning above what it would in its best alternative.  The larger vessels
typically possessed about 1.4 times the fishing power of the typical smaller
vessels; engine horsepower was the most significant predictor of fishing
power.  However, multiplication of the vessel fishing power index by the
transformed fuel consumption variable showed that the average larger vessel
exerted only 15 percent more effort in the fishery than did the typical
smaller vessel.

This analysis compared the use of an intensive nursery raceway system
with direct stocking of post-larval shrimp (PLS) into growout ponds.  The
intensive raceway system allows two crops to be produced in Texas where only
one crop is feasible with direct stocking.  Both investment and operational
costs are analyzed for three types of greenhouses and three types of raceways
where the types vary in cost and lengths of life.  Three growout pond stocking
densities and two farm sizes were evaluated for each combination of greenhouse
and raceway type.  Investment costs ranged from $142,000, for the small farm
using the least expensive greenhouse and raceway and utilizing the lowest
stocking density, to about $2.3 million, for the large farm using the most
expensive greenhouse and raceway, respectively, per 1,000 one gram juveniles
produced.  Under technology available at the time of this analysis, direct
stocking growout ponds with PLS and producing one crop per year is more
profitable than stocking one gram juveniles and producing two crops per year
on the Texas coast.

Shrimp have supported the most valuable fishery in the United States for
many years.  Although the fishery for the cold water species Crangon  and
Pandalus  has increased in recent years in the New England and Alaska areas,
the mainstay is still the penaeid shrimp of the southeastern United States. 
Three species make up the bulk of the catch, Penaeus  aztecus , P. duorarum , and
P. setiferus .  The center of this fishery is in the Gulf of Mexico and along
the southeastern seaboard of the United States.  The average annual catch of
penaeids over the past 25 years has been close to 100,000 tons in those areas. 
Production in recent years from other countries in the CICAR area, including
Brazil, has been 70,000 tons; worldwide the total annual catch is close to
700,000 tons.  Minor periodic annual variations in production have occurred,
attributed generally to adverse environmental or economic factors.  Although
the shrimp bycatch problem was long known in the United states, it was not
until late 1972 that a project was implemented to study the situation.  Basic337information was needed for management purposes, for possible use of bycatch
and for application to design of gear that would reduce the catch of fish
(savings gear), e.g., electric or separator trawls.  In view of the relevance
of the bycatch problem to other nations in the CICAR area, a description of
the ongoing work and preliminary results are presented.

measures the sum of rents to producers selling in all higher markets plus

Fisheries Service, St. Petersburg, Florida.
As part of a management strategy to rebuild the depleted stocks of king338and Spanish mackerel, the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management
councils developed ceilings on catches and Allocated portions to the
recreational and commercial harvesters.  Recreational anglers must comply with
bag limits and a quota while the commercial anglers comply with a quota. 
Federal fisheries permits identify and allow the owner or operator to possess
mackerels in excess of the bag limits.  To qualify for a permit, an owner or
operator of the fishing vessel must derive at least 10 percent of their earned
income from commercial fishing.  Earned income means wages and salaries of
crew on a commercial fishing vessel, gross income from the sale of fish for a
commercial fishing business, or income from services involving the sale of
fish.  Since the permit and earned income requirements became regulations in

Kaczynski, Wlodzimierz (1979). ""Responses and Adjustments of Foreign
Fleets to Controls Imposed by Coastal Nations."" J. Fish. Res.
Board Can. , 36:800-810.
Foreign distant water fishing fleets expanded quickly during the last 15
years and in some ocean areas accounted for a larger portion of the coastal
fishery resources harvest than neighboring coastal nations.  Extension of
national jurisdiction sharply decreased these activities.  Catch and fishing
effort limitations imposed by coastal states were of particular concern for
foreign fleets.  To attenuate adverse effects of these restrictions, distant
water fishing operators are considering three basic and mutually complementing
solutions: better utilization of their own coastal resources until now
frequently neglected, shifting a part of their fleets to open ocean fishing
operations, and continuing highly restricted and reorganized fisheries in
coastal zones of other nations.  Fishing activities within the 200 mile
economic zone involve utilization of surplus quotas allocated by coastal
states, quicker development of joint venture operations with coastal partners,
increased purchases of fresh fish from local fishermen, and transfer of
technology and know how mainly to the developing coastal countries.  Supplies
of goods and services are also accepted by foreign fleets in exchange for
access rights to the marine living resources of the coastal nations.
However, all these adjustments of foreign fleets are considered an
intermediate stage of the long run trend in which the coastal state will be
able to develop the resources without substantial participation of foreign
fishermen.  This trend is analyzed in the North Pacific distant water
fisheries development during recent years.

Terrestrial Pollution of Marine Ecosystems.""  Marine Resource
Economics , 4:193-209.339This paper looks at the problem of modeling the welfare consequences of
the effects of environmental changes on the bioeconomic equilibrium of
fisheries.  The equilibrium catch equation is suggested as the most
appropriate mechanism for modeling these effects.  Several different models
are presented, based on the availability of data.  It is shown that a model in
which the equilibrium catch function is estimated directly as a function of
environmental quality will be superior to a model that takes the stock effects
from an independent ecosystem model.  Models are also suggested for those
cases in which only proxies for stock levels are available, and for those
cases in which no stock data are available.  An earlier draft report is also
included in the file.

This study employs theoretical and empirical concepts from ecology and

reductions in the level of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in Chesapeake
Bay.  These reductions in SAV are believed to be a consequence of the runoff
of agricultural chemicals, discharges from waste treatment plants and soil

in Chesapeake Bay fisheries in a fashion that is consistent with the economic
theory of benefit measurement.

This paper develops behavioral models for examining the reactions of
marine resource users to reduced resource quality associated with brown algal
blooms.  Models of recreational and commercial fishing are developed, as well
as other recreational uses that emphasize the concept that the presence of
brown tides at certain sites will cause the substitution of other sites and
other species.  These substitutions will have additional implications for
economic welfare.  The conceptual models are applied to the bay scallop
fishery where annual economic losses are of the order of two million dollars.

Kaitala, Veijo and Gordon R. Munro (1993).  ""The Management of High Seas
Fisheries.""  Marine Resource Economics , 8(4): 313-329.
A new and acute management problem, now the focus of a major U.N.
conference, has arisen in recent years in international fisheries.  The
problem concerns the management of transboundary fishery resources, in the
form of resources to be found in both the coastal state EEZ and the adjacent
high seas.  The resources are commonly referred to as ""straddling"" stocks. 
This article provides a preliminary exploration of the management issue.  It340reviews the historical and legal background and asks how far the now well
developed economic analysis of the management of transboundary fishery
resources in the form of resources ""shared"" by two or more coastal states will
take us in examining this second and more recent transboundary fishery
management problem.  The answer is only a very limited distance.  The article
concludes by pointing to questions arising from this resource management issue
demanding further research.

This study examines the welfare effects of alternative price policies
for exhaustible resource markets.  Dynamically optimal plans for resource
producers are derived under laissez faire, temporary price controls, and
import tariffs.  The associated paths of consumer, producer, and aggregate
social surplus are compared to produce rankings of the policies.  In the
presence of monopsonistic power on the part of a net importing nation, an
import levy can be optimal.  In general, price controls are welfare-inferior
to laissez faire, unless the social cost of imports exceeds the private cost
by an amount that rises rapidly over time.

The empirical literature on discrete response contingent valuation has
found that seemingly innocuous changes in the statistical models estimated
result in significantly different point estimates of willingness to pay.  This
paper hypothesizes and tests several potential explanations for these results. 
First, it investigates and compares the biases inherent in single-bounded and
double-bounded maximum likelihood estimation procedures and examines how they
react to various bid designs and sample sizes.  Then, it examines the presence
and identification of  outliers  in binary choice data and how these outliers
influence estimation.  Finally, it presents an alternative approach to
addressing the issue of outliers which explicitly acknowledges the possibility
of upwardly biased response probabilities.

In this paper we describe a model using a household production framework
to link measures of nonpoint source pollution to fishing quality and a random
utility model to describe how that quality influences sport fishing parties 
decisions in North Carolina.  The results provide clear support for using a
model that evaluates the effects of pollution on the activities and decisions
associated with the fishing activity once a trip is taken.  Site selection
decisions are then conditioned on the anticipated quality of fishing sites. 
The framework also has the advantage of linking the spatial, technical, and
economic information required to evaluate the management plans required for
estuaries under the National Estuarine Program.

used to develop a measure for the value of a controlled environment and for
the value of information about the stochastic environment.

Entry Permits in Alaska.""  Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. , 41:1160-
1166.
Under Alaska's entry limitation program, transferable permits convey
fishing rights.  Information from permit markets is used to study several key
issues regarding the behavior of fishermen and the effects of fishery
management policy.  I conclude that (1) expectations of future fishing incomes
are the primary determinants of permit prices, (2) Alaska Department of Fish
and Game forecasts of fish recruitment are capitalized in permit values, (3) a
state program that provides low interest loan money to some purchasers of
permits has coincided with a significant increase in permit prices, (4) the
""average memory"" of fishermen in projecting future incomes is about 2.5 years,
and (5) it is possible to infer the rate at which the markets discount future
fishing income flows.
Karpoff, J.M. (1985).  ""Time, Capital Intensity, and the Cost of Fishing
Effort.""  Western Journal of Agricultural Economics , 10(2):254-342258.
If the short run marginal costs of setting and retrieving a net one more
time, fishing an extra day, or setting an extra pot or trap are constant, then
the prediction by Anderson (1976) that entry limitations preserve a portion of
the fishery's value could be invalid.  A vessel's optimum capital intensity
depends on the length of the fishing season.  The shorter the fishing season,
the less time each fisherman has to utilize his capital to harvest fish, and
the less total fishing effort is applied to the fishery.  Since higher levels
of catching power are now utilized over a shorter fishing season, they lose
some of their cost advantages, and less capital intensive vessels become more
cost effective.  Stricter time constraints penalize more capital intensive
vessels relatively heavily and create wealth transfers among classes of
fishermen.
The logical extension of this line of reasoning would be that less
capital intensive vessels tend to dominate fisheries that have severely
limited fishing seasons.  However, in practice it would appear that more
capital intensive vessels appear in fisheries that are the most time
restricted, e.g. the herring fisheries in the Pacific northwest.  Perhaps this
result occurs because of the author's use of time in a static analysis or
because of the failure to consider the common property externality explicitly
in his analysis.
Karpoff, Jonathan M. (1987).  ""Suboptimal Controls in Common Resource
Management: The Case of the Fishery.""  Journal of Political
Economy , 95(11):179-194.
The discrepancy between elaborate proposals to solve the common pool
fishery problem and actual fishery regulations is examined.  The self-interest
hypothesis of regulation and fisherman heterogeneity can explain tow
historically popular types of fishery regulations, season closures and capital
constraints.  These have differential impacts on fishermen and typically
redistribute the fishery's harvest from more efficient toward less efficient
producers.  To the extent that fishermen indigenous to a regulatory body's
jurisdiction also tend to be relatively inefficient, it is predicted that
these regulations will withstand the theory and data that demonstrate their
suboptimality.
Karpoff, J.M. (1989).  ""Characteristics of Limited Entry Fisheries and
the Option Component of Entry Licenses.""  Land Economics , 65(4),
pp. 386-393.
The paper examines conditions under which fishermen are likely to
support entry restrictions.  Entry restrictions generate positive (quasi-)
rents precisely because they exclude or have the potential to exclude some
fishermen.  The probability of exclusion is positive for most fishermen, so
advocacy of entry restrictions is not riskless.  For many fishermen the risk
of exclusion outweighs the expected gain from restricted competition.  When
fishermen do advocate entry restrictions, they do so when the expected net
gain is positive.

The current widespread use of taxpayer-funded public sector institutions
to deliver fisheries management services limits the likelihood of successfully
implementing any solution.  Our opinion is that full cost-recovery of
fisheries management services, by motivating fishers to demand cost effective
management and stronger property rights, represents a powerful stimulus to the
evolution of more effective institutional and operational arrangements.  Such
arrangements are likely to feature an increasing provision of fisheries
management services by the private sector.
Kazmierczak, Richard F., Jr. and Rex H. Caffey (1995).   Management Ability
and the Economics of Recirculating Aquaculture Production Systems.  
Marine Resource Economics , 10(2):187-209.
A bioeconomic model of fish growth in recirculating aquaculture systems
was constructed by developing a bioenergetic model comprised of metabolic
submodels for growth, ammonia production, and oxygen consumption.  Metabolite
accumulations are determined by exogenous control variables for filtration and
aeration and used to indirectly represent management ability.  Numerical
solutions to model parameters were obtained using a two point boundary
shooting algorithm within a dynamic profit maximization framework.  Optimal
trajectory, isoquant, and bioeconomic optimization analyses describe specific
tradeoff relationships existing between nutrition, density, and technology. 
Results demonstrate the economic importance of these relationships changes
over time in response to fish weight, and not always in ways suggested by the
physical importance of individual factors.  Specifically, economically viable
tradeoffs between dietary protein and stocking density occur over relatively
narrow regions to management ability.  Without highly experienced and capable
management, the biological realities of recirculation systems may preclude
profitable system operation.

 Noncompetitive Pricing and Exchange Rate Pass-Through in Mauritanian
Octopus Export Markets.   Journal of Agribusiness , 15(1):85-102.
Octopus exports are an important source of foreign exchange earnings for
Mauritania.  The export market has historically been dominated by coordinated
Japanese buyers, a situation that led Mauritania to create the Societe
Mauritanienne de Commercialisation de Poisson (SMCP) to negotiate with buyers
and manage all octopus exports. Issues concerning competitiveness, price
discrimination, and exchange rate pass-through in the Mauritanian octopus
export market were empirically examined in this study using a seemingly
unrelated regression model corrected for contemporaneous and serial
correlation.  Results indicate some degree of price discrimination across
destination markets, market share enhancement through local currency price
stabilization, and increases in marginal costs of production following
nationalization of the Mauritanian trawler fleet.  Thus, while creation of the
SMCP did not result in the development of complete countervailing market
power, Mauritania has managed to enhance the position of its octopus exports
in the lucrative Japanese market.344KCA Research, Inc. (1992).  ""Management Summary, Socio-Economic Survey

A travel cost demand model is derived from a utility function that
postulates that individuals choose the optimal total number of site recreation
days given by the product of the number of length of their recreation trips. 
By relaxing the assumption that on-site time is constant across
recreationists, the applicability of the travel cost method is extended.  The
model is estimated using a maximum likelihood procedure appropriate for the
truncated sample data that is characteristic of most user specific recreation
data.  Failure to do so would result in overestimating the value of Great
Lakes fishing by 3.5 times.

Limited entry has been instituted in a variety of fisheries in different
countries.  The volume of literature evaluating its use and developing ways to
make it more effective as a fisheries management tool is large and growing. 
It has not worked well, primarily because rights have created a focus on
harvest, not on husbandry.  The efficacy of sole ownership rights in
management of resources of the forest and field are clear.  A case for
research and development of sole ownership as a rights system for fishery
resources is made in this article.
Keen, Elmer A. (1991).  ""Ownership and Productivity of Marine Fishery
Resources?"" Fisheries , 16(4):18-22.346The incentives of the commons ceased to suffice as a management
framework for marine fishery resources during the 1960's.  The laws of demand
and supply went awry.  Demand rose; supply of the more valuable species
declined as fishing effort increased.  Measures taken to solve the resulting
overfishing problem have failed to remove the root cause, the incentives of
harvester rights inherent in a commons.  The resulting management system
creates ill will and friction that severely impedes management of the
resources.  The efficacy of a management framework based on ownership of the
ocean pastures is compared to one based on rights to harvest.  The conclusion
is reached that a full owner framework provides a well tested basis for
management of marine fishery resources that can result in a large increase in
resource benefits.
Keiser, Richard K., Jr. (1976).  ""Species Composition, Magnitude and
Utilization of the Incidental Catch of the South Carolina Shrimp
Fishery.""  South Carolina Marine Resource Center, Technical Report
Number 16, September, 1976.
The quantity of fish caught incidental to shrimping activities in South
Carolina was estimated by determining fish/whole shrimp ratios from commercial
catches.  The overall median fish/shrimp weight ratio was 1.94:1; however, the
median ratio varied seasonally being smaller from September to December
(1.24:1) than from May to August (3.58:1).  The confidence interval for this
estimate was defined by the 25th and 75th percentiles.  An estimated fish catch
of between 3,358,000 and 15,197,000 kgs was derived from expansion of detailed
ratio estimates derived from this study.  Sciaenids were the predominant
family during the study except for the months of January and April when
clupeids and gadids, respectively, comprised the greatest percentage of the
catch.  In general, fish caught incidental to shrimping were small; mean total
lengths of 25 species ranged from 6.90 to 18.58 cm.  At the present time, only
a fraction of the total incidental catch is landed; the majority is discarded
at sea.  This apparently reflects a lack of demand for most species captured. 
It is estimated that 74% of the flounder catch is landed and sold as food fish
compared to less than 2% of the sciaenids and scombrids.

Imports represent a large and growing component of the total U.S. shrimp
supply.  Industry, concerned with their trend, has in the past attempted to
control imports.  Before national policy can be made, policy makers must have
an understanding of the role of imports in the U.S. market.  The purpose of
this study was to provide an understanding of the U.S. shrimp industry, the
underlying factors responsible for the recent rise in imports, the role of347imports in establishing prices, and the effects of alternate policy options. 
Results indicate that tariffs, at least within realistic ranges, would be only
marginally successful in limiting imports and increasing domestic prices. 
Quotas would be more successful than tariffs at achieving the aforementioned
objectives.

An economic analysis of the U.S. based surface long-line fishery
operating in the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Region is
provided.  The analysis is conducted at the trip level since this is likely to
be the level at which short run decisions are most relevant to the individual
firm whose other components of effort are fixed during this period of time. 
This aggregate analysis will help explain the response in aggregate catch to
changes in the short run inputs under the control of the individual fishing
firm at the trip level and can be used to help analyze the potential in
aggregate trip catch that might be forthcoming as a result of regulations that
limit activities at the trip level but are not specific to individual species. 
Non-separability in outputs and jointness in inputs suggests that attempts to
manage any particular species in this multi-product sector must consider
possible spillover effects into the other fisheries.

National Marine Fisheries Service, NA47FD0290, Coastal Fisheries
Institute, Louisiana State University, May, 107 pp.
This study provided a detailed analysis of the Southeast Reef Fish
processing industry for 1995 (which includes almost all processors of species
under jurisdiction of the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Management
Councils) to help identify potential impacts related to management measures
imposed on the harvesting sector.  The primary conclusion reached from this
research effort is that the extreme diversity of the southeast U.S. processing
industry (in terms of number of species utilized etc.) and the large supply of
domestic and imported raw material relative to current usage among processors
will tend to insulate processors somewhat from restrictions imposed on the
harvesting sector that would limit the overall supply of domestic product.

Shrimp Fishery: An Economic Perspective with Emphasis on the 1987
Inshore Fleet.""  Draft Report, Coastal Fisheries Institute, Center

Louisiana.
Louisiana leads the nation in the poundage of shrimp produced.  Its
fleet, numbering upwards of 20 thousand in total, is exceedingly diverse which
complicates any attempt at developing an ""optimal"" management strategy.  For
example, the smaller boats in the fleet tend to fish in and around the
shoreline of the state and target relatively small shrimp as they migrate
offshore.  The larger boats are more offshore based and tend to target a
larger shrimp which has a higher per pound price.  Actions taken by the
smaller inshore and near-shore boats impact the performance of the offshore
fleet through a reduction in shrimp availability in offshore waters.  This
paper provides a general economic evaluation of the Louisiana shrimp fishery;
particularly the inshore component.  It was accomplished though the use of
secondary and primary data.  The secondary data consisted of National Marine349Fisheries Service data on shrimp landings and related effort data and also the
Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries data on commercial shrimp
license sales.  The primary data were obtained through a 1987 survey of the
Louisiana shrimp fleet.  Such an evaluation is necessary before sound policy
and management can be implemented.

Shrimp Imports and Dockside Prices with Policy Implications."" 
Draft Report, Center for Weltand Resources, Louisiana State
University, Baton Rouge, La.
U.S. imports of shrimp have been increasing at record levels during the
1980's.  These increased imports, and their potential impact on the domestic
dockside price structure, have been of significant concern to the U.S. shrimp
harvesting sector and have recently led to a Federal investigation conducted
under Section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 which evaluated conditions of
competition affecting the Gulf and south Atlantic shrimp fishery.  This paper
presents a model, developed within an appropriate statistical and economic
framework, that explains the growth in U.S. imports of shrimp and their impact
on dockside shrimp prices.  Significant factors which were found to determine
annual levels of shrimp imports include: (1) the price of imports, (2)
southeastern shrimp landings, (3) beginning shrimp inventories, (4) U.S. real
disposable income, (5) exchange rates, (6) the Japanese import price of
shrimp, (7) world production of shrimp, and (8) foreign real income. 
Increased imports were found to have a significant negative impact on
southeast shrimp dockside prices.

The southeast U.S. shrimp fishery has been the focus of considerable
attention in recent years, the result of both its size and impacts on other
fisheries.  Seasonal and/or area closures of the shrimp fishery have been
proposed in the gulf region as one means of protecting juvenile fish as well
as increasing the shrimp yield.  The impacts of seasonal/area closures on the

the southeast U.S. shrimp industry, are largely unknown to regulatory agencies
responsible for imposing any such restrictions.  This paper provides an

Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Shrimp is one of the world s largest fisheries when measured in terms of
the value of output.  With the increased success of farming activities
throughout the world, during the 1980's, world shrimp production, i.e.,
combined wild and farm raised harvests, expanded substantially.  Trade in this
important seafood commodity simultaneously expanded and became more complex in
nature.  First, shrimp production by primary producing areas of the world
(i.e., Central America, South America, and Asia) are examined in this paper351during the 1980-93 period and changes therein are related to farming
activities.  Then, exports of shrimp products by region of the world are
analyzed with respect to the two primary import markets, the United States and
Japan.  Changes in volume of trade, export prices and product composition are
evaluated and related to production trends.

Demand for Oyster Relaying Activities in Louisiana: 1976-95.  Draft
Report, Coastal Fisheries Institute, Wetland Resources Building,
Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, December, 28 pp.
Louisiana leads the nation in terms of annual production of oyster
meats.  Production is derived from both leased water-bottoms and the public
seed grounds.  A sizeable amount of the water-bottoms under lease is under
either conditional or restricted status.  To make the best economic use of
leases under these two statuses, lease holders will, at times, relay oysters
from leases in conditional or restricted areas to leases in approved areas. 
This paper examines relaying activities in Louisiana during the 1976-95
period.  Specifically, an econometric model was developed and estimated to
examine the demand for relaying activities in the state.  Results suggest that
demand depends significantly on economic as well as environmental factors.

Processing is an often overlooked component of the U.S. seafood
industry.  This paper presents an economic analysis of the southeast U.S. blue
crab processing industry, and changes therein, during the 1973-90 period.  The
analysis was conducted based on unpublished NMFS records on processing
activities among individual blue crab processing firms in the Southeast.  The
analysis found that while blue crab processing activities, as measured in
pounds processed, increased significantly during 1973-90, the deflated value
of these activities increased only marginally due to a sharp decline in the
deflated price of the processed product.

The purpose of this paper is to examine structural changes in the
southeast shrimp processing industry.  The analysis, based on NMFS end-of-the-
year surveys of seafood processing establishments, covers the 1973-90 period. 
Issues considered in the analysis included (1) changes in numbers of firms and
shrimp products produced, (2) changes in productivity measured in terms of
firm output and output per worker, and (3) changes in industry concentration
and specialization.  In general, results indicate a decline in the absolute
number of southeast shrimp processors but a large increase in productivity per
firm, measured on a poundage basis.  Because of a decline in the per pound
price of the processed products, however, deflated shrimp processing revenues
per firm have remained essentially unchanged since the late 1970's.

A simultaneous model including the U.S. and Japan shrimp import markets

shrimp farming activities in the 1980's on U.S. imports and domestic warm
water dockside shrimp prices.  Results of the modeling effort suggest that
current, i.e., 1988-1989, U.S. shrimp import levels would be in the
neighborhood of 200 million pounds below observed levels in the absence of
farm raised shrimp production on the world market and that the import price
would be about 80% higher.  The domestic dockside warm water shrimp price
would also be significantly higher.  Any rise in domestic warm water shrimp
prices, brought about by a reduction in imports of the farm based product, was
shown to encourage additional effort in the domestic shrimp fleet and a
concurrent decline in industry profit.

Substantial improvement is returns for the North Carolina bay scallop
fishery by delaying the opening of the season beyond its traditional date.  A
general bioeconomic harvesting model was developed for use in determining the
optimal season opening/closing schedule for a seasonal fishery with the
control specified as an on/off switch.  One hundred and twenty separate
scenarios were created by setting five exogenous variables to reasonable
alternative values.  The optimal season is contrasted with the unregulated
case for each scenario.  The optimal opening was typically two to three weeks
later than the model of past practices.

We identify both the importance of fishing capacity to modern fisheries

concepts of capacity in the fisheries literature is used to elucidate the
properties that the missing definition should have.  Fishing capacity is then
defined in terms of the fishing mortality that a boat or a fleet could exert
under specified conditions.  Capacity thus defined is contrasted with fishing
effort, fishing power, and capital investment in the fishery.  The remaining
problems with this definition of capacity are examined and it is suggested
that these are inevitable consequences of attempting to measure fishing
capacity, regardless of the definition chosen.

A fishery is considered in which the young are harvested by one nation
and the adults by another.  The harvests are sold on separate markets. 
Finding the optimal strategies of the two nations is treated as a problem in
dynamic noncooperative game theory.  While in most other models players make355decisions simultaneously at each stage, in this model each player makes his
decision separately in time, knowing the action of the previous player.  The
model is applied to the southern bluefin tuna fishery that is jointly
exploited by Australia and Japan.  The results of noncooperative and
cooperative strategies are compared.

dependent quotas.  Results from applying the model to the southern bluefin
tuna fishery indicate that restricting or eliminating the Australian catch of

Many values can be set for MSY or TAC of a fishery resource, among them
the greatest occurs only rarely.  With poor comprehension of the statistical
character of MSY, few attempts to manage fisheries with reference to it have
been successful.  That outcome has resulted partly from inadequacies of the
general paradigm of stock assessment, but more from failure to appreciate the
significance of the economic and social terms of the exploitation equation.  A
plea is made for a system of fishery resources law which, of local, national,
and international effect, would restrain the economic drives and social
impulses that so far have frustrated the efforts of fishery administrators,
denied industrial stability, and threatened resource survival.

The expected results of wetland restoration and creation projects, as
characterized in the proposed analytical framework, can be based on the
results of ongoing scientific and technical research.  However, there has been
very little directed research to determine the availability and cost of the
resources required to carry out specific restoration tasks or reach certain
restoration targets.  Since the proposed framework, and the evaluation of
wetland restoration and creation alternatives in general, require information
about both costs and performance, some new research priorities are required to
parallel ongoing scientific and technical research.  These involve defining
the individual tasks that constitute creation and restoration projects,
determining the different ways of completing them, and estimating costs.  Such
research, when combined with the results of scientific and technical research,
will contribute significantly to our understanding of both near term and long

Damages: Law and Economics , John Wiley and Sons, New York.
The analytical framework developed in this chapter is designed to show
how much it costs to restore ecological functions; it is not intended to show
how much should be spent on restoration.  Nonetheless, the framework can be
used to screen out clearly wasteful restoration efforts and to identify some
important economic trade offs involving changes in restoration costs and
resulting changes in lost ecosystem functions and values.  It will become
apparent that when the expected speed and level of ecosystem recovery,
measured using indicators of structural or functional health, is used to
measure the relative success of a restoration effort, the framework provides a
reasonable basis for making decisions about appropriate, if not optimal,
levels of restoration.

Applied Ecological Economics.""  Paper presented at the Second
Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics

Draft report, Maryland International Institute for Ecological
Economics, University of Maryland, Center for Environmental and
Estuarine Studies, Solomons, Maryland.
The important challenges facing ecological economics are becoming less
ideological and more practical.  Most world leaders are beginning to
understand that investing in natural capital is a prerequisite for
sustainability.  What they need now is more information about ecological
economic linkages so they can reconcile the long term goal of sustainability
with near term economic needs.359In some circumstances the conventional method of evaluating production
and investment decisions-benefit cost analysis (BCA)-can be expanded to
include indirect measures of costs and benefits that result from ecological
linkages; this may result in more sustainable near term resource management
decisions.  In other cases the use of benefit cost analysis is impractical,
and sustainable near term production and investment decisions need to be
justified on the basis of safe minimum standards.
In this paper, an expanded benefit cost framework is developed using six
discrete pathways of potential project impacts.  Two originate with
withdrawals from and emissions to nature and generate measures of costs and
benefits that are based on an expanded view of facts about ecological economic
linkages.  Two other pathways develop market based and nonmarket estimates of
costs and benefits associated with ecological economic linkages and are
responsible for assigning values.  The last two pathways deal with
distributional impacts and other socioeconomic considerations that reflect
collective decisions about equity and balance.
Where there is too much uncertainty about facts, or too much
disagreement about values, equity, or balance, decision making on the basis of
benefit cost analysis may be impractical.  In such cases the level of
protection granted to a particular natural resource and the amount of public
intervention to control market forces that could otherwise result in further
degradation of that resource can be based on safe minimum standards.  A
framework is developed here that uses measures of ecological importance and
reversibility to assign safe minimum standards and evaluate decisions about
the level os types of natural resources.

Preferences for Fish and Seafood: An Evoked Set Analysis."" 
Presented at the International Conference on Fisheries Economics,
Os, Norway, May 26-28.
This study uses the concept of an ""evoked set"" to test hypotheses about
the determinants of consumer preferences for seafood, especially catfish. 360Conceptually, the evoked set includes those specific products (e.g., catfish,
shrimp, or flounder) that are evoked by the consumer in the context of a
decision to purchase from the general category (fish and seafood).  In this
study the evoked set is operationally defined as consisting of those seafood
items named in answering the question: What are your three favorite types of
fish and seafood?
Data from a national survey are used to estimate a four equation
recursive model of preference formation and consumption behavior.  Results
indicate consumer preferences for the top seven fish types (shrimp, lobster,
catfish, cod, flounder, scallops, and salmon) are mainly a function of the
consumer's geographical location and ethnicity.  Consumer beliefs about fish
product attributes (e.g., quality, flavor, nutrition) and product category use
experience (frequency of fish consumption) in general are not significant
preference determinants, although important exceptions are noted.  The
composition of the evoked set may have different behavioral implications
depending on whether fish consumption occurs in the home or in a restaurant
setting.

Generic advertising is used by fish producers to accelerate demand
growth or to alleviate temporary surpluses.  Whether this cooperative
promotional venture is profitable depends on a number of factors including
industry supply response.  A rent dissipation model applied to the U.S.
catfish industry suggests the quasi-rents generated by increased advertising
are more than sufficient to cover incremental costs over any reasonable time
horizon.

""Processor Demand and Price-Markup Functions for Catfish: A
Disaggregated Analysis with Implications for the Off-Flavor
Problem.""  Southern Journal of Agricultural Economics ,
80(December):81-91.
Off-flavor in catfish restricts farm marketing 10 to 45% depending on
the season.  The economic impact on society of this imposed supply restriction
depends, in part, on the elasticity of demand for catfish.  Econometric
estimates based on disaggregated processing plant data indicate an elastic
demand at the processor level but an inelastic demand at the farm level. 
Short run social welfare gains from the elimination of off-flavor are
estimated to equal 12.0% of farm revenues ($10.0 million in 1983).  The361inelastic demand for catfish at the farm level, however, means that most of
the societal gains will accrue to individuals beyond the farm gate.  Thus, an
economic justification exists for public sector funding of off-flavor
research.

Achieving social and economic efficiency in a fishery requires that
production be technically efficient.  Yet, technical efficiency (TE) is rarely
examined for a fishery.  By the use of detailed trip-level data and
information about resource conditions obtained from routine sampling, a
stochastic frontier production model relating landings to days at sea, crew
size, and resource conditions is specified and estimated for 10 Mid-Atlantic
sea scallop dredge vessels.  TE is shown to depend partly on the mix of
controllable inputs such as days at sea and crew size but possibly more on
uncontrollable factors such as resource conditions and biological
characteristics.  Last, we illustrate that two regulations recently
implemented by the management authorities should increase TE in the U.S. sea
scallop fishery.

Consolidation and transferability of days at sea limits is explored in

transferability.  It is only necessary to consider the notion of fishing power
or technical efficiency.  Fishing power and technical efficiency both indicate
some maximum level of potential harvesting or productivity.

There have been few empirical studies on the level of capitalization and
investment in fisheries because the necessary data are often inadequate. 
Specifically, data on capital stock and investment in a fishery are not
routinely collected and compiled or are limited in scope.  In this study, a
method is provided for estimating the aggregate capital stock and investment
in a fishery utilizing the available information.  Data on acquisition and
list prices and vessel characteristics for a sample of New England vessels are
obtained.  The data are then used to estimate an hedonic cost function which
specifies the acquisition price as a function of vessel characteristics.  The
resultant equations are subsequently used, with information on vessel
characteristics for all New England vessels, to estimate aggregate capital
stock and investment.  The results indicate that substantial investment363occurred in the otter trawl and scallop dredge fisheries, particularly since
the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act.  Moreover, the results
demonstrate that the number and change in the number of vessels are inadequate
indicators of the level of capital stock and investment in a fleet comprised
of vessels with heterogeneous characteristics.

Excess capacity of fishing fleets is one of the most pressing problems
facing the world s fisheries and the sustainable harvesting of resource
stocks.  Considerable confusion persists over the definition and measurement
of capacity and capacity utilization in fishing.  Fishing capacity and
capacity utilization, rather than capital (or effort) utilization, provide the
appropriate framework.  This paper provides both technological-economic and
economic definitions of capacity and excess capacity in fishing and
illustrates the technological-economic approach through a case study using
Data Envelopment Analysis.

This paper addresses the issue of defining and measuring capacity in

optimization from microeconomic theory.  The former definition is the focus of
this paper because of the paucity of cost data in most fisheries world-wide
militates against estimation of cost or profit functions to derive economic
measures of capacity and capacity utilization.  An empirical illustration of
capacity in the Malaysian purse seine fishery is provided as a case study.

Despite the extensive effort to research issues of allocative efficiency
in fisheries, little empirical analysis of technical efficiency (TE) in
fisheries exists.  This study examines vessel efficiency using a stochastic
production frontier based on a sample of sea scallop vessels operating in the
Mid-Atlantic between 1987 and 1990.  Estimates of TE are computed and compared
with input usage, resource conditions, economic performance, and recently
imposed regulations.  The analysis suggests that owners and captains only
partially compensate for changes in resource conditions through the use of
labor and fishing effort, and recent regulations may improve overall TE in the
short run.

Researchers have long recognized that entrepreneurial or managerial
skill is a major determinant of productivity or reason why production among
firms varies.  Yet, except for a few studies, differences in productivity and
output levels are usually attributed to plant configuration or scale.  More365important, there appears to have been few attempts to relate technical
efficiency to managerial skill.  Utilizing a stochastic production frontier,
we examine the relationship between technical efficiency and characteristics
of skill such as experience and education in a fishery.  Although we can not
determine threshold or essential levels of experience and education,
substitution possibilities are found to exist between years of experience and
education levels.  Additional analysis of efficiency for two captains of the
same background and experience reveals that additional characteristics need to
be considered in the examination of skipper skill or the  good-captain 
hypothesis.

Excess capacity is globally recognized by resource managers as a major
problem for fisheries.  Yet, the concept of capacity remains vague, ill-
defined, and often ambiguous.  Measuring capacity and capacity utilization in
fisheries has become more important or of greater public concern than ever
because of various national and international agreements or policies to reduce
capacity in fisheries throughout the world.  In this study, we offer
definitions of capacity and propose a method to calculate capacity, capacity
utilization, and optimum input utilization.  We illustrate the method by
estimating and assessing the capacity of ten U.S. northwest Atlantic sea366scallop, Placopecten magellanicus , vessels operating between 1987 and 1990. 
We conclude that the ten vessels had the capability to harvest considerably
more than they actually did, and the fleet could be reduced by 68% or more if
managers desire to match capacity to a recommended sustainable yield of 20
million pounds.

Participation and Bids in the Northeast U.S. Groundfish Fishing Vessel
Buyout Program.   Paper Presented at IIFET, Northeast Fisheries Science
Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, Woods Hole, MA.
An experimental buyout program was initiated in 1995 to remove fishing
vessels from the Northeast United States groundfish fishery.  Implemented as a
reverse auction, the purpose of the pilot program was to determine the level
of interest in a vessel buyout and to gain insight on the prices owners would
be willing to accept to surrender their vessel and all associated fishing
permits.  Of the 296 eligible vessels, the pilot program drew 114 applicants
with average bids of $455 thousand.  This paper describes the pilot buyout
program and the econometric procedures used to forecast probability of
participation and bids, and to estimate the number and types of vessels that
could be purchased at various levels of program spending.  The decision of
whether to participate in the program and the magnitude of bids were modeled
in two stages via the specification of a participation function and a bid
function.  Alternative methods for modeling these functions, such as the Tobit
model and the Heckman and Cragg two stage models, are discussed.  Variables
found to explain participation and bids include total and groundfish revenue
history, allocated days-at-sea in the groundfish fishery, gear type, expected
ranking, and vessel size characteristics.  The expanded buyout program,
completed in April 1998, provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the
accuracy of the forecasts.

Skipjack Tuna ( Katsuwonus  pelamis ): Estimating Parameters from Tagging
Data.   Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences , 51(12):2642-
2653.
From an experiment with ordinary dart tags, we have found evidence of
the effect of fish aggregating devices (FADs) and of islands on the movements
of skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus  pelamis ) around the Solomon Islands.  By fitting368a fish movement model to the tag data, we were able to estimate mortality and
movement parameters (including diffusivity), parameters of a function that
models FAD attraction, and a separate parameter of island attraction. 
Diffusivity was high enough to effectively distribute fish throughout the
island archipelago (approximately 150,000 km2) within a few months.  Estimates
of FAD parameters indicate the presence of up to four or five FADs in an area
approximately 50 X  50 km can reduce the propensity for skipjack to leave that
area by approximately 50%, but that deploying additional FADs in such an area
does not significantly increase their effectiveness in holding skipjack. 
Estimates of the island attraction parameter imply that the propensity of
skipjack for movement away from the archipelago is less than half the
propensity for movement within it.

Bank area of the Gulf of Mexico.  Handline fishing explorations by the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Caribbean Project provided the
basic data for assessment of the resources in the Caribbean Sea.  Exploratory
trawl surveys by the Pascagoula Laboratory of the National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS), NOAA and catch and effort data from the Cuban and Mexican
snapper fisheries provided the basis for the Campeche Bank assessments. 
Present production of snappers and groupers can probably be significantly
increased in many areas of the Caribbean, notably along the continental shelf
of northeast South America off the Guianas and the Central American shelf. 
One problem hampering increased production in some island communities is the
occurrence of ciguatera in fish in the northern Leeward Islands.  Production
for both snappers and groupers can be increased in the Campeche Bank area. 
Increased red grouper production can be realized by altering the age at entry
into the fishery from 3 to about 5 years of age and increasing fishing effort.

Review of the Offshore Shrimp Fishery and the 1981 Texas Closure."" 
Marine Fisheries Review , 44(9-10):16-30.
Prohibition of shrimp fishing within 200 miles of the Texas coast on 22
May 1981 resulted in large brown shrimp catches off Texas when the season
reopened on 15 July.  Catch per unit effort off Texas in late July and August
1981 ranged from 1,349 to 2,250 pounds per fishing day, compared with only 820
to 858 pounds per fishing day for the Louisiana offshore brown shrimp fishery. 
The July-August 1981 relative abundance (CPUE) off Texas was greater than
during similar time periods for any other year.  Shrimp caught and landed off
Louisiana were also predominantly smaller than those caught and landed off
Texas.
Recruitment from Texas bays to the offshore fishery appeared average to
good, but was not sufficient to account for the outstanding abundance levels
found offshore.  The closure of Texas waters to fishing appears to have been a
major reason for the large catches and high catch rates in July and August off
Texas in 1981.

This paper's purpose is to implement a methodology that can be used to
suggest a model (or models) appropriate for valuing quality improvements in
the Chesapeake Bay.  To compare these approaches, a series of outdoor
recreation user populations is constructed by choosing a utility function, its
parameter values and an error distribution.  This information is combined with
the characteristics of individuals and recreation sites from a Chesapeake Bay
recreation demand survey to solve the individual's maximization problem.  Each
of the models is estimated using these data, and the compensating variation of
a quality change is calculated.  Benefit estimates are compared with simulated
welfare change to evaluate the models.

Recreation demand models are commonly employed tools of economists
interested in valuing improvements in environmental amenities.  Despite their
importance, little comparative work has been undertaken to examine the ability
of the models to accurately estimate welfare changes.  A simulation study
designed to compare the reliability of estimated welfare measures
(compensating variation and consumer surplus) from several commonly employed

choice of functional forma nd model specification are important determinants
of the resulting estimates of benefits.

This paper presents a procedure for examining the reliability of welfare
estimates resulting from the estimation of multiple site recreation demand

combined with observations of individual and site characteristics to generate
simulated data sets.  Welfare measures associated with an improvement in site371quality are calculated.  Recreation demand models are estimated using the
simulated data sets.  Estimated welfare measures resulting from the recreation
demand models are then compared to the true welfare measures calculated from
the simulated data.  The procedure is demonstrated using two commonly employed
recreation demand models.

The original specification of the constant elasticity of substitution
(CES) production function was restricted to the case of constant returns to
scale.  If the CES production function is generalized to allow for the
possibility of nonconstant returns to scale require nonlinear regression
techniques or linear estimation using a Taylor series expansion around p=0. 
The latter technique is essentially a Cobb-Douglas production function with a
correction factor.  This technique is then applied to U.S. nonfarm data for
1947 to 1960.

In 1994, prior to the introduction of the individual fishing quota (IFQ)

vessel captains who had fished for halibut between 1987 and 1993.  The survey
included five questions about captains  expectations for and attitudes towards
the planned IFQ management system.  This paper reports on captains  responses
to these questions.

An open ended survey of halibut fishermen in the Alaskan fishery confirm
the positive effects of ITQ management and also indicates that attitudes
toward the program are inversely proportional to holdings of ITQ shares. 
These results remind us that management policies that may increase net
benefits of fisheries do not necessarily make all fishermen, or even a372majority of fishermen, better off.  This can contribute to strikingly
different perceptions of the same management policies among different
fishermen.

Allocation between commercial and sport fisheries is becoming an
increasingly difficult and divisive issue in fisheries management.  As
conflicts over allocation have increased, so has interest in the relative
economic contributions of commercial and sport fisheries.  This paper
describes eight basic issues in economic comparisons of commercial and sport
fisheries.  These basic issues should be considered in evaluating or planning
any economic comparison of commercial and sport fisheries  - from a back-of-
the-envelope comparison to a formal study.  We illustrate these issues by
describing how they arose in an economic caparison of commercial and sport
fisheries for Alaska s Kenai river sockeye salmon.

A study was conducted to determine species composition and weights of
fish taken during trawling for shrimp by the commercial fishery in Georgia's
close inshore waters.  For all species combined and considering the state as a
unit, the average pounds per hour of trawling had a large seasonal variation. 
The months of January, March, April, October, and December all averaged less
than 100 pounds per hour of trawling with December the low month at about 29
pounds followed by March at about 52 pounds.  In all remaining months the
catches averaged over 120 pounds per hour of trawling with peaks in May at 245373pounds and in November at 192 pounds.  Four families of fish each represented
3 percent or more of the yearly average catch over the state.  These are
Sciaenidae 73.8 percent, Clupeidae 8.5 percent, Dasyatidae 3.6 percent, and
Ariidae 3.3 percent -- a combined total of 89.2 percent of the yearly average
catch.  The Sciaenidae contributed 95.0 pounds per hour of trawling, Clupeidae
10.9 pounds, Dasyatidae 4.7 pounds, and Ariidae 4.3 pounds or a combined total
of 114.9 pounds of the yearly average of 128.8 pounds per hour of trawling. 
Nine species of fish were captured in greatest abundance over the state and
together contributed 111.6 of the 128.7 pounds per hour of trawling and
represented 86.4 percent of the yearly average catch.

Two methods are examined for regulating stock externalities under
uncertainty; quotas and taxes.  Dynamic programming is used to characterize
the externalities precisely.  The accuracy with which the current size of the
resource stock can be monitored is found to be of crucial importance in the
choice between tax and quota regulation.  If the current stock is observed
without error, taxes are capable of outperforming any quota.
Koenig, Evan F. (1984).  ""Fisheries Regulation Under Uncertainty: A
Dynamic Analysis.""  Marine Resource Economics , 1(2):193-208.
This paper considers alternative methods for regulating the stock
externality in a common property fishery.  The methods considered are fiat
price controls, a quota on the fish catch, and taxes on the size or value of
the fish catch.  When regulations must be formulated on the basis of
incomplete information, these methods are not equivalent.  It is shown that
taxes are the preferred regulatory instrument whenever the regulatory
authority is able to accurately monitor the size of the fish stock.

Kouka, Pierre-Justin (1995).   An Empirical Model of Pricing in the Catfish
Industry.   Marine Resource Economics , 10(2):161-169.
The adoption of aquacultural products has created an imbalance of market
power between catfish producers and a processing sector that exerts a
monopsonistic power in certain regions of the U.S. such as west Alabama. 
However, because of the recent changes caused by vertical integration of the
catfish industry, the existence of an oligopolistic power has been identified
in the catfish industry.  An empirical model of pricing in the catfish
industry was developed using a theoretical model proposed by Appelbaum.  An
analysis of the market structure was conducted to provide estimates of
conjectural elasticities over time.  Conjectural elasticities were used to
construct the oligopoly power index.  Results show some evidence of the
existence of oligopolistic power in the catfish industry that further suggests
some degree of price enhancement.

""Characteristics of the Texas Shrimp Fleet, 1979-82.""  Marine375Fisheries Review , 46(2):53-59.
Sound management of the Texas shrimp fishery requires an understanding
of the composition of the shrimp fleet and its response to changing economic
conditions and regulations.  This study utilized Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department licensing data to quantitatively describe and evaluate the
commercial fleet from 1979 to 1982.  Tables representing the number of vessels
in the fleet, the license (bay, bait, Gulf) or license combinations that they
maintain, the home ports of vessels, and the counties of residence of vessel
owners, are presented.  Despite yearly fluctuations, the shrimp fleet has been
increasing, as have been the purchases of single and multiple licenses. 
Decreases in the number of vessels in the fleet for any given year resulted
primarily from vessels less than 25 feet in length and vessels 55-70 feet in
length leaving the fishery.  The expansion of the fleet in 1981 and its
relationship to 1981 fisheries legislation is discussed.

Sociobioeconomic Model : The Texas Inshore Shrimp Fishery."" 
Ecological Modelling , 35:275-307.
A sociobioeconomic model (SBM) of the Texas inshore shrimp fishery is
developed as an extension of a General Bioeconomic Fisheries Simulation Model
(GBFSM) for annual crop fisheries.  The SBM is a heuristic model which
redefines the traditional concept of a vessel class to include social and
cultural variables that describe the vessel operators.  Sociocultural
variables that are hypothesized to affect harvesting capability of fishermen,
or relative fishing power (RFP) of vessels that they operate, are identified
and referred to as Fishing Advantage variables.  Fishing Advantage variables,
age of operator, years of experience, and innovativeness, are quantified and
incorporated into the GBFSM through modification of an equation that
calculates RFP for different SBM vessel classes.  Sociocultural variables
hypothesized to affect decisions of vessel operators to exert fishing effort,
or nominal days fished (NDF) are identified and referred to as Motivational
variables.  These include deferred gratification orientation, work
orientation, and vessel ownership status of the vessel operator.  A method
using decision trees to direct decision making based on Motivational variables
and economic feedback is incorporated into the GBFSM to adjust NDF for
different vessel classes.  Five idealized inshore vessel classes representing
different types of Texas inshore shrimp vessels, whose operators differ in
Fishing Advantage and Motivation, are included in the SBM.  Examination of the
performance of individual inshore vessel classes indicated that policy changes
have different economic impacts on different groups of fishermen, with revenue
and rent of the lowest producers being most sensitive to policy changes.

The effect of taxation on depletion is examined when ore quality varies
within a deposit and the firm's selection of the sequence of exploitation is
constrained.  Tax policies in this setting are less conserving of the resource
than if ore quality is homogeneous and can be less conserving of the resource
than in other models of ore quality selection.  For example, a constant
severance tax can induce faster depletion, decrease the life of the mine,
reduce total recovery, and increase metal output in periods when extraction is
positive.

After examining the properties of several alternative forms of
marketable permit systems for the control of air pollution, this paper
proposes a system of pollution offsets as the most promising approach.  Under
the pollution offset scheme, sources of emissions are free to trade emission
permits subject to the constraint of no violations of the predetermined air
quality standard at any receptor point.  The paper shows that the pollution
offset system has the capacity to achieve the predetermined standards of air
quality at the minimum aggregate abatement cost, while making comparatively
modest demands both on the sources and on the administering agency.

The new globalization initiatives place increased faith in the role377played by market forces.  They have created euphoria about the ability of a
regime of vigorous and free international trade in food products to solve
problems of food security.  Achieving food security depends crucially on the
level of both physical and economic access to food by the needy.  Trade is
therefore only one facilitating factor, and fish composes only a small part of
the food basket.  Both enhanced trade and food security depend substantially
on the content, the quantum and the distribution of economic growth within and
across countries.  The role of trade and fish in food security must therefore
not be overrated, and when examined in isolation, done so with caution.  What
contribution can fishery products make in moving humanity from the reality of
widespread food insecurity to the vision of a world free from hunger?  Does
international trade in fishery products, in the manner in which it is
organized today, play a role in alleviating food insecurity directly or
indirectly?  If not, under what conditions can it do so in the future?  We
need to ponder over these issues.

Clark s bioeconomic model is applied to Antarctic minke whales (AMW),
the backbone of the commercial whaling in 1982 when the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) opted for a ban on whaling commencing 1985/86.  The
moratorium appears not to be justified from the point of view of saving AMW
from extinction or for maximizing the net present value of returns to whalers. 
Catch quotas before the moratorium are found to be lower than needed for
survival of the species and for sustainability of the harvests and returns. 
It seems that the IWC catch quotas and the moratorium were determined not by
conventional bioeconomics, but by other factors such as political pressure
form conservationists who suffered adverse externalities from whaling. 
Nevertheless, even taking such externalities into account, the present
moratorium seems not to be Kaldor-Hicks optimal.

The purpose of this study was to determine an aggregate demand function
and the factors influencing the demand for fish in Indonesia during the period
1967-88.  Using a Box-Cox transformation methodology, the double-log model was378found to be appropriate for explaining the demand for fish.  Results of static
analysis showed an own-price of -0.102, a cross-price elasticity for eggs of
0.271, and an income elasticity of 0.506.  A dynamic analysis using a
Houthakker-Taylor model indicated that fish consumption depended on
psychological food buying habits of consumers.  Short run and long run
elasticities, resulting from a partial adjustment model, implied that per
capita consumption of fish is growing at a slow rate.

Investment strategies for Indonesian shrimp aquaculture were evaluated. 
Three strategies: intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive production systems,
and four scales of operation: small scale (2 ha), medium scale (5 ha), large
scale (10 ha), and extra large scale (30 ha) were examined.  Capital budgeting
techniques were used to determine the system and scale that were most cost
effective for the industry.  All systems showed positive net present values
and had acceptable internal rates of return.  The 2 ha and 5 ha semi-intensive
were the most cost effective with or without financing.  The intensive
strategy is less attractive for 10 ha production programs compared to the 10
ha and 30 ha semi-intensive.  The results showed that net present values and
benefit to cost ratios increased with farm sizes, but internal rates of
returns (IRR) were the highest for 2 ha and 5 ha semi-intensive farms.

Integrability of incomplete demand systems is discussed.  The  concepts
of weak integrability, quasi-expenditure function, quasi-indirect utility
function, and quasi-utility function are defined.  Their relationships to the
expenditure function, indirect utility function, and utility function are
developed.  The dual structure of the quasi-functions permits exact welfare
analysis and reveals the conditional preference structure for the commodities
of interest.  New results relating the uniqueness and exactness of consumer's
surplus to the structure of the expenditure and indirect utility functions are
obtained.379Labisky, Ronald F., Douglas R. Gregory, Jr., and Joseph A. Conti (1980). 
""Florida's Spiny Lobster Fishery: An Historical Perspective."" 
Fisheries , 5(4):28-37.
The Florida based fishery accounts for 98 percent of the spiny lobster
landed commercially in the United States; this catch is comprised almost
exclusively of the Florida spiny lobster, Panulirus  argus.  The commercial
lobster industry began in the lower Florida Keys during the early 1800's
principally as a bait fishery that supported the local finfish industry. 
Subsequent developments in the lobster fishery have essentially mirrored the
prosperity of Key West.  In 1908, landings totaled about 53,000 pounds that
were valued at $3,600.  The fishery began to exhibit progressive expansion in
the 1940's, a trend that continued through the 1970's.  A sport (diver)
fishery for lobsters that began in the 1950's has also gained prominence. 
Commercial landings in Florida, including catches from international waters,
peaked in 1972 at 11.4 million pounds.  The peak in ex-vessel landings value,
$13.4 million, was attained in 1974.  The strong international fishery that
developed during the 1960's was severely curtailed in 1975 by the closure of
Bahamian fishing grounds to foreign fishing.  Domestic catches from Florida
waters declined slightly during the 1970's, despite a substantial increase in
fishing effort.  Retrospectively, the spiny lobster has not only strongly
impacted the culture, sociology, and economics of south Florida, but has also
emerged to rank second only to shrimp as Florida's leading fishing industry.

Vessels: 1971.""  Departmental Technical Report No. 74-1, The Texas
Agricultural Experiment Station, Texas A&M University, College
Station, Texas, January, 36 pp.
This study is an analysis of expected vessel costs, returns, and
economic implications of alternative shrimp price situations.  Costs and
return estimates were based on 1971 data taken from 29 vessels separated into
two classifications: (1) 53 to 65 foot and (2) 66 to 72 foot.  Annual landings
of shrimp were 41,551 and 56,933 heads-off pounds for small and large vessels,
respectively.  Total annual variable cost was $30,031 for small vessels and
$51,632 for large vessels.  Based on an expected 20 year life and 1971 vessel
costs, annual fixed cost was $8,144 and $10,421 for small and large vessels,
respectively.  Gross revenue was $46,800 for smaller vessels based on a price
of $1.13 per pound and $69,869 for large vessels based on a price of $1.23 per
pound.  The resulting net per vessel was $8,625 and $7,816 for small and large
vessels, respectively.  The investment analysis indicated that the internal
rate of return for a small vessel was 24 percent without external financing
and 50 percent with normal financing arrangements of an 80 percent loan at 8
percent interest for 6 years.  This compares to an internal rate of return for
large vessels of 7 percent without financing and 32 percent with the financing
arrangement described above.

March, 54 pp.
The results of an economic survey of small northeast fishing vessels
using otter trawl gear is described.  The population consisted of 572 persons
who were holders of groundfish permits, had fishing vessels of 65 feet or
less, and who reported catches in New England using trawl gear in 1996.  A 10
percent response rate was achieved from a mail survey of a questionnaire that
generated 35 usable responses from a probable population of 420 fishermen. 
The results of our mail survey of small trawlers are presented in eleven sets
of tables and 4 sets of figures.  Each table summarizes quantitative data
responses by providing two or more measures of central tendency (the mean or
 average , the median, and the mode), and two measures of variability (the
standard deviation, the standard error of the mean, the skewness, and the
range).  The Count on total respondents for each question is also provided as
an indication of the reliability of the results.

Landings for the Central Coast of South Carolina.""  North American
Journal of Fisheries Management , 9:12-22.
A stock recruitment relationship (SRR) was developed for white shrimp
Penaeus  setiferus  in the central coastal area of South Carolina.  The SRR is a
Beverton-Holt type curve for which May and June commercial fishery landings
represent stock and August-January landings represent recruitment.  A
variable, August salinity in Charleston Harbor, was selected by the stepwise
regression process, and it was combined with the Beverton-Holt equation to
produce a model that explained 86.8% of the variation in August-January
landings.  The final model was used to develop a family of SRR curves in which
each curve corresponded to a different salinity.  This model was sufficiently
robust to forecast below average, average, and above average fall landings
from readily obtainable data collected in spring and summer.  These findings
support South Carolina's existing management strategy of protecting spring
spawners as much as possible after severe winter weather when the brood stock
has suffered heavy mortality.

There has been a trend toward intensification of shrimp farming in the
U.S.  Fifteen simulated farms were used to evaluate economies of scale and to
compare three Penaeus  vannamei  commercial production strategies: semi-
intensive, intensive, and very intensive.  Large economies of scale were
associated with each production strategy.  Over the range of farm sizes
considered, investment cost per hectare decreased approximately 50% and
production cost decreased approximately 25%.  Farms' returns were measured
with Internal Rate of return (IRR).  When investment was greater than $0.75
million, the intensive strategy provided slightly better returns to the
investor than semi-intensive or very intensive strategies.  At investment
levels less than $0.75 million, the semi-intensive strategy provided the
highest IRR.

Costs, returns, and economies of scale for small, medium, and large
catfish farms with recirculating ponds are presented for the upper Texas
coast.  Internal rates of return are 0.150, 0.183, 0.219, respectively.  Total
investment is higher than farms with static ponds but investment per unit
production capacity is 7 percent to 16 percent lower.  Average total cost per
pound is between $0.565 and $0.541 (11 percent - 20 percent lower than farms
using current technology).  These results have implications for regional
comparative advantage of catfish production as well as incentive for adoption
of new technology in conventional ponds.

Lane, Daniel E. (1986).  ""A Partially Observable Model of Decision
Making by Fishermen.""  Working Paper 86-46, University of Ottawa.
This paper presents an application of a partially observable Markov
decision process for the intraseasonal decisions of fishing vessel operators. 
Throughout each fishing season independent vessel operators must decide in
which zone or fishing ground of the fishery to fish during each period to
catch the most fish with the highest return to fishing effort.  Fishermen's
decisions are assumed to be made to maximize net operating income.  The
decision model incorporates the potential catch of fish, the cost of fishing
effort, and the unit price of fish.  Catch potential is modeled by considering
the abundance of the fish stock and the catchability of the fishing technique. 
Abundance dynamics not directly observed are modeled as a Markov chain with a
parsimonious state space representation that renders the problem practicable. 
Dynamic decision policies are computed by the method of optimal control of the
process over a finite horizon.  The resultant policies are used to simulate
distributions of fishermen's net operating income, fishing effort dynamics,
and catch statistics.  The model may be used as a decision aid in the
regulation of the common property fisheries resource.
Lane, Daniel E. (1987).  ""Investment Decision Making by Fishermen."" 
Working Paper 87-20, University of Ottawa, March.
This paper develops and applies a model of investment decision making by
fishermen.  The results of the model present an accurate picture of actual
investment decisions and provide valuable insights into the behavioral basis
of investment decision making by fishermen.  Understanding the investment
decisions of fishermen has implications for planning and regulation in
fisheries.  Insights gained into the key factors behind fishermen's investment
decisions provide the basis for the development of strategic long term
policies that anticipate fishermen's behavior.  The consequences will be a
movement away from reactive, short term policies that have characterized
fisheries regulation to date.  Individual fishermen make investment decisions
in an environment that is competitive and highly variable from season to
season.  Extensive variability means that economic survival must be a primary
consideration in the investment decision process.  In this paper fishermen's
investment decisions are modeled as a probabilistic dynamic programming
problem in discrete time.  Fishermen are assumed to make rational decisions
based on income expectations and subject to survivability conditions to
maximize the net worth of fishing enterprise at the end of a finite planning
horizon.  The formal analysis of the investment model is presented and the
model is applied to troller fishermen of the British Columbia commercial
fishing fleet.

The consequences of exploitation of either or both of a pair of
competing species are examined using the Lotka-Volterra equations.  The
removal of a fixed proportion of a population on an instantaneous basis shifts
the equilibrium population sizes for both the exploited species and its
competitor.  Similar shifts occur when both species are exploited.  The
maximum sustained yield of a species can be estimated under various degrees of
exploitation of its competitor.  The maximum combined sustained yield can be
estimated for various relative values of the two species.  From this analysis
it is observed (1) harvesting only one species may provide a mistaken
underestimate of capacity for sustained yield, (2) harvesting two species but
relating yield to the fishing mortality rate of only one of the two may give a
misleading overestimate of further capacity for sustained yield.  Similar
conclusions can be drawn if exploitation rate is proportional to abundance.

Several surplus production models are estimated for Florida s commercial

compare selected biological parameters including the intrinsic growth rate,

University, Newport, Oregon, August.
An empirical bioeconomic model of the Pacific whiting fishery is
developed to illustrate the inefficiency of  calendar independent  policies
for managing stocks that display physical variation within seasons.  The model
uses the characteristics of the harvested product to link biological
information with the economics of production.  The socially optimal short run
management plan jointly regulates the intra season harvest pattern and quasi-
property rights allocation.  The distinct effects of these regulations are
examined using sensitivity analysis.  Results indicate that society benefits
from harvest plans that consider intrinsic characteristics by regulating the
timing of harvest within each season.  Moving from an early to a later season
fishery increased 3-year net present value from U.S. $36.5 million to $66.4
million due to greater biological growth and higher product recovery rates
associated with improved intrinsic quality of the fish.  Results also show a
conservation effect for both the resource stock and the ecosystem.  In
addition, the magnitude of benefits are robust to the allocations held by
onshore and offshore sectors.  This analysis offers insights for improving
fisheries management.

Aside from the determination of harvest levels, contemporary management
of many species is dominated by concerns for the economic well-being of the
harvesters, especially when there are several competing heterogenous harvest
groups.  Fisheries managers, therefore, often overlook the biological and
economic effects of seasonal physiological changes in individual fish cohorts. 
For many marine species, these changes can affect harvest yields, processor
recovery rates, and quality characteristics of processed products.  Ignoring
these factors can lead to smaller socks and harvests, increased costs, lower386valued products and significant losses in regional and national welfare.  The
Pacific whiting ( Merluccius  productus ) fishery serves as a case study to
understand the importance of pre-harvest fish quality and fisheries management
including the determination of annual, seasonal, and user group quotas.  A
bioeconomic programming model is used to evaluate the relationship between the
various quota strategies and management goals of stock conservation, economic
value, and maximum utilization.

Returns to the U.S. Atlantic Pelagic Longline Fleet in 1996.   SP98-9,

of Florida, Gainesville, FL, June, 44 pp.
Logbook trip and set summary data collected by the NMFS are analyzed for
commercial U.S. pelagic longline vessels that participated in Atlantic pelagic
fisheries in 1996.  These data are augmented with the U.S. Coast Guard vessel
database to incorporate vessel characteristics.  Average fish weights and
prices from NMFS observers, licenced seafood dealers, and the Fisheries
Statistics and Economics Division, respectively, are used to estimate gross
revenues.  This revenue is compared to average reported cost and earnings
information.  Comparisons by vessel and trip types are also made.  The
Atlantic pelagic longline fleet consisted of 259 vessels that landed (e.g.,
offloaded for sale) approximately 240,000 fish (more that 30 species) in 1996. 
Each vessel average 12 trips during which they placed five sets (each with, on
average, 632 hooks over 25 miles).  The average trip lasted 10 days and
grossed $10,270.  Supply costs averaged $4,708 for fuel, bait, light sticks,
ice, and groceries, and $2,623 for miscellaneous expenses.  The total crew
payment averaged $3,903 ($1,055 per crew member).  In addition, vessel owners
and captains (if not the owners) received $4,422 and $1,521, respectively. 
This analysis suggests considering the fleet as heterogeneous by vessel length
and the number of sets per trip based on cost and revenue calculations. 
Disaggregating the fleet by vessel size (e.g., length) and fishing behavior
(i.e., number of sets per trip) may be necessary to account for significant
differences in reported landings and estimated financial returns. It may be
especially important to incorporate these differences into management
decisions when considering proposed changes in fleet and fisheries
regulations.
Larson, Douglas M. (1993).   Joint Recreation Choices and Implied Values of
Time.   Land Economics , 69(3):270-286.
A model of joint recreation quantity choices is developed.  Individuals
choose both total time spent at distant sites and the number of trips taken,
implicitly choosing average on-site time.  The model permits nonzero marginal
utility of travel, makes on-site time endogenous, and is linear in the
constraints.  The scarcity value of time is analyzed without assuming the
marginal utility of work time is zero.  A partially testable assumption about
relative marginal values of travel and on-site time yields nonparametric387calculations of the scarcity value of time and marginal values of trips and
days on-site from people s observed optimal quantity choices.

The prevailing consensus that existence value can only be measured by
contingent valuation is questioned.  The concern is over  pure  existence
value, a change in welfare when a public good changes that leaves no trace in
behavior.  Pure existence value may well be more a consequence of the simple
models used to characterize nonuse value than a reflection of how people value
public goods.  If so, nonuse value can in principle be obtained from observing
behavior as well as from asking questions, which offers a prospect for cross-
checks and corroboration using both approaches.  Some possibilities for
empirical measurement are suggested.

Linear programming based models of individual multispecies groundfish
operations in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands area are developed and applied
to the question of determining efficient bycatches.  The policy tool is
halibut quotas, which restrict the bycatch of halibut and also induce changes
in the target species catch composition and bycatch of other prohibited
species.  Efficient quotas can be interpolated from the locus of shadow values
for discrete halibut quotas relative to the opportunity cost of prohibited
species bycatch induced by the policy set quotas on halibut bycatch.  Because
of information limitations intrinsic to fisheries management, the efficient
halibut quotas are considered in the context of ranges of marginal value and
marginal opportunity cost developed using short and long run groundfish
fishery models and standard error estimates of opportunity cost.

Lean, Judith and David Rind (1996).  ""The Sun and Climate."" 
Consequences , 2(1):27-36.
The Sun is almost certainly implicated in some of the climate changes of
the past, and may today affect, to some degree, the weather from year to year. 
Yet, were it the only agent of climatic change, we would live in a world where
the mean global surface temperature varied, in any century, through limits of
at most about 0.5o C.  We are not yet able to predict those changes, beyond
what is now known of the Sun s much smaller, eleven year variation.  Over
longer scales of time, possible changes in solar radiation could modify the
warming that has been projected in mid range, consensus IPCC models for the
end of the next century by at most about 25 percent.  Our understanding of
solar variations needs to be extended if we are to refine these estimates to
the level of most of the other climatic variables on which current projections
are based.

The present stock assessment concludes that the black drum population in
the gulf is healthy; however, states should continue to monitor their
fisheries to maintain a conservation standard that is at least equivalent to a
20% SSB/R ratio.  States should adopt gear restrictions, size limits, bag
limits, seasonal quotas or other restrictions as needed, and they should work
cooperatively to enact regulations that are consistent among states to the
maximum extent possible.  All fish should be landed whole, with heads, tails
and flesh naturally attached, and only licensed commercial fishermen should be
allowed to sell drum.  State should also evaluate the impacts of regulations
and their effects on solving problems and accomplishing management objectives. 
This evaluation should include effects on black drum from restrictions used to
protect other fisheries.

Seasonal closures in the western gulf are estimated to have increased
gulf wide yield of Penaeus aztecus by 9% in 1981 and 6% in 1982.  Monitoring
spring water temperatures and salinities allows some degree of accuracy in
predicting annual abundance of this species.  Salinities about 10 parts per
hundred and temperatures above 20 degrees C are favorable.  Benefits of
management of P. duorarum in the eastern Gulf are less clearly defined, and

Restriction on U.S. vessels access to former foreign fishing grounds and
increased imports from mariculture may require a reassessment of the

Relative sea level change at a particular location is primarily the sum
of global change and local change in land elevation.  Published values for sea
level rise vary from 0.5 to 3 mm per year reflecting active local uplift or
subsidence. Screening these data, it can be shown that long term tide gauge
records measure the same underlying trend of sea level change.  For planning
and engineering purposes, government officials and decision makers should
utilize the one meter benchmark because this estimate is well within the

Availability of a common unit of measurement, such as lower jaw fork
length (LJFL), is often used for partitioning the catch into age groups for
age based stock assessments.  In the U.S. fleet, swordfish ( Xiphias  gladius )
are processed for the commercial market at sea.  The processing used involves
the removal of the head, viscera, gills, and caudal fin of the carcasses.  In
addition, whole weights cannot be measured on landed fish.  Because the recent
ICCAT agreement for a minimum size swordfish of 25 kg, whole weight,
predictive relationships between the commonly available measurements for the
U.S. landings were needed.  For these reasons, length-weight and length-length
relationships were derived from data collected by at sea observers and
volunteer crew members aboard cooperating swordfish vessels to allow
conversion form carcass length (CK) to LJFL and CK to dressed (DWT) and whole
weights.

policy (i.e. TAC direct and bycatch quotas) to proposed policies in terms of

Analysis of Proposed Regulations in the U.S. North Atlantic Swordfish
Fishery.   Staff Paper SP 98-10, Institute of Food and Agricultural

Gainesville, Fl, June, 56 pp.
A bioeconomic programming model was developed for the North Atlantic
swordfish ( Xiphias  gladius )fishery to examine the effect of alternative
management schemes.  The model uses population dynamic equations obtained from
the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)
and characteristics of the domestic fleet as reported to National Marine
Fisheries Service (NMFS) in 1996.  The model chooses the annual harvest level
and domestic fleet size that maximize the net present value of returns to the
U.S. commercial fishery across a five-year time horizon ( which corresponds
with the ICCAT management time line).  The model explicitly includes
conservation measures.
Results indicate that five-year economic returns to the U.S. Atlantic
longline fishery (discounted at ten percent annually) can be increased by
reducing fleet size or by lowering the mortality of incidentally caught
juveniles.  Domestic policies aimed at reducing juvenile mortality may
increase biomass in subsequent years and benefit the entire industry. 
Regulators need, however, to jointly consider such policies since an increase
in stock size may be able to support a larger domestic fleet (which would
contrast with proposed limited entry policies.).

Models: A Monte Carlo Comparison.   Draft report, Alaska Fisheries
Science Center, NMFS, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA, 23 pp.
There is currently much national and international interest in measuring
commercial fishing capacity.  Two quantitative methods that will likely be392used for this purpose are data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic
frontier (SF) production functions.  Although both methods can be used to
estimate a production frontier, their underlying assumptions and method of
solving for the frontier are quite different.  Once substantial difference is
how each model handles noisy data.  An understanding of the implications of
this difference is important because random variation is likely to exist in
commercial fishery catch data.  This research uses Monte Carlo simulations to
investigate possible finite sample biases attributable to this type of noise. 
The results suggest that the mean bias associated with noisy data is often
substantially larger for DEA than SF.  However, the frequency distributions of
the biases from each method show a wide variation in some cases.

The delta method treats values as a two part process, the probability of

results within each strata produces an alternative estimate of CPUE and thus
annual bycatch.

Although data on Great Lake fish stocks and values are uncertain
estimates, reasonable approximations can be made concerning economic losses
for the United states from various types of management practices.  Based on
biometric changes that are projected to occur, it appears that early control
of a nonindigenous fish species, specifically ruffe ( Gymnocephalus  cernuus ),
can result in significant investment returns.  By instituting a ruffe control
program, benefits to the public will exceed costs by 44 to 1 over the next
five decades.  Under a moderate case projection of benefits this will yield an
estimated net public savings of $513 million for the United states.  Since
sportfishing values are much greater than commercial fishing values, anglers
will benefit the most from this program.

The study develops a theory of very short run forward looking behavior
allowing for forward trading and storage of final good and material input. 
Production and storage are separable from hedging decisions and depend only
upon current forward and cash prices.  Comparative statics are derived
regarding production, purchases, and sales.  The hypotheses advanced are

Results suggest that in sort run equilibrium futures prices of the soybean

Economics of Exhaustible Resources.""  Canadian Journal of

The paper provides some extensions of Hotelling's fundamental paper on
the economic theory of exhaustible resources.  One of the main modifications
introduced in the paper concerns the assumption of complete versus incomplete
exhaustion of the resource.  Under complete exhaustion the concept of full
marginal cost must include a term that reflects the alternative cost of
producing an extra unit at the terminal time.  Under incomplete exhaustion
this term vanishes.  To derive these results, we present a novel formula for
the full marginal cost of extracting exhaustible resources.  Also, the
principle that marginal profit has to increase over time exponentially at a
rate equal to the interest rate (r percent rule) is shown to be valid only
under special conditions.  The modifications to this rule are discussed.
Levhari, David and Leonard J. Mirman (1980).  ""The Great Fish War: An
Example Using a Dynamic Cournot-Nash Solution."" The Bell Journal
of Economics , 11:649-661.
In recent years there have been numerous international conflicts about
fishing rights.  These conflicts are wider in scope than those captured by the
model presented in this paper.  Yet the model sheds light on the economic
implications of these conflicts as well as on the implications of other
duopolistic situations in which the decisions of the participants affect the
evolution of an underlying population of interest.  Our model has two basic
features: the underlying population changes as a result of the actions of both
participants, and each participant takes account of the other's actions.  This
strategic aspect is studied, for an example, by using the concept of a
Cournot-Nash equilibrium in which each participant's reaction depends on the
stock of fish and not on previous behavior.  Thus, the model is a discrete-
time analog of a differential game.  The paper examines the dynamic and steady
state properties of the fish population that results from the interactions of
the participants.

In this paper a simple framework will be provided in which many
important results new to the literature can be derived.  One bonus of this
approach is that much of the previous literature can be organized and
rationalized.  The simplicity of the mathematics has the effect of revealing
the underlying economic intuition of the subject.  Throughout the paper the
self renewing resource will be referred to as fish.  However, it should be
clear that the analysis is perfectly general in that it can be applied to any
self renewing resource.  In fact, by specializing the production function, and
elementary exposition of the theory of exhaustible resources is implicit.

The exploitation of a nonrenewable natural resource, such as petroleum
or mineral ores, is analyzed in a stochastic framework with price uncertainty. 
The market setting may be either monopolistic or competitive.  We demonstrate
that the rate of extraction varies directly with the resource owner's
willingness to accept risk.  Risk preferring owners use the resource more
rapidly than risk neutral owners, who in turn deplete the resource more
rapidly than risk averse owners.  It is also seen that the usual practice of
increasing the discount rate to account for risk induces a more rapid rate of
resource use when in fact a slower rate of depletion is desired.

Shrimp Baiting Fishery.""  South Carolina Marine Resources Center,
Technical Report Number 81, April, 25 pp.
This study s purpose was to develop some basic economic information
concerning the recreational shrimp baiting fishery.  Specific objectives
include determining the socio-economic characteristics of licensed
recreational shrimpers, analyzing factors affecting recreational shrimping
trips, and estimating the economic values of shrimp baiting trips by the
direct questioning method.  Total gross economic values of shrimping trips in
1991 were estimated at $1.9 million, while total net economic values were only
$236 thousand.  The analysis of commercial and recreational shrimping
relationships indicated that the commercial shrimp landings were independent
of the level of recreational shrimping harvest.  Therefore, commercial and
recreational shrimping activities can coexist even if the gross economic value
per pound was lower from recreational shrimping.

This paper is about property rights, the public interest, and our

issues for insight about our discipline and profession.  The parallels lead to
certain recommendations essential to our professional survival, an important

debate, two cases where good intentions for resource development produced
major environmental damage (irrigating the desert and draining the
Everglades), and cases where changing human values have created resource
issues (use of public lands and wetland protection).  Then I will briefly
mention farm policy in this context of changing values.

The Navajo Tribal Council and the Navajo Range."" Economic Inquiry ,
18:69-86.
The article argues that chronic overgrazing on the Navajo Reservation is
the result of policies of the BIA and the Tribal Council.  In support of that
hypothesis the paper outlines the nature of property rights to grazing land on
the Reservation.  It shows that BIA and Tribal Council actions have led to the
proliferation of small herds since 1933.  Small herds increase the resource
costs of establishing and enforcing property rights, and they increase the
political costs of requiring compliance with grazing rules.  Statistical tests
reveal a close relationship between herd size and overstocking of the range. 
The paper concludes that in the absence of the constraints of a private
property system, it may be necessary for an outside agency to regulate grazing
to avoid the problem of the Commons.

This paper addresses the impact of the number and heterogeneity of

contracting success varied sharply.  On some fields, agreements were quickly
reached and effectively enforced, while on others compliance was never
achieved.  We show the firm heterogeneities that led to different bargaining

We develop a model of regulation of environmental risks in a

become more stringent and as aversion to uncertainty grows.  Taxes are more
equitable than standards whenever the emissions generating the risks are all-

Analysis of the Ex-vessel Demand for Pacific Halibut.""  Marine
Resource Economics , 4:305-314.400Throughout its history the North Pacific halibut fishery has experienced
dramatic changes in season length-most recently a greater than tenfold
decrease during the last fifteen years.  This analysis estimates the effect on
ex-vessel halibut demand of season length by incorporating it with other more
traditional explanatory variables such as landings, cold storage holdings, and
prices of substitutes in a price dependent demand analysis.
Ex-vessel demand is found to be price elastic; thus management programs
that increase catch will also increase gross fishing revenues.  Cold storage
holdings have an inverse relationship to ex-vessel price.  Since the level of
cold storage holdings decreases as the fishing season approaches, the date of
the first opening will affect the ex-vessel price.  Finally the length of the
halibut season does have a positive relationship with ex-vessel price;
management strategies, such as limited entry, that increase season length will
increase ex-vessel demand.

The use of individual transferable quotas for bycatch (IBQ) or target

discard, and underutilization problem in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering
Sea/Aleutian Islands groundfish fisheries.  The objective of this report is to
provide information that can be used to design and evaluate such programs by
summarizing the nature and effectiveness of environmental protection programs
that include the use of marketable rights.  As policy makers begin to examine
the use of marketable permits as a solution to other environmental management
problems such as fisheries bycatch regulation, these results underscore the
importance of assuring that unnecessary constraints are not imposed in future
trading applications.

The different economic incentives presented in the open access and
community development quota (CDQ) pollock fisheries is examined.  Several
hypotheses are tested as to the expected differences in vessel performance
under both types of systems.  Among the measures of performance were
groundfish discard rates, prohibited species bycatch rates, product value per
unit of catch, pollock catch per unit of fishing effort (CPUE), dollars per
metric ton of pollock catch, and pollock catch per hour of fishing.  Overall,
conditions in a CDQ fishery support a more efficient utilization of resources
in the pollock fishery and could be effective in addressing the problems of
discards and bycatch in the groundfish fisheries off Alaska.

Risk analysis can be defined as the evaluation of the probability of end
events interpreted in terms of sequences of earlier events.  In fisheries
science, stock assessment provides future projections on which management
decisions can be based.  Uncertainties in estimating input parameters for such
projections are considerable.
For the assessment problem, we propose an event tree analysis that
couches the uncertainty of projections in terms of relative risk associated
with various management options.  As an illustration, we rephrase the stock
assessment advice given in 1980 for the Georges Bank haddock stock
(Melanogrammus  aiglefinus  l.) in the framework of event tree analysis.  This
method is also examined for a second species: the Gulf of Mexico menhaden
(Brevoortia  patronus ).  We also evaluate the results and their sensitivity
relative to choices of end events.

Market.""  National Economics Program, Office of Data and

Washington, D.C., August, 12 pp.
This study is an attempt to explain the large increase in U.S. swordfish
imports in 1985 and 1986, and to project changes in the swordfish market to
1995.  An historical review of the swordfish markets shows that prior to 1971,
the swordfish market depended mainly on imports.  In 1971, high concentrations
of mercury were discovered in swordfish.  This led to Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) inspection and potential seizure of swordfish that is
imported or transported across state lines.  FDA inspection requirements and
the negative consumer response resulted in a almost complete collapse of the
swordfish market.  However, enough swordfish demand remained so that the price
of swordfish landed and marketed in the same state rose substantially after
1971.  The high ex-vessel price stimulated the expansion of the domestic
swordfish fishery, as imports remained minimal until 1980.  From 1981 to
present, swordfish demand has continued to grow from increased consumer
incomes and also from the fact that consumers have appeared to forget about
the high mercury concentrations discovered in 1971.  In 1985, imports surged
to a level slightly higher than the level in 1970 and appear to be even higher
in 1986.  This recent increase in imports and the continued high level of U.S.
landings is being sustained by a new surge in consumer demand for high value
fishery products.  Projections to the year 1995 indicate that the U.S.
swordfish market will continue to grow as consumer incomes and the population
increase.  As U.S. landings level out, the continued growth in the market will
be met by increased imports.
Lipton, Douglas W. (1986).  ""The Resurgence of the U.S. Swordfish
Market.""  Marine Fisheries Review , 48(3):24-27.
This paper will attempt to explain the current trends in the U.S.402swordfish market and to project changes to 1995.  To understand how the
discovery of mercury contamination affected the swordfish market, historical
trends are examined from 1965 to 1985.  Using this time period, a regression
model is used to estimate the demand for swordfish.  The model incorporates a
feature that allows the mercury discovery to affect the demand for swordfish
in the year that it was discovered and subsequent years.  However, as time
progresses, the model allows the impact of the mercury discovery to lessen as
consumers forget.  Thus, the model is used to make projections in a period
where mercury levels are no longer perceived as a factor in swordfish demand.

Fishing costs are dependent on the size of the fish stock and
regulations.  Changes in these factors alter the equilibrium industry
structure.  In a multiproduct fishery, it is not possible to generalize how a
reduction in industry catch will be accomplished, through a reduction in catch
per vessel or in the number of vessels.  Multiproduct cost functions are
estimated for the Atlantic clam fishery.  Simulations reveal that optimal403harvest would be achieved with an increase in the number of vessels and a
decrease in the catch per vessel of surf clams and an increase in the catch of
ocean quahogs.

Quarterly figures may be required when only a series of annual data are
available.  If no assumption about the pattern of the quarterly figures can be
made, so that merely a smooth trend must be obtained, a very simple procedure
can be employed to obtain a fairly good adaptation of the quarterly figures to
the annual totals.  For each year t, the value of a quarterly figure is
considered as a weighted average of the totals of the years t-1 and t+1. 
After introduction of some quite natural conditions a system of equations is
obtained, from which the weighting coefficients can be calculated.  To a
certain extent the solution contains some arbitrary aspects, but it has the
advantage of simplicity, plausibility and practical usefulness.

Models are developed to examine the behavior of optimal exploration and

exploration control and possesses four phases of the exploitation cycle. 
Explicit sets of conditions are established that (i) give rise to a U-shaped
price path, and (ii) determine when additions to reserves from exploration are404greater than or less than extraction, and when exploration creases.  Three
alternative specifications of the principal model are considered, and with a
separable benefit function it is shown that a higher discount rate lends to a
lower level of cumulative exploration.

The walleye pollock ( Theragra  chalcogramma ) is a semi-pelagic gadid
species that dominates the directed groundfish catches in the eastern Bering
Sea and Gulf of Alaska.  Two approaches have been taken to evaluate the impact
of other predators on the walleye pollock population in each area; an
integrated catch at age model and major predator food habits information. 
Both methods show the dominance of groundfish predation as a source of
mortality for young walleye pollock.  Cannibalism is most important in the
eastern Bering Sea while predation by arrowtooth flounder is highest in the
Gulf of Alaska.  In both areas, explicitly including predation mortality in
our assessment of walleye pollock stock size tends to increase our estimates
of number at age for prefishery juvenile pollock.  Further insights into
predator feeding responses and factors affecting pollock recruitment into the
fishery are gained through examination of predation data.

This paper traces the evolution of snow crab fisheries science and its
impact on the management of the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence snow crab
(Chionoecetes  opilio) fishery.  This currently lucrative fishery (estimated
landed value of more than 100 million Canadian dollars in 1994) has
experienced the traditional rises and falls of most fisheries and the
resulting socioeconomic consequences and sometimes strained relations between
the industry and the fisheries management agency, in this case the Canada
Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO).  Of note at this time is the
remarkable degree of cooperation that has developed between the industry and
DFO since the stock last drastically decreased (1987-1989).  Since then the
stock has been recovering steadily and is also better managed.  The reasons
for this are four-fold: 1) a recruitment pulse of small sized crab occurred in
1988-89; 2) substantial advances in the understanding of the complex biology
of snow crab and the development of an accurate, reliable stock assessment
methodology together have provided consistent, reliable, and credible advice
for forecasting the amount and geographic distribution of exploitable biomass405for the upcoming fishing season; 3) the industry leaders worked very hard with
their associations to convince fishers that their fishery was in peril and
that close cooperation with DFO was the key for the future; 4) the industry
and DFO worked as partners to develop a management approach based upon
scientific advice to climb out of the trough.  The paper also outlines the
conundrum that fisheries managers currently face resulting from a combination
of a moratorium of the entire Gulf of St. Lawrence groundfishery, the
consequent pressure from displaced groundfish fishermen to enter the lucrative
snow crab fishery and an optimistic short term but pessimistic longer term
forecast regarding snow crab abundance; do we redistribute the wealth; if so
among whom, how, and for how long?

Publicly owned natural resources under certain management regimes can
generate rents that could be captured by taxes or user fees for the resource. 
Under an ITQ program, those who are initially allocated the ITQ receive a
windfall when they sell their market shares.  Those who enter the fishery by
buying shares receive a windfall when they sell out equivalent to the
difference between their purchase price and their selling price (a capital
gain in equity).  The royalty payments under this example are based upon the
generation of rents.

economic loss in fishery benefits from future timber harvests on 86,700 acres406is estimated to be $1.7 million over a 30 year period.  The approach employed
in this paper overcomes previous shortcomings in valuing marginal changes in

that contains fish catch as a site characteristic.  Site specific marginal
values per salmon and steelhead caught are derived using this technique.

The consistency of an individual's willingness to pay (WTP) responses

populations) is tested along three lines.  First, we test whether WTP for 50%
and 100% increases in whale populations are statistically different form zero. 
Second, we ask whether the incremental WTP from a 50% increase to a 100%
increase is statistically significant.  Finally, we test whether there is
diminishing marginal valuation of the second 50% increment in gray whale
populations.  The paired t-tests on open ended WTP responses supported all
three sets of hypotheses.  Both visitors and households provided WTP responses
that were statistically different from zero and increased (but in a
diminishing fashion) for the second increment in WTP.  In this survey both
visitors and households provided estimates of total economic value (including
nonuse or existence values) for large changes in wildlife/fishery resources
that were consistent with consumer theory.

A bioeconomic model of a commercial Pacific salmon fishery is
constructed.  The economic sector focuses upon the seasonal harvesting process
in a gauntlet fishery while the biological sector deals with the long term
reproductive and growth processes of the fish population.  The sectors are
linked by the biotechnical harvesting process (unharvested fish escape to
spawn) and by the specification of an intertemporal objective function.  It is
shown that a fishery constrained only by the economic incentives of its sole
owner is unlikely to lead to stock extinction; that substantial excess
capacity exists in the fishery; and that successful economic exploitation
requires that attention be paid to species makeup.

Red swamp crayfish ( Procambarus  clarkii ) is a valuable renewable

Crayfish can cause severe crop damage by burrowing in fields and using
irrigation systems to spread.  These crayfish are resistant to normal dosages
of pesticides which are harmful to fish and birds, can endure months of
dryness, and live in a low oxygen environment.  This paper presents a simple
bioeconomic model for optimal use of the red swamp crayfish accounting for its
value in consumption, adapting Plourde s (1970) model to include the negative
externalities.

Economic losses or costs are ascribed to acquisition of catch and escapement
data in such a manner that an optimal data acquisition scheme can be defined
in addition to defining the set of optimal management strategies.

data that can be used to formulate and maintain an optimum management

taken to be the strategy that minimizes the Bayes risk.  Specific functional
forms are assumed where necessary to obtain a closed form expression for the
Bayes risk.  The Bayes risk, in units of numbers of fish, can then be computed
for any particular sequence of fishery management decisions.

Lott, John R., Jr. (1987).  ""Licensing and Nontransferable Rents."" The
American Economic Review , 77(3):453-455.
Traditionally, restrictive licensing is assumed to create monopoly
profits by restricting output and therefore to produce two kinds of social
costs: the deadweight loss due to reduced output and the resources devoted to
rent seeking.  However, the fact that nonsalvagable resources spent on rent
seeking create their own barriers to entry has not been recognized.  By
increasing nontransferable rents, licensing prevents the least costly
producers from entering and thus produces a third kind of social cost.  While
Harold Demsetz (1982) dismissal of the traditional notion of entry barriers is
correct when assets are transferable, the idea of entry barriers is still
useful when assets are nontransferable as this note shows in the case of
professional licensing.

information necessary to evaluate the management options suggested by the
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.  The early development of the plan was
guided by the goal of maximizing the economic benefits of the fishery to
Louisiana and the region.  Subsequent review of the draft plan by the
Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission's Shrimp Management Committee
resulted in refining the set of feasible management actions and a elaboration
of the management goals.  After review by the committee, public comment was
solicited.  The final product of this process is a set of proposed actions to
be addressed by the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission and the
Louisiana Legislature in the future management of the fishery.

survey (June-December 1985), 2) a public launching ramp creel census (June
1985 - May 1986), and 3) a public launching ramp drop-box survey (November
1985 - 1986).  Results from the tackle shop questionnaire provided information
on fishing modes and activities, boat and access site utilization, reactions
to licensing of marine recreational fishermen, and constituency perceptions of
problems associated with marine sport fishing.  Results from the on-site
surveys furnished data on species preference, catch, catch rates (CPUE),
length composition of red drum and spotted seatrout catches, and site
utilization.

Our lack of understanding and inability to predict mandate a much more
cautious approach to resource exploitation than is the norm.  Political

policies upon a misguided view of the dynamics of resource exploitation. 
Scientists have been active in pointing out environmental degradation and
consequent hazards to human life, and possibly to life as we know it on Earth. 
But by and large the scientific community has helped to perpetuate the
illusion of sustainable development through scientific and technological
progress.  Resource problems are not really environmental problems: They are
human problems that we have created at many times and in many places, under a
variety of political, social, and economic systems.

The relationship of natural marsh-estuarine systems to the economic
productivity of marine systems is not well understood, at least in any
quantitative sense.  An approach is developed for relating blue crab economic
productivity on Florida's Gulf Coast to marsh availability in the area. 
Previous efforts have not always applied economic concepts appropriately in
attempts at such quantification.  The marginal value productivity of marsh is
shown to vary with alternative levels of marsh and effort in the fishery.  The
interaction and subsequent interdependence is shown to be statistically
significant.  Data availability on marginal response to marsh changes poses a
severe obstacle to further progress.

pp.410Water is a difficult resource to allocate because of its common pool
characteristics that lead to co-interference.  As a result, a wide variety of
decision forums - judicial, legislative, executive/administrative, special
purpose districts, and markets - are used in various mixes in the U.S.  In
Florida, only the market forum is not used.  The reasonable beneficial use
standard in Florida suggests the necessity for economic and efficient
utilization while still reducing interference and satisfying the public
interest.  Markets facilitate pursuit of mutual gain (i.e., economic
efficiency) in trades.  Markets are valuing processes that create incentives
to save water (e.g. to reuse) and to avoid degrading water quality so that
more can be sold.  Proportional shares in the safe yield could be marketed. 
The water districts would specify the water quantity associated with each
share.  Districts and governing boards would still be charged with defining
tolerable interference and ensuring the public interest considerations are
satisfied by administered markets.  Such markets will be helpful in
determining what is a reasonable beneficial use.

The economic and social milieu of the commercial fisheries in the
Atlantic provinces of Canada is described, followed by an analysis of the
structure of the major sector, the fishery based on the demersal stocks of the
region.  Existence of the classic features of mature fisheries, i.e.
congestion and economic distress, is established for this fishery and the
causes considered.  Extended national jurisdiction over the use of fishery
resources, it is argued, while it improves opportunity for development, does
not affect those causes.  Possible approaches to rational management of the
fishery are reviewed, in particular the institution of inducements for fishing
enterprises to minimize production costs.  A discussion in this respect of
quasi property rights for resource users and associated problems concludes the
paper.

The Mid-Atlantic surf clam fishery is the only example on the east coast
of the United States of a ""limited entry"" marine fishery.  Since 1977, it has
been managed with a moratorium on the number of vessels plus quotas and effort
limitations.  This study investigated the socio-economic impacts of limited
entry and related management measures (including restricted fishing time) in
the surf clam fishery and the closely related ocean quahog fishery.  It also
investigated the social and cultural dimensions of the management process
leading, at the end of this study period, to a decision to change from limited
entry to quasi-privatization through individual transferable quotas (ITQs).

The surf clam fishery of the mid-Atlantic experienced a sharp decline in
resources in the mid-1970's and impressive increase in clam populations by the
mid-1980's.  Public response to the former, triggered by a severe anoxic
condition and near disaster in 1976, was to impose strict regulations on the
fishing fleet and create limits on the number of vessels.  Response to the
latter has been to impose even stricter regulations and to move toward a
privatized limited access regime.  We show how social structure within the
fishing industry affects the management process.

The best known revisionist perspective on the so-called  tragedy of the

important in contributing to understanding of conditions in which collective
action for common benefits, with respect to common pool resources, can take
place.  Characterizing this perspective as a  thin  or abstract, generalizing
explanatory model, with strengths and weaknesses thereby, we discuss a
 thicker  or more ethnographic perspective that emphasizes the importance of
specifying property rights and their embeddedness within discrete and changing
historical moments, social and political relations.  We argue that this
perspective leads to a focus on  community failure  rather than  market
failure  as the presumed cause of environmental problems, and hence, to
questions about how markets, states, and other external and internal factors
affect the capacities of communities and user-groups to respond adequately to

We examine aspects of labor in the harvesting sector of the surf
clam/ocean quahog industry of the mid-Atlantic region of the United States in
the context of limited entry.  Vessel owners are both diversifying and cutting
back on labor costs through crew consolidation in response to difficulties in
the sea clam industry.  A survey of crew-members on job satisfaction reveals
more about the preferences and experiences of labor.  We make predictions
about the fate of labor under a new management regime based on individual
transferable quotas.  The analysis is intended to bring the interests of crew-
members in to the decision making process and to improve the basis for
predicting how future regulatory measures may affect crewing.

The politics of conservation is dealt with in several ways.  The first
concerns the politics of deciding for or against major institutional change. 
In the U.S., Canada, and Norway, attempts to create so called ITQs, or414individual transferable quotas, in major commercial fisheries have been
fraught with delay and controversy, largely because of the distributional
issues raised by privatization and recourse to market based regulation.  The
second concerns the structure of decision making, and in particular how user
groups and their interests and concerns are and are not brought into the
decision making process.  The third concerns the distributional effects of
changes in fisheries property rights and how people respond to them.  In this
paper, we touch upon aspects of these topics with particular emphasis on the
hypothetical intersection of privatization and comanagement.

Economists can help improve resource allocation by applying their
evaluation techniques to marine recreational fishing.  In this paper, two
approaches to evaluation are reported: the travel cost method and the hedonic
price method.  The two approaches are similar in that they rely on observed
behavior rather than responses to hypothetical questions.  They differ in the
extent to which they assume an individual can control his environment.

The paper studies the problem of congested recreation facilities when
the users differ with regard to their willingness to pay for access to the
site and their aversion to congestion.  The simple model of the paper shows
that some user groups may actually increase their use of a site if they are
less price responsive and more averse to congestion than the central
tendencies of all users.  These results help explain many administrators'
reluctance to use fees to ration entrance to congested sites.  Under plausible
assumptions about the effects of income on price and congestion
responsiveness, the use of a fee would tend to ration sites toward people with
higher incomes.

The debate over the use of contingent valuation for existence values or
passive-use values has failed to explore the validity of motives for such
values.  One potential motive, altruism, has conflicting implications for
benefit-cost analysis, depending on whether the altruist is paternalistic. 
This paper constructs models of three types of altruism and shows how benefit-
cost analysis responds to each type of altruism, how damage assessment and
restoration depend on each type, and the implications of heterogeneous
altruists.415McConnell, Kenneth E. and N.E. Bockstael (1984).  ""Aggregation in

This paper addresses the aggregation issue for estimating the demand for
outdoor recreation.  The basic theme is that regardless of how they are
estimated, individual behavioral parameters should be used for welfare
measurement.  The first part of the paper treats appropriate estimation
techniques for data sets that are aggregated over individuals; the zonal
travel cost model.  The second part explores and reviews models of individual
behavior that incorporate changes in participation as well as changes in the
number of visits that may confound welfare estimates.  The plausibility of
benefit estimates could be substantially improved if greater care were given
to the extrapolation of benefits calculated from a sample to aggregate benefit
estimates for the population.
McConnell, Kenneth E. and Virginia A. Duff (1976).  ""Estimating Net
Benefits of Recreation Under Conditions of Excess Demand."" 
Journal of Environmental Economics and Management , 2:224-230.
The public provision of outdoor recreation necessitates the development
of nonmarket measures of the value of resources in recreational use.  Such
values can be used as surrogates for market values in the decision-making
process.  Another aspect of recreation as a publicly provided good is the
absence of a mechanism to eliminate automatically excess demand.  The absence
of such a mechanism has resulted in conditions of excess demand at many
recreation sites.  This paper deduces the implications of excess demand for
the travel cost method of benefit estimation.  We show that when excess demand
results in rationing at a particular site, the travel cost method will
underestimate the true benefits of the site.  The results are important
because they help identify the direction of bias of one measure of the
benefits from the use of a natural resource.

This paper investigates the social returns to commercial fisheries when

rights to the fishery is necessary to realize potential benefits from cleaner
water and healthier fish stocks.  In fact, we show that cleaner water can
reduce the social returns from the production of fish products if common fish
stocks exist.

The theory of recreational fishing is developed and conditions are
derived for optimal management policy, with special attention given to
functional relationships that must be empirically verified.  Determinants of
the optimal allocation between commercial and recreational fishing effort are
derived.  The theory is extended to include selected peculiar features of
recreational fishing: Some anglers sell their catch; a small proportion of the
fishing population accounts for a large proportion of the catch; and anglers
throw back a fraction of what they catch.  Optimal policies are derived under
these more realistic conditions.

When discounted stumpage price is constant, the optimal harvest length
increases over time if establishment costs increase more rapidly than the

optimal harvest length decreases over timber if establishment costs increases
less than the discount rate.  Third, whether the optimal harvest length
increases or decreases depends on the type of yield function.

This projects goal is to document the value of marine resources derived
from recreational fishing from New York to Florida.  Sportfishing has economic
value in that anglers would be willing to pay more for their opportunities
than they actually have to pay.  The value of opportunities for recreational
fishing will depend on many aspects of the opportunities-the quality of
fishing, the weather, the skill of the angler, and so forth.  There are two
kinds of economic values of interest: a) the access value, what anglers would
pay rather than do without access to the resource; and b) the value of a
change in the quality of fishing, what anglers would pay for increments in
fishing characteristics, such as the catch rate.

The paper examines the impact of regional variation in environmental
regulations on industry location decisions for one industry; automobile
production.  The focus is on location decisions in the 1970's, that was a time
when there was some regional variation in environmental regulations in this
industry, at both the county and state level, and when the costs of complying
were sufficiently large that they might affect location decisions.  Using a
conditional logit model, we determine the regional factors important in firm
location decisions for this industry, including various county and state
measures reflecting the stringency of environmental regulations.  We find no
evidence that environmental regulations deter firm location in this industry
when regulations are measured by a simple distinction between areas in
attainment of ambient ozone standards and those not in attainment.  There is
some indication, though that the degree to which an area is out of attainment
matters.  Urban areas that are severely out of compliance with standards are
less likely to be chosen.

seatrout populations have slowed or stopped since the prohibition of sale of
these species in September 1981.  However, the full effect of the regulations
may not be evident for 3-5 years because spotted seatrout and red drum do not
spawn until they are 3-5 years old.  In addition, the effect of these
regulations has been hampered by the coast wide fish kill documented in
December 1983 and January 1984.  Reduced population levels of red drum,
spotted seatrout and black drum due to this freeze were observed in the 1984
spring gill net catch rates.

This paper outlines a general procedure for formulating econometric
models of population choice behavior from distributions of individual decision
rules.  A concrete case with useful empirical properties, conditional logit
analysis, is developed in detail.  The relevance of these methods to economic
analysis can be indicated by a list of the consumer choice problems to which
conditional logit analysis has been applied: choice of college attended,
choice of occupation, labor force participation, choice of geographical
location and migration, choice of number of children, housing choice, choice
of number and brand of automobiles owned, choice of shopping travel model and
destination.

Diagnostic tests for omitted variables or functional misspecification in
the multinomial logit (MNL) model can be performed conveniently by testing the
significance of auxiliary regressions of residuals on included and excluded
variables.  In particular, Lagrange Multiplier (LM) and Hausman-McFadden (HM)
tests of the Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) Property on the
MNL model can be carried out by the regression method using suitably defined
excluded variables.  Using this method, it is straightforward to test jointly
against several sources of misspecification and to diagnose the structure of
deviations from the MNL model.

The empirical literature on fisheries economics has largely ignored the
concept of supply, concentrating instead on the specification of production
functions.  While it has been recognized that overexploitation of a fishery is
an economic problem, the supply behavior of the industry has not been
seriously examined.  It is intended here to develop a model where effort, the
index of inputs used in most production models, is determined endogenously
rather than assumed to be exogenous.  The consequence of this is that landings
will be determined by economic rather than purely physical factors.

An economic and investment analysis was performed to determine the
viability of bait-shrimp farming in Texas.  A single pond analysis producing 5
- 5.5 g shrimp always had higher returns above selected cost (RASC) than
producing 4 - 4.5 g shrimp.  Stocking 0.01 g shrimp had a higher RASC than
stocking 0.25 g, 0.50 g, or 0.75 g shrimp.  In the 20 pond analysis, which
accounted for marketing considerations, stocking 0.25 g shrimp had the highest
RASC.  The investment analysis, assuming average management, was declared
bankrupt by the end of the fifth year.  Under ""excellent"" management the
internal rate of return was only 11.7%.  It is unlikely that bait-shrimp
farming will become a viable industry in Texas in the near future.

This paper develops a model with assumptions similar to the linear model
for use when the observed dependent variable is ordinal.  This model is an
extension of the dichotomous probit model and assumes that the ordinal nature
of the observed dependent variable is due to methodological limitations in
collecting the data that force the researcher to lump together and identify
various portions of an otherwise interval level variable.  The model assumes a
linear effect of each independent variable as well as a series of break points
between categories for the dependent variable.  Maximum likelihood estimators
are found for these parameters along with their asymptotic sampling
distributions and an analogue of R2 (the coefficient of determination in
regression analysis) is defined to measure goodness of fit.  The use of the
model is illustrated with an analysis of Congressional voting on the 1965
Medicare Bill.

The fishery is a prime example of a common property renewable resource

harvested a single species or aggregation, but now powerful multipurpose
vessel have been introduced that switch targets as opportunities arise.  These
vessels represent an adaptation to the fluctuating environment: they give up
efficiency of specialized operations for flexibility under changing
conditions.  We analyze, from the point of view of economic efficiency, the
common property operation of a mixed fleet of generalist and specialist
fishing vessels in a fluctuating environment.

Finally this procedure is contrasted with the Pearce and McKenzie approach

The individual transferable quota and similar fisheries programs are

qualified fisherman is given the right to harvest a select portion of the
total allowable catch.  This paper provides an overview of select ITQ fishing
systems and proposed systems currently underway in five different countries
including the United States.  Since there already exists ample biological
resource data on the various systems, this paper emphasizes international
fishing quota programs from an enforcement perspective.

This paper investigates the short and long term biological and economic
consequences of risk averse fisheries management strategies.  In particular,
what circumstances are necessary for conservative strategies to outperform
less conservative and risky strategies in terms of stock size, yields, and

however, the potential effects on cumulated yields and discounted revenues are
less obvious.

The benefits of the current ICCAT minimum size regulation for Atlantic
swordfish (125 cm LJFL or 25 kg round weight, with 15% tolerance by number)
were examined in terms of the gains in yield per recruit (YPR) and spawning
per recruit (SPR), and the risks of recruitment overfishing.  Sensitivity
analyses showed that smaller minimum sizes combined with zero tolerance could
result in comparable levels of YPR and SPR.  However, in all cases the SPR
based on recent (1991) fishing mortality rates is small relative to the level
required for population replacement.  Reduced risk of recruitment overfishing
will require either a much larger minimum size, much improved survival of
undersized returns, or lower fishing mortalities overall.

Relationships between various biological reference points (BRPs) used to
define thresholds and targets of fisheries management strategies were examined
for a range of combinations of life history characteristics.  Rank orderings
of the selected BRPs were strongly influenced by the degree of density
dependence in the underlying spawning-recruitment (S-R) relationship.  The
validity of F 0.1, Fmax, and F 20%(the fishing mortality at which spawning per
recruit is 20% of the maximum), and other reference fishing mortality rates as
approximations to F msy or as thresholds of over fishing is highly dependent on
life history characteristics, particularly the degree of density dependence in
the S-R relationship.  It is recommended that F 40% be adopted as a target
fishing mortality rate when the S-R relationship is unknown and that threshold
levels of biomass be related to the estimated or assumed degree of density
dependence in the S-R relationship.  Two new methods of calculating threshold
biomass levels are suggested as alternatives to the familiar 20% B 0 rule.

greater than at maximum sustainable yield.  But, results can be different if
the model is modified to include fish schooling or aggregation, discount rate,

This article explores contemporary debates over property rights in

debate surrounding the privatization of harvesting rights in the halibut and
sablefish fisheries off Alaska is used as a case study.  The public trust
perspective guides a new reading of the Alaska debate offering insight into
current conceptualizations of both property rights in fisheries and the public
trust doctrine itself.  A contextual analysis of the early public trust
doctrine reveals a strong symmetry between the debate over the early doctrine
and that over the Alaska fisheries.  both are debates over fundamental ideas
regarding the interrelationships between natural resources, rights, equity,
progress, and nationhood.  A public trust-driven reading of the Alaska debate
reveals how much our ideas about rights, and consequently about the public
trust doctrine itself, have changed.  In our quest for environmental
preservation we have all but abandoned earlier public trust doctrine in
exchange for the malleability of current articulations of the doctrine.

 Bioeconomics and Catchability: Fish and Fishers Behaviour During Stock
Collapse.   Fisheries Research , 31:11-17.
During periods of stock collapse, an increase in the catchability
exhibited by many small pelagic fish is a consequences of two factors: their
schooling habit and the remarkable efficiency of today s technology intensive
fishing fleets.  The net result is that a virtually constant catch per unit
effort may be achieved regardless of stock size.  Three models of catchability
used to highlight the consequences of fish behavior and fishing technology427during stock collapse are extended to examine the effects of incorporating
profit motivated economic behavior of fishers.  Three scenarios are examined:
(1) cooperation by fishers to achieve maximum economic yield (MEY); (2) non-
cooperation resulting in open access equilibrium; (3) non-cooperation with
allocation subsidies allowing fishers to increase effort beyond the open
access equilibrium.  Incorporating economic behavior in the density-dependent
catchability models may result in an alarming increase in the rate of stock
depletion, since fishers maintain high profits even during low stock
abundance. We discuss the consequences of using a model where catchability is
assumed constant for the management of fisheries on small schooling pelagic
fish.

A five year review of listed species is required under section 4 of the

summarized in this review by NMFS, and an assessment is made of the current
status of the populations of sea turtles that are listed pursuant to the
Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA).  The leatherback sea turtle ( Dermochelys
coriacea ) and hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys  imbricata ) were listed as
endangered throughout their range on June 2, 1970.  The population of Kemp's
ridley ( Lepidochelys  kempi) was listed as endangered on December 2, 1970.  The
green sea turtle ( Chelonia  mydas) was listed on July 28, 1978, as threatened
except for the breeding populations of Florida and the Pacific coast of Mexico
that are listed as endangered.  At the same time, the loggerhead sea turtle
(Caretta ) was listed as threatened wherever it occurs.  These sea turtles were
listed because, to varying degrees, their populations had declined as the
result of human activities.  Many of their nesting beaches had been destroyed
by encroachment of the human population into coastal habitats.  Sea turtle
populations had been reduced by uncontrolled harvesting for commercial
purposes and by mortality incidental to activities such as commercial fishing. 
In many cases, existing regulatory mechanisms were not providing sufficient
encouragement for conservation.

on 3,935 proposals requiring federal permits or licenses to alter wetlands.  A
survey of 977 of these activities revealed that 359,876 acres of wetland s
that support fishery resources under NMFS purview were proposed for some type
of alternation or manipulation.  Almost 95 percent of this acreage was for
impounding and or manipulation of water levels in Louisiana marshes.  The
National Marine Fisheries Service did not object to alternation of 173,284
acres and recommended the conservation of 186,592 acres.  To offset habitat
losses, 1,827 acres of mitigation were recommended by the NMFS or proposed by
applicants and/or the Corps of engineers (COE).  From 1981 to 1988 the NMFS
has provided indepth analyses on 8,385 projects proposing the alteration of at
least 656,377 acres of wetlands.

Fisheries Review , 48(3):1-8.
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is quantifying the
cumulative acreage of habitat involved in the Corps of Engineers' (COE)
programs relating to water development in the Southeast Region of the United
States.  From January 1981 through December 1985 the NMFS commented on 23,292
proposals to alter wetlands that had been submitted to the COE.  Of these,
detailed habitat information was obtained on 5,385 projects involving the
potential alteration of 184,187 acres of wetlands.  Dredging was proposed for
over 80,227 acres and 45,893 for filling, 5,846 for draining, and 52,222 for
impounding.  NMFS did not object to the alteration of 48,500 acres and
recommended the conservation of 135,687 acres.  The proposed habitat losses
were potentially offset by the 110,406 acres recommended for mitigation.  The
degree to which our recommendations were incorporated into permits by the COE
also was documented.  NMFS recommendations were accepted overall 50 percent
off the time, partially accepted 24 percent of the time, and rejected 26
percent of the time.  Applicant compliance with permit conditions averaged 80
percent.  NMFS recommendations on permit applications are made by the
Southeast Regional Office and its area offices, but are dependent on up-to-
date research information provided by research laboratories of the Southeast
Fisheries Center.  The close link between these facilities in NMFS fisheries
habitat conservation efforts is described.

This study focuses on estimating demand for Atlantic salmon sport
fishing in New England.  Sport fishing demand is modeled as a function of
attributes of salmon fishing opportunities, and characteristics of salmon
anglers.  Models with level of interest variables and motives for fishing give
better out of sample predictions than models with demographics and models with
site attributes.  Providing a number of assumptions hold, optimization results
indicate that it would be economically viable to rear adult Atlantic salmon
for a sport fishery..

This paper explores the experience of New Zealand in implementing a
comprehensive quota management system to cover a multispecies fishery
including crustacea and shellfish.  In particular it explores the pressures
that have come to bear on the fisheries management process in terms of the
Government s goal to create an economically efficient and effective
conservation regime for the New Zealand fisheries.
The paper will explore the conflicts that arise between industry and
Government on the setting of total allowable catches, bycatch allowances, the
allocation of quota, the establishment of the system and the interrelationship
between conservation, recreational and commercial fishing groups.
The paper will also suggest a range of mechanisms that might be suitable
to overcome the difficulties that New Zealand has experienced in the
implementation of its quota management scheme.
Malvestuto, Stephen P. and Michael D. Hudgins (1996).   Optimum Yield for
Recreational Fisheries Management.   Fisheries , 21(6):6-17.
Optimum yield (OY) calls for fishery professionals to deliberately and
meaningfully incorporate biological, economic, and social values into fishery
management decision making.  This invitation eventually will require a large,
multidisciplinary data base for a fishery, but that reality is in the distant
future.  For now, OY compels us to consider a paradigm shift.  The new
paradigm would require decision makers to choose a list of essential variables
that would be examined and weighed in concert before developing management
plans.  Here, we present four OY management accounts (biological,
sociocultural, economic, and human health) as the conceptual framework for
this OY data gathering.  Depending on the mix of user groups, each management
account would generate several important variables that should be considered
as a starting point for OY decision making for a fishery.  The suggested data431can be obtained easily through routine creel surveys.  Our reconceptualization
of OY is intended to shrift the content and focus of recreational fishery
management plans toward evaluating and promoting diverse sociocultural
benefits to anglers and communities.

We study the effects on fisherman decision processes of periodic (e.g.,
weekly) individual quotas.  In the model, the fisherman must choose at the
start of each week on which of two grounds to fish.  The catch per week on
each ground is a random variable and the fisherman does not know with
certainty the parameters of the distribution of that variable.  He does have
estimates on each parameter and can improve these estimates by Bayesian
updating.  The choice of a fishing ground takes into account the expected
catch on that ground and the expected improvement in information from fishing
on that ground.  Our study is concerned with the effect of weekly quotas on
the joint production of information and fish.  Various policy implications are
discussed, and the results are compared with the policy analysis of Clark
(1980) in the deterministic case.  We know that the quota affects the value of
information and that if quotas are transferable, then the quota may limit its
own value.

Tag Recoveries: Distribution, Habitat, and Method of Recovery."" 
Marine Fisheries Review , 50(3):24-32.
The Kemp's ridley sea turtle head start research project is an
international conservation effort to increase the wild population of Kemp's
ridleys and to create a second nesting beach on Padre Island, Texas.  Turtles
are reared in captivity for about 10 months, tagged, and released at various
locations in the Gulf of Mexico, but primarily off Padre Island.  Tag
recoveries are summarized by distribution, method of recovery, habitat, and
season.
A total of 12,422 turtles from nine year classes (1978-86) of Kemp's
ridleys have been released since the project began in 1978.  As of 31 December
1987, 547 (4.4 percent) tag recoveries have been reported.  Tag recovery data
show turtles were reported from Mexico, all of the Gulf Coast states, and most
of the states on the U.S. east coast as far north as New York.  A few tag
recoveries were reported from France and Morocco.  Primary recovery locations
are Texas (60.9 percent), Louisiana (14.0 percent), and Florida (10.3
percent), and primary tag recovery methods include strandings (34.4 percent)
and shrimp trawls (27.6 percent).  Tag recovery habitat data show that
occurrence in bay waters or ocean waters is about equal with 45.8  and 31.8
percent, respectively.  Kemp's ridleys probably move into bays and shallow
coastal areas to feed.  Seasonally, 52.5 percent of the tag recoveries occur
during April, May, and June.

being considered to control incidental catch in the US fishery conservation
zone of the Bering Sea.  The evaluation is in terms of the ability of
management to minimize the impact and control costs of incidental catch.  The
authors conclude that the use of economic disincentives tends to be preferable
due to the inefficiencies and extensive information requirements of the
alternative options.

""Bycatch: A Bioeconomic Assessment of North Pacific Groundfish
Fisheries.""  Draft Report, ICES, MSM Symp/No. 31.
In its early years, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council spent
considerable time setting catch quotas and dividing them between foreign,
joint venture, and domestic fisheries.  Conservation of stocks and the
development of a United States groundfish fishery were the main concerns
during this period.  Expansion of United States groundfish fisheries has
increased the contentiousness of allocation decisions.  One of the most
politically volatile allocation issues is the catch of nontarget species
(bycatch) in the groundfish fishery, particularly by trawlers.  Mathematical
programming techniques are use to explore this issue.  Models constructed
contain both biological and economic components.  Costs and benefits of
controlling bycatch in both target and nontarget fisheries are examined.

With the present state of knowledge of red tides, particularly in

occur more often.  It appears that at least five major factors are responsible
for this blessing.  These are: (1) environmental stress, (2) enemy organisms,
(3) currents and other hydrographic factors, (4) possibly critical-nutrient
limitation, and (5) photodynamic action.  The significance of these factors
are reviewed as a guide to potential management strategies.

Management Council, National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast
Fisheries Science Center, Galveston Laboratory, 4700 Avenue U,

Excess bycatch in shrimp trawls is seen as an important cause for
declines in stocks of some commercially important finfish, endangered sea
turtles, and other living resources in the Gulf of Mexico.  Measures to reduce
bycatch have been proposed to alleviate such declines.  These measures may
have the effect of releasing more shrimp predators or allowing small fish to
grow larger and thus become predators.  Shrimp stocks might then be impacted
by increasing the incidence of finfish predation.  Although the interaction of
shrimp and finfish predators in a Gulf of Mexico estuary has been described in
detail, limited information is available regarding shrimp predation in
offshore waters, and its effect on shrimp stocks.  Development of an ecosystem
based model is desirable to guide research and management.  However, it is
important to remember that predictive results of such models are based on
assumptions and the quality information available.

Three surveys spanning 28 years were examined for changes in species
caught by recreational fishermen from small boats (skiffs) and commercial
passenger fishing vessels (CPFV s) in California s Monterey Bay region.  As
fishing effort increased, the catch of certain nearshore species of rockfish,
Sebastes  spp., declined.  CPFV fishing was conducted farther from port and in
deeper water to compensate for declining abundance while most skiffs remained
in traditional areas close to port.  The trend toward deeper water CPFV
fishing has been interrupted only temporarily by increased availability of
nearshore species.  Life history characteristics of rockfish including
residential behavior, variable recruitment, and natural longevity contribute
to a vulnerability to localized overfishing for several species.

We compare assemblages of demersal rockfishes (Scorpaenidae) associated
with two areas of the continental slope off northern Vancouver Island, British
Columbia, Canada.  Twenty and 21 sets of sunken gill nets were completed on
trawlable and untrawlable areas, respectively.  The species assemblages on the
two areas were markedly different, as demonstrated by their diversity,
evenness, and percent similarity and by cluster analysis.  On the trawlable
area, the catch was numerically dominated by Pacific ocean perch, Sebastes
alutus, (37.6%), splitnose rockfish, S. diploproa  (23.5%), greenstriped
rockfish, S. elongatus , (12.7%), and bocaccio, S. Paucispinis , (7.3%).  This
contrasted with the untrawlable area, where the catch was numerically
dominated by sharpchin rockfish, S. zacentrus , (70.8%), and redbanded
rockfish, S. Babcocki , made up half (14.5%) the remaining catch.  We found no
evidence to support the claim by some fishermen that exploited rockfishes on
trawlable areas, especially Pacific ocean perch, are maintained and
replenished by immigration from hard bottom areas, However, rockfish stocks on
hard bottom areas may be subject to increased exploitation as fishing
techniques improve.

spring (April-June) to the subsequent annual (July-June) offshore harvest. 
Predictions since 1981 when a closure of the Exclusive Economic Zone off Texas
(Texas Closure) was implemented to compliment the closure of the Texas
territorial Sea during June through mid-July have underestimated the actual
reported landings.  A revised model that incorporates the effect of the Texas
Closure on yield should improve the reliability and precision of forecasted
yields.  The relationship between yield and juvenile shrimp abundance changed438significantly after the Texas Closure was implemented; the slope of the
relationship almost doubled from the pre-Closure years to the Closure years.

Fish Consumption to Sport Fishermen.""  Fisheries , 13(1):25-26.
Retention and consumption of fish by sport fishermen are generally
reported in the scientific literature to be less important than the
recreational experience.  On this basis, the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Commission prohibited for 120 days the retention of red drum ( Sciaenops
ocellatus ) and spotted seatrout ( Cynoscion  nebulosus ) in a small bay after a
massive coast wide fish kill in 1984.  Simultaneously, the bag, possession,
and size limits for these species were made more restrictive in all other
Texas bays on the gulf of Mexico.  An attempt to adopt the rule prohibiting
retention on a permanent basis was adamantly opposed by fishermen for the
affected bay.  This response was unexpected.  Either the generalization that
keeping fish is not very important is incorrect or the fishermen's reaction is
a localized phenomenon and within the expected variation of the published
generalizations.  This study examines the five possible explanations for the
generalization being incorrect.  Inadequacies in data gathering and analysis
appear to be the most likely explanation.  The experience in Texas indicates
that retention of fish can be of paramount importance to fishermen.  Ditton
and Fedler (1989) response negatively to these conclusions.439Matthews, Geoffrey A. (1982).  ""Relative Abundance and Size
Distributions of Commercially Important Shrimp During the 1981
Texas Closure.""  Maine Fisheries Review , 44(9-10):5-15.
Relative abundances of commercial shrimp, Penaeus  spp., and lengths of
brown shrimp, Penaeus  aztecus , are determined for Texas shelf waters during
the 1981 Texas closure, 22 May-15 July.  A total of 274 samples were collected
in water where bottom depths ranged from 4 to 45 fathoms in four statistical
subareas covering the Texas Gulf coast.  Greatest abundances of Penaeus  were
found between 10 and 20 fathoms in each subarea.  Shrimp were more abundant in
the southern subareas (20 and 21) than in the northern ones (18 and 19). 
Relative abundances during the 1981 closure were usually greater than those
calculated from the 1961-65 Bureau of Commercial Fisheries' and the 1975-80
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's historical shrimp collections for
similar months.  Mean total lengths of brown shrimp in waters where bottom
depths were from 4 to 10 fathoms were close to 100 mm, those in 11-20 fathoms
were close to 115 mm, and those in 21-30 fathoms were close to 130 mm.  When
mean total lengths of brown shrimp were compared among the three data sets,
means of the 1981 closure surpassed those of the two historical data sets
where bottom depths were from 4 to 10 fathoms during June.  Closure mean
lengths between 11 and 20 fathoms were less than those from Bureau of
Commercial Fisheries data and were greater than those from Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department data.  Closure mean lengths in 21-30 fathoms were smaller
than those from both agencies' data.

Marine Resource Economics , 11(3):173-179.
The aim of fisheries management is to avoid over investment in fleet
capacity and over exploitation of economically exploitable fish stocks.  In
this paper, a model is developed where a (big) share of rents created by
control accrues to boat owners while costs are covered by the general public,
which also gets a (small) share of the rent.  The distribution of rents is
governed by administrative rule which opens the possibility of profitable rent
seeking.  Cost of control is assumed to increase as rent per boat increases. 
Control outlays are assumed to be determined so as to maximize gains to the
general public.  It is shown that the optimal size of the fishing fleet
exceeds the size that maximizes fishery rent.  It is also shown that the
higher the share that accrues to the general pubic, the closer the optimal
fleet size is to the rent maximizing fleet size.
Matthiasson, Thorolfur (1997).   Consequences of Local Government Involvement
in the Icelandic ITQ Market.   Marine Resource Economics , 12(2):107-126.
This paper gives an account of the development of fishery regulation and
management in Iceland, including the development of cod stocks, and the
fishing fleet in Iceland since 1945.  There was considerable experimentation440with fishery management systems in Iceland beginning in 1975.  Many economists
and others predicted that the fishing fleet would be reduced as a result of
the new regimes, but this has not happened to the extent anticipated.  Local
governments have traditionally had a stake in the Icelandic fisheries.  The
motives of local municipalities might conflict with the motives pursued by the
fishery managers.  A theoretical model is developed to understand the
consequences of local politicians  involvement in the quota market. 
Furthermore, it is indicated that the degree of ease with which the less
effective fishing firms find ways to circumvent the profitability consequences
of the management regime depends on the initial allocation of fishing rights.

Supply.""  Journal of Environmental Economics and Management ,
15:71-86.
A dynamic behavioral model of timber supply is developed.  The diverse
motivation of forest owners is recognized and the implications for optimal
harvest patterns is explored.  This model is particularly relevant for the
non-industrial private forest (NIPF) sector, and has possible uses for public
forest management.  Properties of the optimal NIPF timber supply curve are
established, and the effects of various taxes are examined.  To explore a more
structured model, simulations are conducted based upon data from a typical
redwood region.  The projections provide indicative results for tax and other
timber land policies.  These results are seen to depend crucially on the forms
of the landowner's utility function and upon the function relating standing
timber to non-income outputs of the forest.  Directions for needed empirical
research are then indicated.441May, Robert M. (1974).  Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems . 
Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey.
This book surveys a variety of theoretical models bearing on aspects of
population stability in biological communities of interacting species.  Some
of the broader themes are the relation between stability and complexity in
general multispecies models; the relation between stability in randomly 
fluctuating environments as opposed to deterministic ones; and the way
environmental fluctuations are liable to put a limit to niche overlap, a limit
to similarity, among competing species in the real world.  Minor themes
include the way nonlinearities can produce stable limit cycle oscillations in
real ecosystems; the role played by time-delays in feedback mechanisms, and
the way that addition of extra trophic levels can stabilize them; the relation
between stability within one trophic level and total web stability; and why
strong predator-prey links may be more common in nature than strong symbiotic
links.  The survey is neither impersonal nor encyclopedic, but rather is an
idiosyncratic reflection of the authors own interests.

arise in the management of fish and whale populations.  Some of the topics are
chosen for their intrinsic mathematical interest and have little direct
relation to real management problems, but most of the work does indeed relate
directly to management questions such as the catch quotas for baleen and sperm
whales.  The basic mathematical model used by the International Whaling

introduced and discussed.  The article concludes with a discussion of the
problems posed by multispecies fisheries, especially those where more than one
trophic level is subject to harvesting.  Such problems ultimately blend

With the overexploitation of many conventional fish stocks, and growing
interest in harvesting new kinds of food from the sea, there is increasing
need for managers of fisheries to take account of interactions among species. 
In particular, as Antarctic krill-fishing industries grow, there is a need to
agree upon sound principles for managing the Southern Ocean ecosystem.  Using
simple models, we discuss the way multispecies food webs respond to the
harvesting of species at different trophic levels.  These biological and
economic insights are applied to a discussion of fisheries in the Southern
Ocean and the North Sea and to enunciate some general principles for442harvesting in multispecies systems.

extending through 1979.  This empirical research was designed to answer the
questions raised by critics of bonus bid leasing: Are the results the outcome
of competitive market process?  Did the government get fair value for its
lease rights?

Because a given management strategy has proved successful in a single
method fishery, it should not be assumed that it is appropriate for a multi-
purpose fishery, that is much more complex.  For a multi-purpose fishery to be
managed to its best advantage its special characteristics must be recognized
and a scheme developed that makes due allowance for the strengths and
weaknesses of these characteristics.

Limited entry was first introduced into the rock lobster and prawn
fisheries in 1963.  Both fisheries have been characterized by rapidly rising
prices for species caught.  Although some sectors of the rock lobster fishery443have remained moderately profitable, excessive reinvestment in boats and
equipment has greatly reduced potential profitability.  No trend towards
company ownership of boats has been evident in this fishery.  The prawn
fishery was initially developed with a high degree of company ownership and
the proportion of company ownership has increased.  Overcapitalization has not
occurred to any great extent in this fishery and profitability has remained
high.

This paper identifies theoretical flaws in past attempts to estimate the
demand for characteristics of goods and recommends new procedures that
overcome these flaws.  First, one can estimate the demand for characteristics
only by examining the outcomes of several independent markets.  Second, if
characteristic prices are nonlinear, the quantity demanded by a consumer
hinges upon the entire price schedule not just the price of the marginal unit
purchased.
Mendelsohn, Robert (1984).  ""Estimating the Structural Equations of
Implicit Markets and Household Production Functions.""  Review of
Economics and Statistics , 66:673-677.
Whenever marginal prices are nonconstant, as in most hedonic and
household production function markets, ordinary least squares estimates of the
price elasticities of structural equations will be biased.  A two-stage least
squares estimation procedure is developed and applied to estimate hedonic (and
potentially household production function) demand functions when price
gradients are nonlinear.

separability does not occur, bounds can be put on the derivative s of an
optimal policy function which can greatly increase computational efficiency.

Recruitment Problem of the Spiny Lobster.""  Fisheries , 5(4):42-46.
With any renewable natural resource, if various parameters such as
mortality, fecundity, and recruitment are known, resource managers can project
harvest rates so as to sustain reasonable yields.  Assessment of these
parameters is sometimes difficult because of peculiarities in the life cycle
or behavior of the resource species.  In many cases the most difficult
parameter to determine is identification of the management unit.  This is
particularly acute in the case of spiny lobster because of their long lived
pelagic, planktonic stage.  However, because of their worldwide economic
importance, considerable effort has gone into research on their life cycle.

The author describes the French fishing fleet replacement policy from
1945 to 1983 and ascertains from it the objectives and constraints of public
policy.  While the theoretical and practical negative effects of open access
fisheries were well assessed, the French experience provides an example of the
difficulties of carrying out a policy limiting access to fisheries.  Domestic
conflicts of interest and open competition with foreign countries failed to
limit the overall fishing capacity of the French fleet.  They have also led
the government to focus on short term distributional issues rather than on
long term efficiency.  It is the author's opinion that similar case studies
could be useful for understanding the evolution of the fishing sector as well
as for putting into perspective the results of the theoretical literature on
open access fisheries.

the consumption of major species of shellfish at home and away from home. 
Findings of the study indicate marked regional preferences for individual
shellfish items.  The study also indicated an association between high income
households and shellfish consumption with oysters a single notable exception. 
Age of consumer has an apparent bearing on shellfish consumption as it was
found that older consumers are the more disposed toward consumption of these
products.  It also appears that half or more of the crabs and lobsters are
consumed in meals outside the home, but the majority consumed of other
products was at home.

This article examines the legal implications of ITQs with regard to
antitrust law.  It begins by identifying the benefits of the ITQ approach and
considering the potential anticompetitive effects of an ITQ system.  It then
discusses the legal requirements for finding of monopoly, illegal price
restraints, and other impermissible restraints on competition.  The article
concludes that ITQ systems can be designed to avert the possibility of
excessive accumulation of shares in the hands of a few, and that such ITQ
systems are unlikely to have effects that will result in antitrust violations.

of Illegal Activity.""  Journal of Environmental Economics and
Management , 13:363-381.
A simple fishery model is developed with legal and illegal markets for
fish, the latter market being combated by enforcement efforts put forth by a
social regulator.  In response to enforcement, violators undertake avoidance
activities to escape detection.  The possible impacts of illegal activity on
optimal fishery management are then explored, and some policy implications are
suggested.  Concurrently, optimal regulation is calculated when: (a) only
legal surplus is maximized versus (b) when both legal and illegal surplus is
maximized.  The rationale for these two regimes and their divergence in
optimal management policies is outlined.

This report presents results from a research project to identify
recreational uses of artificial reefs by private boat owners in Dade County,
Florida and to evaluate the merits of alternative methods to measure the
economic benefits of artificial reef development.  Results from a mail survey
of registered boat owners in 1985 showed that approximately 29 percent of
respondents who fished during the survey period used at least one of the
artificial reefs in Dade County.  Catch rates at artificial reef sites were
generally higher than at nonreef sites.  Approximately 13 percent of
respondents who participated in sport diving during the survey period used the
artificial reefs.  The percent of divers who spearfished at artificial reefs
was about the same as at nonreef sites.  Results from an experiment using
three different contingent valuation formats indicated that both current users
and nonusers had a positive willingness to pay for new artificial reef
development; the valuation format had a significant influence on the mean
valuation.  Several different variations on the basic travel cost method were
also used to assess the economic benefits of a new artificial reef; these
modeling alternatives also yielded different estimates of users' economic
benefits.  Extensions of the sample benefit estimation methods to the
population of Dade county private boaters provide a range of estimated
economic present values for new and existing artificial reefs in Dade County. 
Recommendations for future research on modeling artificial reef participation
and on economic benefit estimation are provided.

There is a growing public interest in the development of artificial
habitats to enhance and diversify coastal marine resources for recreational
and commercial uses.  In this paper, a hierarchical discrete choice model of
recreational demand for artificial habitat is presented using a nested
multinomial logit analysis of artificial and natural habitat site choice by
sport anglers.  The model can be used to evaluate the effects of site
characteristics and socioeconomic attributes of individual sport anglers on
the share allocation of marine fishing trips and to estimate the economic
benefits of new artificial habitat.  An empirical application using survey
data from sport anglers in southeast Florida is reported.  The model
parameters are used to estimate the expected use benefits and distributional
implications of alternative new artificial habitat sites.  Extensions and
limitations of the model for artificial habitat planning are considered.

The growing popularity of marine recreational fishing has created
considerable interest in artificial marine habitat development to maintain and
enhance coastal fishery stocks.  This paper provides a comparative evaluation
of travel cost methods to estimate recreational use benefits for new habitat
site planning.  Theoretical concerns about price and quality effects of
substitute sites, corner solutions in site choice, and econometric estimation
are considered.  Results from a case study indicated that benefit estimates
are influenced by the way these concerns are addressed but relatively simple
single site models can provide defensible estimates.  Practical limitations on
data collection and model estimation are also considered.

Regulation of marine recreational fishing has been achieved through bag
restrictions that influence the composition of kept and released catch.  Prior
economic research on marine recreational fishing has focused on total daily
catch with no recognition of the composition.  In this paper a formal model of
recreational demand for the composition of species catch is presented. 
Empirical analysis using data on king mackerel anglers from the 1986 Marine
Recreational Fishing Statistics Survey for the Gulf of Mexico shows that
distinct kept and released effects can be identified.  Welfare measures
developed from the empirical results reveal a sizeable difference in effects
of changes in recreational catch when alternative catch rate measures are
used.  Policy evaluations that do not account for catch composition in
recreational demand models may provide incorrect estimates of the economic
effects of catch regulations.

Milon, J.W. (1991).  ""Measuring the Economic Value of Anglers' Kept and
Release Catches.""  North American Journal of Fisheries Management ,
11:185-189.
Economic measures of the value of recreational catch typically have been
based on the aggregate number of fish caught per unit effort.  Fishery
management councils, however, regulate recreational catch through bag limits
and size restrictions that influence the composition of kept and released fish
in the catch, not just the number of fish caught.  Statistical tests for
pooled site travel cost demand models for anglers of king mackerel
(Scomberomorus  cavalia ) in the Gulf of Mexico region showed that indicators of
kept and released catches outperformed an aggregate indicator.  Accounting for
the composition of catch had a significant effect on economic measures of the
gains and losses from catch regulations and suggested that aggregate
indicators may give misleading estimates of the change in economic value due
to regulations.  Economic studies of the value of recreational catch in other
fisheries should give more consideration to the effects of regulations on the
composition of kept and released catches and to the social factors that
influence the keep or release decision.451To test the results of this methodological approach, a data set should
be created based on a theoretical model of recreational fisherman behavior
when exploiting a common property resource.  Impose management regulations
such as size and bag limits for a fishing trip.  Estimate the model and
compare the estimated parameters to the known or true parameters for
management implications (consumer surplus).  Modify the model with a catch and
keep constraint, if known and estimated parameters differ and compare to the
Milon elasticity results that seem counter intuitive on page 187.

for the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, Tampa, FL.
Prepared by Food and Resource Economics Department, University of
Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-0240, March.
Using 1990 and 1991 MRFSS data, this study estimated pooled site travel
cost demand models for anglers targeting king mackerel within the range of the
Gulf group king mackerel stock.  Econometric results from the models indicated
that there was no statistical support for a positive relationship between king
mackerel catch rates and demand.  Alternative specifications of a pooled site
travel cost demand model yielded inconsistent and mostly statically
insignificant results for the catch rate variables.  Other variables in the
models performed as expected and were consistent with prior pooled site demand
model results.  Because king mackerel catch rates were not statistically
significant determinants of recreational demand, it was not possible to
compute net economic values (consumers' surplus) from the pooled site demand
models.  The econometric results raise serious concerns about the usefulness
of travel cost demand models to estimate net economic values for recreational
catch given the existing structure of the MRFSS.  The intercept survey does
not provide sufficient information to estimate changes in anglers' probability
of targeting different species. More complete data and further research will
be needed to provide fishery managers with reliable, defensible measures of
the net economic value of king mackerel to recreational anglers.

Little further reflection is necessary to recognize that consumer
surplus and economic rent are both measures of the change in the individual's
welfare when the set of prices facing him are changed or the constraints
imposed upon him are altered.  Any distinction between them is one of
convenience only; consumer surpluses have reference to demand prices, economic
rent to supply prices.  Furthermore, no consideration of logic precludes our
measuring the individual's gain - in terms of compensated valuation or
equivalent valuation - from, say, a simultaneous fall in price of a good
bought and a rise in the price of a service provided.

fish stock is presented to examine the effect of such a conservation motive on
the steady state stock level and to analyze how this stock level is affected
by the division of the harvest.  It is demonstrated that a conservation motive
for one or both countries serves to increase the stock level and that this
level is dependent on the harvest share of the country with motive.  A brief455application to the Canada-European Union turbot and Canada-United states
salmon disputes suggests consistency between the principles of the model and

This paper examines fisheries management problems on the Grand Banks
that were due to divided jurisdiction between Canada s 200 mile Fisheries Zone
and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization s (NAFO) area outside this
zone, which brought to the fore the predicaments associated with straddling
stocks.  These were epitomized by the northern cod fishery.  Because Canadian
scientists overestimated the stocks, northern cod became the basis of a growth
industry for Canada and for considerable fishing activity in the NAFO zone by
vessels from NAFO member and non-member countries during the 1980s.  From 1985
onwards, straddling stocks became a contentious issue between Canada and NAFO
with respect to management measures and their enforcement.  This issue became
particularly acute towards the end of the 1980s when the overestimation of the
northern cod stock became apparent, leading to a reduction in the TACs for
this species and to Canada s closure of this fishery in 1992.  This had severe
economic implications for Canada s Atlantic Coast fishing industry but
resulted in the international acceptance of a new UN Convention for Straddling
Stocks and Highly Migratory Species in 1995.

Quota Management System.   In Karyn L. Gimbel (ed.) Limiting Access to
Marine Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on Conservation , Center for Marine
Conservation and the World Wildlife Fund, Washington, D.C.
New Zealand s quota management system (QMS) is designed to limit access
to fisheries through the establishment of private property rights in the form
of ITQs and also to conserve fish stocks through biologically determined TACs
that are set for each fishery within defined Quota Management Areas.  By
limiting access to fisheries, the QMS attempts to address the problem of open
access to common property fishery resources, which have traditionally led to a
destructive race for fish.
The QMS system has a number of shortcomings.  The system focuses
primarily on single species management and largely fails to address broader457ecosystem considerations.  Political pressure has led to the setting of TACs
at levels beyond maximum sustainable yield.  Bycatch and under reporting
continue to be major problems in the fisheries, as the system is difficult to
enforce and monitor.  The creation of private property rights has proven
effective in expanding the New Zealand fish trade into international markets,
but many species remain overfished.  In addition, the system requires that the
government compensate quota holders when a decision to lower TAC levels is
made.
While the New Zealand QMS is attractive in theory, in practice it has a
number of drawbacks, and is not a panacea for long term conservation of
fisheries.  Others intending to embark along similar lines to New Zealand s
fisheries management system would be well advised to critically examine its
present deficiencies.

The shrimp industry in the Gulf of Mexico is dominated by owner operated

earning a profit.  The lifestyle is one not faced by the investor choosing not
to operate his shrimp boat.  Absentee owners generally experience higher
repair and maintenance costs, higher insurance costs and lower shrimp catches. 
Understanding the situation faced by an absentee owner compared to the
experienced owner operator will be helpful in making your investment
decisions.  Also, there are already a large number of shrimpers competing with
expensive boats for a fully utilized supply of shrimp.  Thus, the skills and
number of your competitors in shrimping must be considered before you invest
in the business.

Because species survival is not certain, the decision to  save  a
species is not an all-or-nothing choice but rather a marginal one.  The
appropriate unit for both benefit and cost functions is the likelihood of
survival and the appropriate question is how certain we want to be of species
survival.  The intensity of the species preservation debate is also fired by
strong equity concerns.  We illustrate these points for the case of the
northern spotted owl by constructing a marginal cost curve for its survival
and by disaggregating welfare loss by region and by market level.

Activities: A Characteristics Approach.""  Journal of Environmental
Economics and Management , 8:345-371.
A model of constrained utility maximizing behavior is developed to
explain how a representative individual allocates his ski days among
alternative sites.  The physical characteristics of the ski areas and the
individual's skiing ability are explicit arguments in the utility function;
the budget allocation is given along with the parametric costs to ski
(including travel costs, entrance fees, equipment costs, and the opportunity
cost of his time).  Shares (a site's share being the proportion of ski days
that the individual spends at that site) are derived and assumed multinomially
distributed, a stochastic specification that maintains the inherent properties
of the shares.  Maximum likelihood estimation confirms the basic hypothesis
that costs, ability, and characteristics all are important determinants of the
sites' shares.  The model explains a large proportion of the skier's
allocation of ski days.  A multinomial logit model of skier behavior is also
developed and maximum likelihood estimates of its parameters are obtained. 
Examination of the summary statistics from my model and the logit model
indicates that my model predicts the skier's choice of sites better than the
logit model.
Morey, Edward R. (1984).  ""The Choice of Ski Areas: Estimation of a
Generalized CES Preference Ordering with Characteristics."" The
Review of Economics and Statistics , ??: 584-590.
A generalized CES (GENCES) preference ordering is developed and
estimated.  It incorporates characteristics of both the individual and the
activities.  The GENCES is used to explain the share of ski time an individual
allocates to each ski area as a function of site characteristics, skiing
ability, and costs.  The stochastic specification limited the shares to the 0-
1 simplex.  This specification was found to be more appropriate than the
conventional normality assumption.  The null hypothesis that preferences are
homothetic and additive is rejected.  Characteristics, ability, and costs are
important determinants of demand.  The estimated elasticities provide numerous
insights into skier behavior.

that Admits Interior and Boundary Solutions."" American Journal of

For most recreation demand data sets, different individuals visit
different subsets of the available sites.  Interior solutions (i.e.,459individuals who visit all recreational sites) are not the norm.  Boundary
solutions (i.e., individuals who do not participate, or who visit some, but
not all, of the sites) predominate.  We critique eight demand models in terms
of their ability to accommodate boundary solutions.  Three models are
recommended for consideration when there are multiple sites and the data set
includes a significant number of boundary solutions: a repeated nested-logit
model, a multinomial share model, and a Kuhn-Tucker model.

Expectations.   Review of Economic Studies , 52(169): 295-310.
This study builds on recent research giving the notion of capacity
utilization clearer economic foundations.  In this research optimal output Y*
is defined as the minimum point on the firm s short run average total cost
curve, and capacity utilization is then computed as CU = Y/Y*, where Y is
actual output.  Here I extend these concepts to include adjustment costs due
to changes in the stock of capital, and nonstatic expectations of future
output demand and input prices.  The more general notion of CU is shown to
depend on the shadow values of the firm s quasi-fixed inputs, and is
decomposed to isolate the effects of anticipatory expectations.  An empirical
comparison is then made between traditional indices and alternative economic
CU measures, using annual U.S. manufacturing data 1954 - 1980.  The calculated
indices exhibit plausible patterns, which can be interpreted as the effects of
nonstatic expectations and adjustment costs.

which the growth rate will be less than the interest rate.

In the literature on renewable resources, the commons problem is held to
be the crucial factor explaining experienced mismanagement.  In this report an
economic experiment demonstrates that serious mismanagement can occur even
when property rights are assigned.  Mismanagement is measured both in terms of
over investment and over utilization.  The most likely explanation is a
misperception of time lags, also found in studies of other dynamic systems. 
For policy making this finding adds the dimension of learning to the previous
dimension of cooperation and conflict resolution.

is combined with Nash's theory of two-person cooperative games.  Conflicts in

and cannot make side or transfer payments to one another.  It is concluded
that side payments greatly ease the resolution of resource management

and New Tools.   In Solving Bycatch, Considerations for Today and
Tomorrow , Alaskan Sea Grant College Program Report No. 96-03, University
of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska, 322 pp.
Bycatch considerations have become critical constraints on the
prosecution and development of marine fisheries in the nation and the world. 
Unless species and size selectivity of fishing techniques are improved, tough
new rules will place additional requirements on existing fisheries or
fisheries may be closed all together.  In these circumstances, the industry
will likely be unable to develop fisheries for the nation s few remaining
underutilized resources.  This workshop has two important objectives: (1)
review recent developments in bycatch reduction, and (2) promote dialogue on
research and policy goals for the future.
Since the first National Industry Buycatch Workshop, held in Newport
Oregon, there has been considerable gear based research, supported by
industry, associations, and government partnerships.  Technical standards for
evaluating bycatch reduction have been developed and applied in some
situations.  Bycatch monitoring programs have been expanded to include a
widening array of fisheries and the nature and extent of the bycatch problem
subjected to quantitative evaluation.  This information has exonerated some
fisheries, and excoriated others.  Recently , more sophisticated real time
bycatch monitoring systems have been developed, with capabilities for
information dissemination.  However, much remains to be done.  Although often
assumed, specific goals for bycatch management have rarely been articulated. 
Development of goals is a necessary step if we are to measure our success
solving bycatch.  New approaches to information sharing, and personal
accountability to operate  cleanly  are challenges which must be faced.  As
well, the scientific community needs to define  how clean is clean enough? 
and to evaluate the consequences of bycatch reduction alternatives on species
and ecosystems.  Regulatory schemes that encourage innovation and
responsibility through incentives for bycatch reduction and discourage those
who jeopardize personal and collective fishing opportunities through463disincentives, must be implemented.
Murawski, S.A. and J.T. Finn (1986).  ""Optimal Effort Allocation Among
Competing Mixed-Species Fisheries, Subject to Fishing Mortality
Constraints.""  Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. , 43:90-100.
A linear programming (LP) approach to effort allocation among two or
more fisheries (fleets) exploiting several common species/stocks is described
and applied to otter trawl fisheries exploiting demersal fish stocks on
Georges Bank (northeastern United States).  Total instantaneous fishing
mortality on a particular species (i) is computed as the linear summation of
fishing mortalities generated by each fishery (j):
Fi=£qijfi
   i
where f i is the amount of standardized fishing effort exerted in fishery j and
qij is the catchability coefficient for species i taken in fishery j. 
Mortality on species i due to both directed fishing and bycatch can thus be
accounted for in the q ij's.  Optimal allocation of effort among the j
fisheries may be considered a minimization problem (minimize £fi), subject to
the constraints that fishing mortality rates on particular species are
maintained at, above, or below certain predefined levels.  Fishing mortality
goals for individual species can be based on various biological and/or
economic criteria: fishing mortality rates that prevent growth or recruitment
overfishing, or that optimize productivity from predator-prey systems.  Other
constraints in the LP model may be included to modify optimal solutions based
on various economic and social considerations (e.g. protection of certain
fisheries).  Sensitivity analyses indicate the general infeasibility of
maintaining relatively high or low fishing mortality rates on ubiquitously
distributed species, while moderately fishing species with more discrete
distributions, due to bycatch considerations.

There has always been considerable interest in the population dynamics
of the clupeoids, in part because of the size of the fisheries, but also
because their landings tend to fluctuate widely, and because some populations
have collapsed under exploitation.  In some instances the collapse seems to be
relatively permanent.  The six million tons of lost production detailed in
Table 35 may not be the end, as Peruvian anchovy catches fell to four million
tons in 1972, and did not significantly exceed two million tons in 1973.

Many observers believe that commercial shrimp bycatch will be the most
important issue southeastern U.S fishery managers must address during the next
several years.  Although the biological impact of bycatch on finish stocks is
uncertain for many species, there is evidence that it may already be affecting
red snapper, mackerel, and weakfish stocks.  Available management measures to
reduce bycatch include area and season closures and gear modification
requirements.  Recent experiences in the southeast with turtle excluder
devices are instructive for developing policy and implementing management
regimes.  Through a 1990 amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management
Act, Congress established a 3 year program to assess the impact on fishery
resources of incidental harvest by the shrimp trawl fishery.  The Gulf and
South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation is forming a steering
committee to develop a strategic plan and to establish criteria for evaluating
gear for the management of bycatch in the southeast shrimp fishery.  The North
Carolina Marine Fisheries Commission (NCMFC) recently required the Division of
Marine Fisheries to establish the goal of reducing bycatch to the absolute
minimum, and appointed a scrap-fish committee to develop draft recommendations
for affected fisheries.  To achieve an acceptable compromise by the fishery
constituency, good coordination, communication, and citizen participation
processes are required.  The committees offer an important opportunity for
developing bycatch management systems.

starboard nets, onboard modifications of FSDs during testing to correct design
deficiencies, and seasonality of shrimp catches in combination with large
masses of sargassum and jellyfish in trawls during fall sampling.  The
modified Parrish TED was the only FSD that had a significant reduction in the
percent difference in total biomass compared to the control net.

In this study we consider the problem of estimating, for management
purposes, a minimum biomass reference level at which recruitment to a fish
stock is seriously reduced.  We take an empirical, comparative approach to the
problem by examining observations on a wide range of fish stocks.  Eight
methods for estimating spawning stock biomass thresholds for recruitment
overfishing are investigated.  Their behavior is tested using stock and
recruitment data for 72 finfish populations, each with at least 20 years of
data.  We considered three classes of thresholds defined by : (1) the stock
size corresponding to 50% of the maximum predicted average recruitment; (2)
the minimum stock size that would produce a good year class when environmental
conditions are favorable; and (3) the stock size corresponding to 20% of
various estimates of virgin stock size.  The estimators of the first type are
generally preferable because they are easily understood, relatively robust if
only data at low stock sizes are available, and almost always result in higher
levels of recruitment above the threshold.

Recreational fishing for snappers and groupers is conducted mainly from
boats: party, charter, and private boats.  Available statistics for snappers
and groupers caught in the Gulf of Mexico indicate that catches by
recreational anglers are substantially higher than those by commercial
fishermen.  In 1970, the number of recreational anglers fishing in the Gulf of
Mexico for snappers was estimated at 437,000 and for groupers at 301,000.  The
average annual expenditure by salt water anglers was estimated at $178.  Thus,
the 437,000 anglers spent about $77.8 million and the 301,000 anglers spent
about $53.6 million in pursuit of their avocation.  These numbers probably are
not additive, since the grouper anglers also may have fished for snappers.  In
1973, the number of private boats fishing in the Gulf of Mexico was estimated
at 348,595; the number of party boats and charter boats was estimated at 437. 
The annual gross revenue for these 437 commercial sport boats was estimated at
$26.9 million.  Comparable data for the private boats were not available.

Under the authority of an amendment to the Fishery Management Plan for
Coastal Migratory Pelagics resources, that among other requirements declared
mandatory reporting, a survey of charterboats in the southeast was conducted. 
Only the reporting of catches of coastal pelagics was mandatory.  However, six
noncoastal pelagic fishes were added to the list of fishes in the charterboat
logbooks.  The six were red snapper, ( Lutjanus  campechanus ), vermilion snapper
(Rhomboplites  aurorubens ), yellowtail snapper ( Ocyurus  chrysurus ), gag
(Mycteroperca  microlepis ), black sea bass ( Centropristis  striata ), and red
drum (Sciaenops  ocellatus ).  This report summarizes the catch and effort for
these six as reported by responding charterboat captains in 1986.

Demographic Profile of Participants in Two Gulf of Mexico Inshore
Shrimp Fisheries and Their Response to the Texas Closure.""  Marine
Fisheries Review ,53(1):10-18.
A social study of the shrimp fisheries of Galveston Bay, Texas, and
Calcasieu Lake, La., was made during the summer of 1987 to examine the impacts
of the seasonal closure of the Federal waters off Texas and to understand the
infrastructure and demographic processes of these two diverse fisheries. 
Survey instruments were administered to 159 shrimp boat captains; 89 from
Galveston Bay and 70 from Calcasieu Lake.  Shrimp-house owners were
interviewed in each region as well.
The results suggest that the inshore fisheries are distinct from the
offshore fisheries.  The infrastructure of the two inshore fisheries examined
differ in that the market distribution of shrimp from Galveston Bay was more
diffuse than from Calcasieu Lake.  Much more of the shrimp harvested from
Galveston Bay was channelled into the surrounding community than from
Calcasieu Lake.
The distribution of age, years as a commercial fisherman, and family
involvement in fishing suggest that participation in Calcasieu Lake's and473Galveston Bay's inshore fisheries have expanded concurrent with declining
economies.  While overall the Texas closure had little impact on either of the
inshore fisheries, the Galveston Bay shrimpers experienced more of a direct
impact on their livelihood than Calcasieu Lake shrimpers.

In January, 1990, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council
requested that the Southeast Fisheries Center investigate the feasibility of
improving the economic returns from the brown shrimp fishery through
cooperative management measures with Louisiana and other Gulf coast states. 
During the past year, a simulation model was developed at the Galveston
Laboratory to study the impact of closure options on the brown shrimp fishery. 
The basic premise of the model was to prohibit fishing on emigrating juvenile
brown shrimp and allow the population to increase to a larger and more
valuable average size.  The complete analysis involved four phases: 1)
construction of the biological model to simulate yields in numbers of shrimp
and pounds; 2) calculation of revenues from simulated landings and regional
price structure; 3) determination of fishing costs based on published cost
information and data regarding the size of the fishery (i.e., number and type
of fishing vessels); and 4) simulation of four separate time period closure
options in the brown shrimp fishery for different regional areas within the
Gulf of Mexico.

The closure options were evaluated for Texas only (current condition) and for
the entire U.S. Gulf of Mexico (proposed condition).  The model provided an
accurate biological simulation of the brown shrimp fishery in the Gulf of
Mexico.  Each of the evaluated closures gave positive net profits to the
fishery as a whole.  However, these benefits were mainly for larger vessels
(greater than 50 feet in length).  None of the proposed closures increased the
profits for boats (undocumented vessels of unknown lengths), and only some
closures increased the profits for smaller vessels (Less than 50 feet in
length).

The shrimp industry in the Gulf and south Atlantic is suffering severe
economic hardship.  Vessel owners are caught in a unprecedented cost-price
squeeze and the average vessel is not even covering variable costs at present. 
Since September 1973, Gulf shrimp prices have fallen an average of 41 percent,
while variable costs have risen substantially.  Nonetheless, most vessels
continue to fish for reasons that include the fisherman's eternal hope for the
""big catch.""  If conditions do not change, many vessel operators will probably
be forced out of the fishery by January 1975.  Shrimp processors, principally475breaders, have suffered losses totaling millions of dollars and hundreds of
employees of these firms have lost their jobs.  The total effect on the
associated local economies is not known, but many counties have applied or
asked for disaster assistance in the form of food stamps, low cost loans or
other temporary economic relief.  Further up the marketing chain the losses
are not quite as severe, principally because the restaurants and retailers do
not depend so heavily on shrimp as their principal livelihood.  Still, loses
have been suffered at all marketing levels.

These overall approaches are not mutually exclusive and deserve further
discussion.  In particular, a tax or fee system may support the other
approaches.  There is probably on singe ""best"" approach.  Instead, a case-by-
case decision is necessary.  The IFQ, for example, has many theoretical476advantages, especially compared to a limit on input factors, but implicitly
assumes that total yield from the fishery can be reasonably predicted (not
true) and that an individual quota can be enforced.  Although areal leases can
be used for fugitive resources, this approach might not gain public acceptance
because of possible monopolistic aspects (wrong).  Taxes or fees return the
greatest revenues to the general public and do not create a property or access
right.  All approaches, except the limit on input factors, promote efficiency
but might be more expensive to enforce.  Limits on inputs factors might be
most acceptable to fishermen and easiest to enforce but have proven to be
inflexible and ineffective for managing common property resource.

Except under certain conditions where trawling periods are limited by
fishing conditions to about 45 minutes bottom time, synchronized tow times may
not be a practical management option for the conservation of sea turtles in
offshore shrimp fisheries of the southeast region.  Furthermore, there seems
to be little room for reasonable compromise.  Jeopardy of sea turtles
increases rapidly at bottom tow times above 45 minutes, while on the other
hand, production capabilities of the shrimp fisheries decrease rapidly at
bottom tow times less than about 105 minutes.  The extremes of the situation
seem too great to reasonably expect a practical solution predicated on
enforceable maximum tow times.

council.  This information includes the number of commercial and charterboat
permits over time, the gag limits that apply in the EEZ and in the states, the
allocation formulas used to compute quotas from specified levels of TAC, the
ABC ranges for the 1991/92 fishing year, and the quotas that result from the
various levels of TAC.  The economic implications for commercial fishermen,
recreational anglers and charterboat operations are estimated in terms of
exvessel values, changes in recreational value (consumer surplus), changes in
charterboat profits and changes in charterboat revenues.  Also, month of
closure predictions are made for the mackerel group/user combinations.

shrimp trawls.  This proposed rule would amend those requirements currently
contained in the 1987 sea turtle conservation regulations (52 FR  24244, June

Commerce, Silver Spring, Maryland, April, 7 pp.
This report provides two measures of the potential magnitude of economic
and social benefits that may be realized by rebuilding U.S. fisheries.  First,
many U.S. fishery resources are over utilized and fishing industries over
capitalized.  The report estimates the potential net benefits resulting from
the recovery of depleted stocks and the full and efficient utilization of all
fishery resources.  These net benefits from the foundation for economic
investment and growth of the industry.  Second, public officials and resource
managers are also interested in the immediate and long term effects of their
decisions on the overall economic activity, independent of economic
efficiency.  Therefore, the report also estimates the cumulative direct,
indirect, and induced effects of increased harvesting on the Nation s Gross
National Product and on employment.

The National Marine Fisheries Service, Office of International Affairs
began monitoring world shrimp culture developments in 1983 as part of an
effort to both assess the potential economic impact on the important u.S.
commercial trawl fishery and to provide basic information to U.S. companies
and academic researchers.  The shrimp trawl fishery is one of the most
important U.S. commercial fisheries.  Shrimp landings exceeded $0.5 billion in
1991 and play a key role especially in many Gulf of Mexico coastal
communities.  The massive increases in cultured shrimp harvests during the
1980's have had a major impact on world shrimp markets.  The increases have
played a major role in the decline of real (inflation adjusted) prices for
shrimp.  This book and previous assessments are an effort to provide the
fishing community sufficient information to understand past trends and make
economic projections based on likely future prospects for cultured harvests.

Clarify operation of vessels with a Federal commercial permit, establish a
fishing year, consolidate the regulations for drift gillnets, require dealers
to  obtain a permit to purchase sharks, require dealer reports, establish
recreational bag limits, establish quotas for commercial landings, and provide
for commercial fishery closures when quotas are reached.  The intended effect
of this rule is to prevent overfishing of shark resources, encourage
consistent Federal and state management of shark stocks, increase the benefits
from shark resources to the nation while preventing waste, and standardize
data reporting requirements among different fisheries to avoid confusion among
fishermen with multiple permits.483National Marine Fisheries Service (1994).  ""Habitat Protection

The NMFS and others have determined that a number of finfish resources
in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic are depleted for several reasons,
including the application of too much fishing effort by commercial and
recreational fishermen and the incidental bycatch of the shrimp trawl fleet. 
The ensuing debate about how best to restore the stocks to desirable levels
involves numerous technological, political, biological, and economic factors. 
Among them are: 1) technological interaction in which shrimp gear
inadvertently harvests finfish; 2) management interaction between the shrimp
and other FMPs governing the harvest of finfish species; 3) competition
between commercial and recreational fishermen and among fishermen with
different gear types within each group; 4) economic trade-offs over time among
various harvesting groups and between different groups of consumers; 5) the
current uncertainty regarding whether or not the commercial management
structure will allow for an ITQ or similar management system; 6) a lack of
current biological information to determine the desirable size of some of the
finfish stocks and future yields; and 7) whether or not effort controls will
be placed on the recreational fishery.  For all these reasons, the interaction
between the shrimp and finfish fisheries of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
constitutes a management and economics problem that is controversial,
challenging, and, as yet unresolved in the case of most southeast finfish
stocks.

finfish stocks and future yields; and 7) whether or not effort controls will
be placed on the recreational fishery.  For all these reasons, the interaction
between the shrimp and finfish fisheries of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
constitutes a management and economics problem that is controversial,
challenging, and, as yet unresolved in the case of most southeast finfish
stocks.

experience, perceptions, preferences, and choices of consumers for seafood
products based on a modified evoked set framework.  Factors such as knowledge
that the products are farm-raised, having previous experience with purchasing
seafood along with the perception that seafood is healthful with good taste
were found to significantly influence the consumer s decision to purchase the
these finfish products.  The results of this study and the techniques used
allow market researchers to objectively quantify the impact of experience,

The Tobit model is a useful tool for estimation of regression models
with truncated or limited dependent variables, but it requires a threshold
which is either a known constant or an observable and independent variable. 
The model presented here extends the Tobit model to the censored case where
the threshold is an unobserved and not necessarily independent random
variable.  Maximum likelihood procedures can be employed for joint estimation
of both the primary regression equation and the parameters of the distribution
of that random threshold.

Capacity utilization (CU) is usually defined as the ratio of actual

curve, (ii) the point of tangency between the LRATC and SRATC curves.  In
practice, however, CU is often measured as the ratio of actual to the maximum
potential output consistent with a given capital stock.  This paper
demonstrates how to estimate the theoretical measures of CU, and examines the
correlation between the three measures of CU, and the McGraw-Hill estimates of
CU, using data from a sample of U.S. privately owned electric utilities for

It has been concluded that the industrial fishing fleet represents the
greatest part of economic waste in fisheries.  The actions required by states
in exercising control over their fleet capacities are severe; the estimates
are for a fleet reduction of between 41 and 47 percent.  Although the 1995 UN
Agreement does not include provisions for reducing fleet capacity, regional
fishery organizations may be able to adjust limit reference points to lower
catch levels to include excess capacity and its effect in undermining
conservation and management measures.  There is an urgent need to improve the
transparency for monitoring fleet size, implementing an international standard
measurement for fishing vessels, establish reporting of high seas catches in
the FAO statistics, and encourage international attention to the special
problem of flags of convenience.

University, Baton Rouge, LA.
The southeast shrimp processing industry has been examined from an
economic perspective.  Results show that while the number of plants decreased
during the 1973-88 period, the production activities, as measured by total
pounds, increased.  Most of this increased activity was due to peeled product. 
Though processing activities in terms of pounds being processed has been
increasing, the deflated value of these processing activities has exhibited no
growth since the mid 1970's due to a sharp decline in the deflated price of
all forms of processed shrimp; i.e., raw headless, peeled, breaded, and
others.

This report provides estimates of the economic aspects of swordfish
longlining particularly as it relates to investment requirements and operating
costs.  These estimates are developed from interviews with vessel owners and
captains who were active in the fishery during the 1979-80 season.  Recent
pressure on the shrimp trawling industry of Texas have caused shrimpers to
consider alternative fishing opportunities.  Among these, swordfish longlining
was of particular interest in early 1980.  The degree of fishing pressure that
swordfish stocks can withstand is not known.  Caution has been advised
regarding rapid expansion of swordfish longlining even though the short run
benefits to shrimpers may be favorable.

This report presents estimates of the cost of operating several
alternative systems for holding and landing finfish caught incidental to497shrimp trawling operations.  Freezer units, brine immersion tanks, and onboard
fish meal plants, an extra crew member, and a mothership concept are the
systems evaluated.  Break-even prices are estimated that would be necessary to
cover operating costs and a 10 percent return on investment.  Additionally,
problems in traditional work patterns, crew incentives, and institutional
arrangements are discussed.  Comparison of estimated break-even prices with
recent market prices indicate that none of the proposed systems are viable
except under very restrictive conditions.  The mothership or tender vessel
concept shows the most economic potential but is plagued with problems of
coordinating a large number of vessels in an industry where independence of
operation is valued highly.  The analytical model presented may be used to
evaluate other systems not considered directly in this study.

A yield per recruit analysis and a simulation model of shrimp fishing
show that an increase in brown shrimp yield was realized from closure of the
Fishery Conservation Zone (FCZ) off Texas during May-July 1981.  Yields were
11.7 million pounds greater (29 percent) than would have been expected with
the FCZ open during May-August 1981.  Some of the increase in yield was made
at the expense of standing stock.  Projections over the fishable lifespan of
the shrimp indicate that yields will be increased 4 million pounds (7 percent)
due to the FCZ closure.

The 1979 management advice remains essentially the same.  The current target
minimum size of 103 mm total length theoretically should produce a 14 to 20%
gain, compared to unregulated conditions, in weight yields from shrimp
recruiting through the closure area during the peak fishing season.  Gains in
dollar value (ex-vessel gross revenue) due to closure would be from 45 to 64%
during the peak season.  However, because of the natural protection already
provided by untrawlable bottoms in some areas where small shrimp are abundant,
these percentage gains probably are overestimates.

the shrimp fishery to reduce bycatch of red snapper are collected in this
document including observations made by biologists aboard commercial shrimp
vessels, research trawl data, and results derived from commercial statistics
on the distribution of shrimp effort and fishing mortality rate.  In general,
if a closure can be reasonably expected to reduce the amount of shrimping
effort in the offshore waters of the Gulf, there is a good chance that the
closure will effect some reduction in red snapper bycatch.  If a closure
simply causes effort to move around in time or space without decreasing the
amount of effort, little bycatch reduction can be expected, and some closures
might turn out to be counter productive.

Fisheries Service, April, 18 pp.
The paper sets 1982-86 as the base year class for future calculations of
F for finfish bycatch levels in the shrimp fishery.  The extended funnel and
the fisheye are two identified effective gear options for bycatch reduction. 
In spite of the recognized need and the importance of forecasting future
effort levels, the authors propose using a constant level of effort based on
the 1982-86 average days fished in all future bycatch estimations for the
shrimp fishery.  Lastly, TED use is unlikely to have reduced red snapper F
below the baseline value.  Also, found in Southeast Fisheries Science Center

A bilateral monopoly exists between an elementary bureau and its
government review group.  This market involves the exchange of some output for
a budget rather than at a per unit price.  In any such bilateral monopoly
condition, output is indeterminate within a range without determining the
conditions affecting the bargaining between the two parties.  My model of500bureaucratic supply determines only the bureau's preferred output based on an
assumption that the bureau acts to maximize its budget.  The government's
preferred output is determined from conventional majority rule models or from
my special model of decisions by a ""high demand"" committee.
Two criticisms of this theory are (1) that budget maximization by
bureaus is not obviously consistent with utility maximizing by bureaucrats and
(2) that the theory does not develop the conditions for an equilibrium output
between the output preferred by the bureau and the output preferred by the
government.  Based on these criticisms, modifications to the theory are
outlined in this paper.

Transferable Quotas.  In Karyn L. Gimbel (ed.) Limiting Access to Marine
Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on Conservation , Center for Marine
Conservation and the World Wildlife Fund, Washington, D.C.
Until recently, the traditional tools of the fishery manager  (minimum
sizes, closed seasons, etc.) were sufficient to ensure the health of our
nation s open access fishery resources.  However, the tremendous growth in
harvesting capacity spurred by the passage of the Magnuson Act has created the
need either to develop some new tools or radically improve the effectiveness
of the existing methods.  This paper will discuss the use of one new tool, the
individual transferable quota (ITQ), and examine the advantages and
disadvantages associated with its use in the context of the seven National
Standards for fishery conservation and management in the Magnuson Act.  Four
major problem areas are considered.  First, the nature of the property right
is considered, with particular attention to the issue of initial allocation. 
Second, the difficulty in establishing the appropriate  management unit is
considered.  Third, the problem of determining TAC with sufficient specificity
for an ITQ system is examined.  Finally, the issues of monitoring and
enforcing the more complex ITQ system are considered.  ITQs while having
potential in some U.S. fisheries are no silver bullet for fishery managers.

Shelf Groundfishery off Nova Scotia, Canada.   In Karyn L. Gimbel (ed.)
Limiting Access to Marine Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on Conservation ,
Center for Marine Conservation and the World Wildlife Fund, Washington,
D.C.
Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) have been used as a method of
implementing total allowable catches (TACs) on Canada s East Coast since the
early 1980's.  In the groundfish fishery, their first use was in 1982 as
nontransferable enterprise allocations (EAs) in regulation of the large
offshore companies.  This was followed by implementation of EAs in the mid-
shore fleet in 1988 and IQs in the <65' mobile fleets off western
Newfoundland, again in 1988.  The most recent implementation of IQs and the
subject of this paper, is in the <65' mobile gear fleet off Nova Scotia, which
targets the lucrative cod, haddock, and pollock stocks resident in the region. 
The Nova Scotia fleet grew dramatically in capacity during the late 1970's to
mid-1980's to a level estimated to be four times that necessary to fish at the
Departmental target of F 0.1.  This precipitated a resource crisis in 1989 and
stimulated a specially struck Task Force to examine the causes and recommend504solutions, one of the main ones being institution of IQs.  An extensive
consultative process with industry ensued to establish the quota allocation
process, bycatch trading rules, appeal procedures, and sanctions for
violators.  In addition, a new user paid catch monitoring system was
established as a central feature of enforcement.  While it is too early to
gauge the success of the IQ approach, it has received support of participants,
but criticism from other sectors, particularly in relation to social
consequences and enforcement problems.  The effects of IQs will have to be
carefully monitored to understand how this regulatory tool impacts the fleets
as well as the communities that depend upon them.

of an Age-Structured Groundfish Resource Exploited by a Multi-Gear
Fishing Fleet.   ICES Mar. Sci. Symp. , 193:264-274.
A bioeconomic model of the Scotian Shelf groundfish fishery involving
otter trawler and longliner fleets was constructed to examine the biological
economic, and regulatory consequences of the interaction of these two fleets. 
Otter trawlers catch younger fish than longliners and the revenue-cost
pictures are very different.  The model allowed examination of the long-term
equilibrium levels and short term transitory paths.  The results of the
simulation indicate that both yield and employment were superior for
longliners.  However, otter trawlers, although experiencing higher operating
costs, could  out compete  longliners owning to higher sustained catch rates
and thus revenue per unit cost.  From a regulatory point of view, it was
determined that, under the assumptions of this study, the fishery could be
managed by regulating only trawler activity.  The longliner fleet could be
left essentially unregulated since it is not economical for it to overfish the
stock.  The results of this study have significant implications for the
management of multispecies, multi-gear fisheries in which differential age
effects of exploitation are present.

lacking.  The physical yield function of the California trawl fishery is
incorporated in an economic model to show the relationship between maximum
sustainable physical yield of the fishery and maximum economic yield. 
Maximizing the economic benefit of the fishery to society would involve a
drastic reduction in resource use at a catch level considerably below the
biological maximum sustainable yield.  Only through marginal cost pricing can
resources be allocated efficiently to the fishery.505Oates, Wallace E. (1983).  ""Economic Incentives for Environmental

using a multiperiod mathematical programming model where prices, fishing
effort, catch, and resource dynamics are treated endogenously.  These results
are then compared with actual effort.  The comparison indicates substantial
excess effort in spring and early summer, especially in the bays and shallow
offshore areas.  The peak fishing season also occurs later in the fall in
optimal harvest pattern than in practice.  The results indicate both producers
and consumers gain from reduced fishing effort because of improved size
composition of the harvest.

Because of the extreme uncertainty in fisheries biology, efforts to
determine a stock recruitment relationship have not been entirely successful. 
In the face of this uncertainty, this paper argues for a change in focus for
fisheries economics from bioeconomic optimization toward goals that are more
modest and more easily achievable.  In particular, a satisficing approach to
management is advocated, whereby efforts are made to reallocate fisheries,
with no attempt to determine the optimum.  To achieve such a solution
efficiently, managers must accurately predict the response of fishermen to
public policy.  This paper reports on a study that develops a discrete choice
model to predict fishermen's supply response.  Fishermen are shown to respond
to economic incentives of expected returns and variability of returns, but
only after these incentives surpass a substantial threshold.

Spill Impacts on Natural Resources: An Economic Risk Analysis."" 
Paper Prepared for the 1989 Oil Spill Conference, San Antonio,

Risk analyses of oil spills are important in the development of OCS
leasing policy as well as other marine policies relating to oil.  This paper
explores the use of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Coastal
and Marine Resources (NRDAM/CME) to provide risk analysis of oil spills
related to OCS oil development.  For the categories of natural resources
included in the NRDAM/CME, the expected value of damages from large oil spills
appears quite small relative to the value of oil developed.  Expected damages
range from $300 thousand to $19.7 million per billion barrels of oil
developed.  Ongoing research by the authors will refine these estimates by
including (1) additional categories of damages, that will increase the damage
estimates, and (2) oil spill cleanup and the effect of OCS production on
reducing imports, that will reduce the estimated net costs of OCS development.

Marketable permits are shown to result in savings of 60 percent.  However,509there is likely to be industry opposition to the permit system because of the
distribution of benefits, despite the fact that the industry benefits in the

Economic assistance in many countries takes two forms: assistance to
harvesting and assistance to processing.  Harvesting assistance is for social
reasons and for the broader objective of alleviating specific obstacles. 
Processing assistance includes short term adjustment measures to alleviate
adverse effects on the industry of cyclical fluctuations.  Few countries in

Operational modifications based on recreational angler activity patterns
can be successfully formulated to increase creel survey efficiency without a
significant loss of information.  This study was conducted to estimate the
amount of Texas marine sport-boat angler interview and retained fish data (bay
and Gulf) that would be missed both coast wide and within each bay system if
surveys were terminated early when no angler interviews were conducted by a
specified time.  Using this method, less than 3 percent of the total
interviews and retained fish would be missed coast wide by terminating surveys
at 1400 hours on weekends and 1600 hours on weekdays throughout the survey
year.  This would result in the early termination of 14 percent of the weekend
surveys and 23 percent of the weekday surveys, thus allowing an annual
redirection of 440 work hours and $6,063 in operating expenses.

System.""  American Journal of Political Science , 22(4):743-771.
The balance of power literature is intermingled with hypotheses relating
the number of actors to stability in the international system.  In addition to
the controversy in the theoretical literature, there is an extensive empirical
literature in which we find support for a wide range of contradictory
hypotheses.  The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the leading hypotheses
based on operationalizations of the key concepts that are consistent with the
balance of power literature, a common data set, a coherent specification of
the contending hypotheses, and the use of appropriate estimation techniques. 
A major factor in this test is that the dependent variable of each model is
not a measure of the amount of war; instead, we estimate the probability of
war through the use of the probit estimation technique.  The results of the
comparative evaluation indicate that the existing hypotheses are not able to
account for the probability of war in the international system.

A possible approach to the management of multispecies multigear fishery
in a developing country was explored.  The small pelagics fishery in central
Philippines was analyzed in three stages.  A dynamic pool model represented
the dynamics of the stocks.  The optimal allocation of catch across competing
fleets was modeled having regard for the pursuit of two conflicting
objectives, maximizing employment and fishing profits.  Alternative management
schemes were then explored.  On the basis of this criteria, the optimal fleet
size was a small fraction of the existing fleet size.  Calculation of
increased target yields through regulation of fishing mortality and
selectivity showed that the increase in optimal fleet size would be moderate
because the current level of exploitation is close to that producing the
maximum yield-er-recruit.  An agenda for exploration of further management
alternatives appropriate to the social and economic policy objectives of a
developing country is discussed.

""Abundance of Spanish Mackerel, Scomberomorus  maculatus , in the
Southeastern United States Based on Charterboat CPUE Data, 1982-

Catch per unit effort (CPUE) data for Spanish mackerel over a broad
geographic area were obtained from charterboats.  In 1982, a survey was
initiated to obtain daily catch and effort data on fishes commonly caught by
charterboats in the southeast United States.  Boat effort and Spanish mackerel
CPUE data obtained from this survey during 1982-85 were analyzed.  The
offshore fishing zone (>10 fathoms) received the highest amount of trolling
and other fishing efforts; the nearshore fishing zone (<=10 fathoms) received
the second highest trolling effort and lowest other fishing effort; the
estuarine fishing zone received the lowest trolling effort and the second
lowest other fishing effort.  CPUE of Spanish mackerel by other fishing was
much lower than trolling for most areas and years.  CPUE was highest in the
estuarine zone when compared with the nearshore and offshore zones.  In the
southeastern United States from North Carolina to Texas, the highest CPUE
occurred in areas within the eastern Gulf of Mexico from Louisiana to
southwest Florida each year.  Seasonally CPUE of Spanish mackerel was high in
the warmer months in Georgia, the Carolinas, and the northern Gulf of Mexico
states and in the colder months in the southeastern areas of Florida. 
Significant differences in CPUE among years were detected only in North
Carolina and Louisiana.

Using the results of two surveys taken five years apart in a number of
Thai fishing villages and employing different methods of analysis, the present
study estimates the degree of mobility among fishing households and identifies
and measures the relative significance of impediments to mobility.  It is516found that fishermen are responsive to economic incentives and do move between
occupations to take advantage of earning differentials.  This mobility,
however, is tempered by noneconomic factors such as age, location, religion,
isolation, and occupational preference.  Labor appears to be quite mobile
between occupations but less so between locations.

Statics of a Competitive Industry with Inframarginal Firms.""  The
American Economic Review , 68(3):474-478.
A simple analytical model of a competitive industry with a rising supply
curve is developed by positing that firms may have diverse endowments of a
fixed factor in inelastic supply.  Thus, in equilibrium, there may be
inframarginal firms earning economic rents that are imputed to the fixed
factor.  When there are inframarginal firms, only the input market measure of
social benefits is accurate.
Paris, Quirino (1988).  ""Long-Run Comparative Statics Under Output and
Land Price Uncertainty.""  American Journal of Agricultural
Economics , 70(1):133-141.
Several authors have noticed that, in the uncertain short run, the
supply function may slope downward and the input demand functions may slope
upward.  These possibilities prevent the setup of unambiguous tests of
rational behavior.  In this article, testable hypotheses for the competitive
firm operating in a price uncertain environment are derived assuming a long
run horizon.  
Some of these hypotheses take the form of Slutsky type relations involving the
relative input demand functions (the ratios of input to output quantities). 
Homogeneity restrictions involving input and output mean prices, in general,
are absent under uncertainty.  Conditions for restoring this homogeneity are
also discussed.  The main result is the rediscovery of the importance of
relative quantities for the analysis of a long run equilibrium.

ageing king and Spanish mackerel.  Information on growth required for
application of the stochastic methods (size and variation of size at age) was
reviewed for king and Spanish mackerel and growth results not reported to date
in the literature summarized and presented.  The methods reviewed here in
addition to the existing database of age and growth data can be used to
classify king and Spanish mackerel catch at length distributions available
from the recreational and commercial fisheries into age densities.

A preliminary assessment of the Atlantic and Gulf greater amberjack
fishery assessment through 1991 was presented in March 1993.  Those results

the ability of the population model used to accurately assess the condition of

Those concerns are readdressed in this report.  In addition catch statistics
and reported landings for the commercial and recreational fisheries,
biostatistical length and weight samples, summary recreational catch per
effort information and bag limit analyses from headboat catches are presented
through 1992.  For comparison purposes, the population model, SLM, applied to
the Atlantic and Gulf greater amberjack fisheries previously by Parrack (1993)
is used to summarize the trends in the greater amberjack population dynamics
from the combined fisheries.

This report presents information that updates reported commercial

Gulf of Mexico red snapper resources since 1979.  These annual age specific
catches and abundance indices, independent from catches, were used to obtain
initial estimates of stock sizes and fishing mortality rates of red snapper
assuming an eastern and a western Gulf of Mexico stock.  The results of these
investigations indicate that red snapper stocks have declined since 1979 as
predicted from VPA investigations.

A preliminary model of the demersal trawl component of the multispecies

two metiers (sub-fisheries) - two otter trawl metiers and three beam trawl
metiers.  The model is the first step in development of a more comprehensive
model of the fishery as a whole.  In the model, the fleet is segmented by
region of origin, boat type and boat size.  The fishing activity of fleet boat
segment is segmented by area (metier) and season fished.  Catches and landings
of ten key species (plus one aggregated category of other species) are
estimated for each fleet segment in each fishing activity, based on the effort
allocation of each fleet segment.  Prices and costs are endogenous in the
model.  The model is developed as an optimization model, with the objective
function being the maximization of total gross margins in the fishery.

Shrimp Prices: A Comparison of Three Different Models.""  Draft
Report, Center for Wetland Resources, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
The size composition of shrimp imports has changed in recent years with
the development of pond raised shrimp.  The impact of these imports on U.S.
shrimp markets is concentrated in the 26 to 40 count size range since the
shrimp are usually raised to these sizes.  So aquaculture has changed the
quantity ratios between sizes of shrimp that would occur if all shrimp were
harvested from wild stocks.  This research was undertaken to understand the
nature of these price fluctuations.  Two different techniques for price
forecasting are discussed in this paper: (1) time series models and (2)
econometric models.

for Small Louisiana Shrimp.""  Marine Fisheries Review , 48(4):65-
70.
Louisiana has long been known for its sometimes controversial harvest of
small shrimp from its inshore waters.  With the trend toward landings of
smaller shrimp from the Gulf, the economics of the small shrimp processing and
marketing industry is of increasing importance.  The production of three
shrimp products, raw head-on, peeled, and canned, was found to be dependent on
small shrimp supply.  Over 20 percent of the shrimp moving through Louisiana's
processing plants was shipped out of the state for further processing.  Most
of these were small, head-on shrimp.  Louisiana is an important supplier of
small shrimp products and small shrimp for processors in other Gulf states.

The symposium was designed to bring together a small number of leading
fishery economists and fishery administrators with experience in the field of
fisheries management from Canada, the U.S., and elsewhere.  Our purpose was to
pool our knowledge about the current state of the art in economic
rationalization of fisheries, to document and analyze the available
experience, and to explore avenues of needed policy research.

This report identifies opportunities for reorganizing the commercial
fisheries to put an end to their chronic instability and poor economic
performance and start them on a healthier course of development, for
preserving and enhancing sportfishing opportunities, and for securing Indians'
traditional access to fish.  These are not just theoretical possibilities;
they are attainable through established technologies and regulatory methods
and at a cost that is modest relative to the benefits.
Pearse, Peter H. (1992).  ""From Open Access to Private Property: Recent
Innovations in Fishing Rights as Instruments of Fisheries Policy."" 
Ocean Development and International Law , 23:71-83.
As pressures on ocean fisheries have grown, pervasive evidence of
overexploited resources and economic distress has revealed fundamental
weaknesses in traditional regulatory policies.  In their search for new
management approaches, fishing nations have recently turned their attention to
the nature of fishing rights, and the trend is clearly toward more well
defined, exclusive property rights.  In a remarkably short time the tradition
of open access to ocean fisheries has waned; rights to most of the world's
fish resources have been appropriated by coastal states, their governments
have excluded everyone from access to the stocks except those who hold
licenses, and increasingly, the rights of license holders are quantitatively
specified.  Experience so far suggests that strengthening the property rights
of fishing enterprises is a promising means of improving the management of
marine resources as well as the economic performance of fishing industries,
and it portends profound changes in fishing regimes.

The available statistical data are analyzed to appraise the success of
Canada's Pacific salmon fleet rationalization program, in terms of the extent
to which it has prevented fishing costs from rising in pace with the value of
the catch.  It is found that while the fleet's revenues increased at about the
same rate before and after the scheme was introduced in 1969, the real capital
employed increased more slowly under the controls than earlier.  The program
has, nevertheless, failed in its purpose of preventing further expansion of
redundant capital in the fleet.  The reasons for this failure, and for certain522apparent shifts in the structure of the fleet, are discussed.

A multispecies model is introduced, applying techniques previously
described by T. Laevastu.  A stable solution for a typical Norwegian fjord is
obtained.  A stabilizing technique assuring convergence is used.  After
equilibrium is obtained, the ecosystem is released, and this 'out of control'
scenario is simulated.  A fleet regime is used, modelled through Cobb-Douglas
equations.  In addition a seabird dynamical regime was allowed to interact
with the aquatic system.  We found, despite release of previous constraints,
the biomass solution tends to exhibit stable behavior, though transients
occurs in a narrow time period after disturbance is applied.  The solution is
then moved to another equilibrium.  Disturbance is in the form of excessive
fishery, temperature oscillations, and removal of biomass due to airborne
predators.  The biomass dynamics during the year oscillates in a stable way,
expressing good annual dynamics.

The northern Gulf of Mexico shrimp fleet was monitored from 1972 to 1980
to estimate the magnitude and species composition of fish bycatch.  The
highest bycatch estimate occurred in the north central Gulf during the warm
season inside of 18 m.  The lowest estimate (3,944 mt) occurred in the eastern
Gulf in the same depth zone and season.  An estimated 576,028 mt of fish are
caught incidentally by the northern Gulf shrimp fleet annually.  The north
central Gulf influenced the bycatch heavily; contributing 50.3% of the total. 
Sciaenids dominated, comprising 52.47% with Atlantic croaker, Micropogonias

The rapid increase of fish prices has recently caused public concern. 
To find the cause of the difference between the price the fisherman receives
for his product and the ultimate price paid by the consumer, this report
provides an analysis of how the consumer's dollar is distributed to four
marketing levels: fisherman, processor, wholesaler, and retailer.
The difference or margin between selling and purchasing prices of each
level and the share of the consumer's dollar by each level and each cost
component are calculated for 14 fish products.  The report also analyzes the
costs and profits incurred by each marketing function and describes the major
influences on margin differences.
The purpose of the study is to provide a systematic guide that
individual firms in the fishery can use to examine their margins, costs, and
profits for each fish product, and compare them with the figures presented in
this study as national averages for the same product.

functional levels (harvesting, processing, wholesale, and retail), cost bills
are estimated and expanded to include all edible fish products harvested,

Distribution of fish products takes two other important channels (functional
levels) -- eating places and other food service institutions -- besides retail
stores to reach consumers.  Detailed estimates for 1972-77 are made for the
following: a cost bill at each functional level of every fishery, an outlay
for each cost item at six functional levels of each fishery, annual consumer
expenditure on each fish product, and per capita consumption of all edible
fish in dollar value.

Relationships and Environmental Influences on the Tiger Prawn

Aust. J. Mar. Freshw. Res. , 37:491-505.
A stock-recruitment relationship (SRR) between the spring spawning stock
levels and the following autumn recruitment has been established for P.
esculentus in Exmouth Gulf.  The basic SRR fits the data well with the
exception of 2 out of the 14 years when particularly severe cyclones occurred. 
This has been taken into account by using multiple regression techniques to
incorporate the amount of rainfall in January and February as variables
representing indices of cyclone activity (multiple correlation of 0.97).  A
hypothesis for the observed positive and negative effects of cyclones on
recruit survival has been presented.
The relationship between autumn recruitment and resultant spring
spawning stock (RSR) later that year and the effects of fishing, measured in
effective effort units, has also been established (multiple correlation  of
0.94).  An examination of the interaction between the SRR and RSR
relationships has been reported which suggests that, under average
environmental conditions and high levels of effort, recruitment will move
towards a new lower equilibrium level.  The robustness of the relationships
with respect to assumptions involved and potential sources of bias in the
variables used have been evaluated and discussed.

fishery and examined the implications of changes in the cost of acquiring debt
and equity capital on the industry's investment response.  Macroeconomic
policies that lead to high real interest rates depress real net investment in

Lafourche, and St. May, Louisiana.  These three parishes were selected so as
to coordinate this sociological study with the studies being carried out by

multidisciplinary project is a mark-recapture experiment conducted by a team
of biologists from the Center for Wetland Resources at Louisiana State
University in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service.  The
socio-demographic aspect of the study, presented here is intended to provide526information on the social and demographic setting of the mark-recapture
experiment.  Specifically, our goal was to analyze the existing body of data
concerning three aspects of the fishery: (1) the demographic structure of the
population residing in the tri-parish area; (2) the characteristics of
""shrimping communities"" and persons engaged in the fishery; (3) the social
organization of the fishery - the norms and values that govern the patterns of
interaction within the fishery.  In addition, we were to identify areas in
which additional data and research are needed to more fully understand the
fishery.

Natural resources are often produced jointly from composite ores that in
turn are extracted from fixed reserve endowments.  In this paper market
behavior is examined for such resources and it is shown how the price of each
resource will depend on its demand, and the demands and storage costs for the
other resources present in the ore.  The measurement of resource scarcity is
discussed and the effects of uncertainty over future resource demands are
examined.  It is shown that the competitive market will still extract,
produce, and store at socially optimal rates if firms are risk neutral and the
average cost of storage is constant.  Policy implications are noted,
particularly with reference to government stockpiling programs.

Potential monopoly power in extractive resource markets is reduced by
the depletability of reserves.  This paper examines the dependence of monopoly
power on resource rent, and on uncertainty over future reserve levels.  A
model is developed that treats reserves as inventories that fluctuate
stochastically over time as a result of exploration, development, and
production activities.  Solutions of the model illustrate how output and
monopoly power vary with the elasticity of demand, rent as a fraction of
price, and the variance of reserve fluctuations.  It is shown that uncertainty
over future reserves can speed up production, and by reducing resource rent,
restore part of the monopoly power otherwise lost because of depletion. 
Antitrust implications are also discussed.

In markets where price and output are determined intertemporally, the
standard Lerner index is a biased and sometimes misleading measure of actual
or potential monopoly power.  This paper shows how the Lerner index can be
modified to provide a meaningful instantaneous measure of monopoly power
applicable to dynamic markets, and discusses the aggregation of that
instantaneous measure across time.  The importance of accounting for
intertemporal constraints in antitrust and related applications is illustrated
by the analysis of four examples: an exhaustible resource, the ""learning529curve,"" costs of adjustment, and dynamic adjustment of demand.  An analogous
index of monopsony power applicable to dynamic markets is also suggested.

The natural growth rate of most renewable resource stocks is in part

uncertainty for competitive equilibrium in a market with property rights.  We
show that stochastic fluctuations add a risk premium to the rate of return
required to keep a unit of stock in situ, and we examine the effects of
fluctuations on resource rent.  Examples are used to show that extraction can
increase, decrease, or be left unchanged as the variance of the fluctuations
increases, depending of the extent of market ""self-correction"".  Regulatory
implications are also discussed.

The objective is the development of a bioeconomic model for optimal
management of fishing effort in some regions of the Mediterranean area.  A
catch-effort model, specifically built for multispecies and multi-gear
fisheries, has been developed using time series data of catch and fishing
effort.  The three catch-effort models have been tested on three homogeneous
sets of data for Italian, Spanish, and French fisheries using logistic and
biological models.  In the Italian and Spanish cases, both logistic dynamic
exponential models and biological Schnute model exhibit satisfactory
capabilities in describing catch and effort data, while Schaefer model
represents larger errors with respect to the previous applications to the
Italian fishery.  In the French case, the best results have been obtained by
the exponential model, while the Schaefer model failed in some species-areas
combinations.  Cost and revenues are evaluated by an economic submodel.  The
proposed optimal distributions of fishing effort, obtained by solving a
nonlinear constrained optimization problem by numerical techniques, show that
it is possible to achieve relevant benefits on both economic and biological
sites adopting articulate but realistic strategies for fishing effort
reduction and redistribution.
Plan Development Team (1990).  ""The Potential of Marine Fishery Reserves
for Reef Fish Management in the U.S. Southern Atlantic.""  NOAA
Technical Memorandum NMFS-SEFC-261, 40 pp.
Marine fishery reserves (MFRs), areas with no consumptive usage, are
recommended as a viable option for management of reef fisheries in the U.S.
southern Atlantic region.  MFRs are designed to protect reef fish stocks and
habitat from all consumptive exploitation within specified geographical areas
for the primary purpose of ensuring the persistence of reef fish stocks and
fisheries.  Fishery reserves are intended to protect older and larger fishes. 
This will benefit reef fisheries by protecting critical spawning stock
biomass, intra-specific genetic diversity, population age structure,
recruitment supply, and ecosystem balance while maintaining reef fish
fisheries.  The MFR concept is easily understandable by the general public and
possibly more easily accepted than some other management strategies.  Fishery
reserves provide some insurance against management and recruitment failures,
simplify enforcement, and have equitable impact among fishery users.  Data
collection needs solely for management are reduced and management occurs530without complete information and understanding about every species and
interaction.  Use of fishery reserves will establish U.S. leadership in
producing model strategies for cooperative international reef resource
management in the Caribbean.  Large resident fishes that wander out of
reserves can help maintain certain trophy fisheries.  MFR sites with natural
species equilibrium will allow measurement of age, growth, and natural
mortality for fisheries purposes and will provide a basis for other
educational, economic, and scientific benefits.  Because there is no fishing
within MFRs, impacts of hook and release mortality are eliminated and the
temptation for incidental poaching is reduced.  A mixed management strategy is
recommended where 20% of the shelf is MFR while the remaining 80% is managed
for optimal yield by any of several traditional options.  Coordinated fishery
reserve efforts in state waters would enhance the benefits of MFRs.  The short
term impacts on total harvest caused by placing fishing habitat into fishing
reserves should be compensated by long term fishery benefits.

Survey, A Comparative Analysis of Effort and Participation
Estimates in the Southeastern U.S.; 1979-1988."" NOAA Technical
Memorandum, NMFS-SEFC-269, March, 41 pp.
Although the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey measures
catch, effort, and participation, the focus of this report is on effort and
participation estimation.  While estimates of effort and participation are
used in many disciplines, they are critical for aggregation purposes in the
field of recreational economics.  Recreational economic models often focus
upon the average angler or trip.  To calculate total economic impacts from
these models for a state or subregion, the impacts from the average angler or
trip must be expanded by the appropriate estimate of subregional anglers or531trips.  State or subregional estimates of anglers or trips are therefore a
necessary component of the overall equation.  The economic impacts for the
average angler or trip are often relatively small when compared to the
aggregated estimates of effort or participation, therefore trip and angler
estimates often drive the total impact estimate.  As a result, it is very
important to obtain accurate estimates of trips and anglers.

Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Regional Office, 9450 Koger Blvd., St. Petersburg, FL.
The recreational sector has been broken down into three primary red
snapper oriented fishing modes: private boat, head/party boat, and charter
boat (shoreline mode is not a significant mode for this species due to the
need to access reefs).  The private boat sector represents self captained boat
based fishing activity by anglers owning or renting boats.  Head/party and
charter boats reflect the ""for hire"" recreational fishing sector where anglers
hire the services of a captain and boat.  Heat boats represent those crafts
(regardless of size) where price is figured on a per head basis.  Charter boat
prices are figured on a per trip basis regardless of the size of the fishing
party.  For each red snapper management alternative, a qualitative discussion
shall be presented for each of these subsectors of the overall recreational
sector.

pp.
This dissertation deals with the economic problem of managing stocks of
replenishable natural resources in situations where the product that is
derived from the resource is of commercial value and where use of the resource
is not privately owned.  Two basic models are developed to describe the
economy and to identify the problems of resource utilization; costless532production and then a two good market with labor costs.  Quotas and taxes are
studied as two possible management measures to achieve social welfare
optimality.  Lastly, maximum sustained yield conservation measures are found
to have little economic merit.

Geometric representations of two dynamic models of replenishable natural

where the only cost of production is the opportunity foregone.  That is,
present consumption implies a reduction in future consumption possibilities. 
Diagrams show the iterations of an optimal program.  A four-quadrant diagram
is used to illustrate a short run equilibrium and the dynamics that will lead
to a long run solution on the bionomic transformation curve.

Economics: The Role of the Discount Rate.""  Marine Resource
Economics , 1(2):155-170.
Standard models of management of a single species fishery generally
assume that the biomass is of known size and that it is generated by a well
specified deterministic growth law.  In reality the biomass is of uncertain
size and usually subject to random growth.  Several authors have addressed the
problem of random growth assuming a known initial biomass and have shown that
lowering the planning discount rate proportional to the variance is an optimal
planning procedure assuming small perturbations.  In this paper, we assume
that the growth function is nonrandom but dependent upon a biomass stock of
unknown size.  We shall show that a planner should raise the discount rate
relative to the certainty equivalent case by an amount related to society's
distaste for risk to manage the biomass optimally over time.  As is to be
expected, the optimal steady state biomass will be less than would occur in a
situation of certainty.
Plourde, Charles and J. Barry Smith (1989).  ""Crop Sharing in the
Fishery and Industry Equilibrium.""  Marine Resource Economics ,
6(3):179-193.
This article presents a model of commercial fishing in a stochastic
environment that focuses on the labor-employment contract.  In a partial
equilibrium context, the authors show that when boat owners and crew members
are risk averse, crop sharing is the optimal contract, and the resultant labor
employment level will be greater than with a suboptimal wage contract. 
Industry effects and steady state resource growth limitations are introduced
into a market equilibrium model.  In this extended model, market equilibria
will also involve sharing contracts.  These will result in greater employment,
which comes at the expense of reduced resource stocks and higher than
necessary harvesting costs.  The article also examines how industry regulation
such as licensing, quotas, and subsidies will differ if the prevailing
contract is corp sharing as compared with a wage.  Despite the fact that crop533sharing contracts are privately optimal in a regulated setting, they may not
be socially optimal.

Replenishable Fish Stock: A Noncooperative Game Solution.""  Marine
Resource Economics , 6(1):57-70.
In this study we use a N-person differential game structure to represent
a renewable resource industry in which the decision agents are few in number
and noncooperative (as would be the case, for example, in international
fishing wars).  As an illustration we assume an environment similar to that
presented by Levhari and Mirman (1980) to derive a set of tractable
strategies.  Although there is no guarantee that the stock size would always
be positive with human harvesting in the Levhari and Mirman case, our model
provides growth dynamics that rule out negative stocks.  Explicit solutions of
equilibrium game strategies and a steady state level of stock are derived. 
Finally, we demonstrate that in situations when stock size enters the
production function, combined maximization such as an international treaty is
more ""conservative"" than individual maximization.

western North Atlantic off the United States, extending from 32o N to 45o N
and from 76o W to 63o W.  To locate and describe fronts, we used three
variables computed from satellite derived sea surface temperature (SST):
horizontal gradient, distance to nearest thermal surface front, and frontal
density.  Most of the fishing effort analyzed occurred along the edge of the
continental shelf, where there was a high frequency of frontal presence.  Very
high catch per unit effort (CPUE) occurred more frequently in the vicinity of
fronts than would be expected by chance.  The high CPUE variability that could
not be explained by our frontal parameters suggested other, unmeasured factors
also influenced catch rates.

Characteristics of Reef-Fish Vessels in the South Atlantic and

Cost and revenue data collected from reef fish fishermen in the
southeastern United States provided a comprehensive financial and operational
profile of commercial fishing vessels during 1980-1981.  Analysis of variance
test showed that significant differences existed between vessels operated in
the south Atlantic areas versus vessels operated in the eastern Gulf of
Mexico, although the financial characteristics of these vessels were not
significantly different.  On the contrary, the financial characteristics of
vessels using bottom longlines were significantly different than vessels
equipped with the traditional handline fishing gear.  Owner operated vessels
also had significantly better financial performance than firm operated
vessels.  Returns to labor, management, and owner's equity showed considerably
larger returns for longline equipped and owner operated vessels compared to
handline equipped and firm operated vessels.  The former two groups of vessels
also were comparatively more efficient based on three measures of vessel
efficiency.  Lastly, risk analyses were performed for several operational and
financial characteristics of these vessels, and they showed little or no
difference in risk between vessels equipped with longlines compared to vessels
using handlines.  Comparisons of risk, however, did indicate that owner
operated vessels were operated less conservatively than vessels operated by
nonowners.  Errors in data collection, inappropriate use of statistical
procedures, and understanding the concept of risk abound in this analysis.

A federal regulation closes the fishery conservation zone (FCZ) in the
Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Texas to fishing for brown shrimp beginning in
late May until the middle of July when the area is reopened to commercial
fishing.  The objective of this regulation is to essentially eliminate fishing
mortality on brown shrimp during a period of rapid growth in their life
cycles.  Analyses are preformed to estimate the effects of these regulations
on the amount of shrimp caught and landed and the value of the catch.  The
effects on catch are estimated in Nichols (1986) and his estimates are used to
estimate the effects of the closure on ex-vessel prices and value.  According
to Nichols, the closure during May through mid July, 1984 resulted in an
increase of 1.4 million pounds of brown shrimp.  This increase in landings is
estimated to have resulted in an increase in total revenue to the fishery of
about $18.7 million.  Preliminary estimates for the May to mid July, 1985
closure are also provided that indicate a range of impacts from a loss of $5.2
million to a gain of $756 thousand.

""Intracultural Variability in the Cognition of Danger Among
Southern New England Fishers.""  Marine Resource Economics ,
11(1):23-30.
The costs of the dangers of commercial fishing are very high, yet
fishing vessel safety regulations are frequently met with lack of enthusiasm
or even rejection by fisheries.  Why would fishers reject regulations designed
to increase their safety?  There is a strong possibility that some of the
rejection is the result of lack of cognitive sharing and communication between
originators of the regulations and the fishers for whom the regulations are
designed.  This paper examines the pattern of cognition about danger of the
occupation among fishers and relates these patterns to sociocultural
differences in two southern New England ports.  The intent of the study is to
help bridge the gap between regulators and users by providing culturally
appropriate information that can be used to design more effective policy,
training , and enforcement programs.

""Factors Influencing the Success of Fishermen's Cooperatives in
Ecuador.""  Marine Resource Economics , 5(3):231-242.
The fishermen's cooperative is viewed by many as the ideal type of
organization for use in improving the welfare of fishermen in development
projects (cf. Meynell, 1984; Jentoft, 1986).  Major development agencies such
as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World
Bank also advocate their use.  For example, a review of World Bank fishery
projects between 1976 and 1981 indicated that 53% involved fishermen's
cooperatives (Pollnac, 1985).  Judging from the relatively high failure rate
that appears to exist for this type of organization, however, it is clear that
their development is a difficult matter.
The success of fishermen's cooperatives depends on a large number of
factors as evidenced by the numerous variables identified in the literature
for local organizations in general (Esman and Uphoff, 1984) and fishermen's
organizations in particular (Poggie, 1980a; Meynell, 1984; Pollnac, 1988). 
Pollnac (1985) identified no fewer than 21 important determinants of success
for fishermen's organizations, some of which are clusters of variables.  It
appears, however, that there may be several important dimensions that underlie
the reported concomitants of the success and failure of fishermen's
organizations.  As a means of furthering our understanding of these basic
dimensions, this study analyzes a number of items reported in the literature
to be associated with the success and failure of this type of organization.538Polinsky, A. Mitchell and Steven Shavell (1975).  ""The Air Pollution and

This paper provides a critique of the household production function
approach and its application to the allocation of time.  It is argued that
many applications of the model, especially those making use of implicit

returns and no joint production; otherwise, implicit commodity prices depend
on the household's preferences as well as on its technology and the prices of
market goods.  Furthermore, joint production is pervasive in situations
involving the allocation of time.  In situations where household production
theory does not provide a satisfactory framework for analysis, the paper
suggests alternative approaches.

Rock Lobster Jasus lalandii  with Notes on Larval Recruitment.   Can. J.
Fish. Aquat. Sci. , 43:2107-2117.
The South African fishery for the rock lobster Jasus lalandii  currently
yields about 3800 metric tons (8.4 million animals) of which more than 90% are
males.  Males grow much faster than females, and a size limit which is fairly
large in relation to the size and age at maturity protects females from
exploitation for most of their life spans, thereby ensuring a high level of
larval production from the population.  Exploitation rates in the fishery are
controlled by means of quotas on fishing companies, as well as catch limits on
individual fishing grounds.  Quotas are reassessed annually to maintain
instantaneous fishing mortality rates of approximately 0.3 on all grounds. 540Catch rates on most grounds have been increasing since area catch limits were
introduced in 1980, and seasonal averages now vary between 3 and 12 kg per
trap-day.  Although annual indices of puerulus larval recruitment are not
available, and the stock-recruitment relationship is unknown, it appears that
relatively stable yields can be maintained despite fluctuations in puerulus
recruitment.  Density dependent regulatory mechanisms operative in juvenile
and young adult stages tend to dampen large variations in the numbers of
adults entering the fishable size range each year.  Variations in puerulus
recruitment are likely to result from changes in the paths and velocities of
extensive offshore currents which eventually return larvae toward the coast of
South Africa after many months of pelagic existence.

A common property resource with open access, such as a fishery, will be
used to excess when faced with sufficient demand.  This will lead to an
excessive amount of effort on the part of the fishery, resulting in a
depletion of the stock.  This paper discusses the development of a property
rights regime for the Atlantic calico scallop, Argopecten  gibbus, fishery of
Florida.  The management solution of the Calico Scallop Conservation
Association (CSCA) provides an example of the assignment of property rights to
a common property resource without resorting to governmental intervention.  In
this particular fishery, self regulation limited early harvesting is
uneconomic; there may be other fisheries in which self regulation could be
economically efficient and biologically appropriate.  While this solution may
not be applicable to all common property resources, for those cases that may
be similar, the example of the CSCA provides valuable information that may be
helpful in establishing a more efficient use of the resource.  Some types of
government facilitation may also be useful.

The implications of separability in production are examined using
duality.  Restrictions on the profit function implied by separability of the
production function, and vice versa, are derived in a simple way.  These
restrictions are then calculated for commonly used classes of functional542forms.  Then the method is used to test separability of the profit function
using experimental production data.  The hypothesis that the profit function
was separable (plant nutrients from spacing unit costs) could not be rejected. 
This implies that an aggregate price index for nutrients is appropriate.

Although subsidies have been a major issue in international trade

Workshop.""   National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast
Fisheries Center, 75 Virginia Beach Drive, Miami, FL 33149, March,
47 pp.
In conducting this evaluation of large coastal shark groups, the
committee found that for many species considered, shark abundance in waters
off the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts is depressed due to fishing
removals.  Catch rate information indicates that the abundance of many of the
species and species groups could have declined by about 50 to 75% from the
early 1970's to the mid 1980's.  The downward trend in available CPUE
observations probably accurately reflects further shark abundance decreases
since 1986 when shark catches dramatically increased until the 1993 quota was
adopted.  Recovery of this resource to levels of the 1970's will be slow
(perhaps 30 years or more in some cases), due to the relatively low intrinsic
rates of increase exhibited by most shark species.  Measuring recovery or
decline under a TAC implemented in 1993, even with precise abundance indices,
may not be possible for a decade or more.  Given the information available,
increases in the TAC for sharks were considered risk prone with respect to
promoting stock recovery.  In fact, considering the reproductive profiles of
sharks and the general insufficiency of fishery data upon which to base
analyses, any TAC might be considered risk prone relative to stock recovery of
large coastals.  To increase the probability of recovery, the single most
important measure, supplemental to controlling the annual harvest level, that
might be implemented is a closure of nursery grounds to directed fishing
during the pupping season.  The greatest impediments to improving shark stock
assessments continue to be the general lack of species and size specific catch
(landed and discarded) and effort data, as well as only limited fishery
independent measures of shark abundance and productivity.

Despite the uncertainties in the data, the analysis of Nichols et al.

production of red snappers and mackerels by reduction of bycatch.  It appears
that the potential is largest for red snapper, where reduction in bycatch
might increase yield by as much as 90 percent.  The potential for percentage
increase in Spanish mackerel yield in reducing bycatch is less than that for
red snapper; the potential is even less for king mackerel.

Uncertainty in the processing and marketing sector arise in the sales of
final products, the procurement of seafood supplies, and the operation of the
marketing firm or processing plant.  Major uncertainties in marketing and
processing seafoods are associate with inferior market price and quantity
data, time delays between procurement of raw product and sales of final
products, breakdown in market signals between market levels, product image
changes, and export sales.  Major supply related uncertainties are associated
with variations in environmental and biological factors, factors determining
type and quantity of fishing effort, government regulations, and foreign
supply factors.  Uncertainties internal to the operation of processing and
marketing firms are encountered through storage-related activities, new546technology, government regulations, and new product and market development
activities.  Uncertainties associated with foreign trade appear to be of
extreme importance because of the relative growth and size of foreign markets.

U.S. Shrimp Imports.""  Draft report, Department of Food and
Resource Economics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.
Imported shrimp accounted for over one half of the annual shrimp
consumption in the U.S. through 1981.  This relatively large proportion of the
total market is alleged to cause serious financial problems for the domestic
shrimp fishing sector by lowering prices, especially during periods of
declining U.S. demand for shrimp.  Tariffs and quotas have repeatedly been
suggested by shrimp fishermen and their representatives as a solution to the
fishermen's problems with the latest organized effort in the early 1980's. 
Since that time increased world shrimp supplies, principally from mariculture,548have caused new concerns for the U.S. shrimp fishing industry.  Imports
increased dramatically since 1981 reaching a high of 421 million pounds (heads
off) in 1983 that accounts for over 70 percent of the supply of shrimp in the
U.S.  Opposition to tariffs and quotas comes from three sources.  Consumers
feel shrimp available for consumption would be reduced and would be available
only at considerably higher prices.  Marketing and processing firms contend
that the cost of operations would be increased due to a reduction in volume of
shrimp for processing and marketing.  Finally, industry analysis hypothesize
that increased ex-vessel prices due to reduced imports will be at best a short
run solution to the low or negative economic returns due to the expected
increased entry into the fishery associated with the increased prices.

that a catch-effort data system would emerge, which would provide information
concerning species and number of individual fish, effort expended, gear type

 Technology Adoption Decisions Under Irreversibility and Uncertainty: An
Ex Ante Approach.   American Journal of Agricultural Economics ,
77(3):541-551.
Empirical results demonstrate that uncertainty about costs and
requirements for environmental compliance is an important determinant of dairy
producers  investment behavior.  Ex ante forecasting of how uncertainty and
irreversibility are likely to affect producers  responsiveness to agricultural
technologies has implications for the design of environmental policies. 
Simulation modeling methods are described.  The empirical analysis focuses on
Texas producers  propensity to adopt free stall dairy housing.  Free stall
investments offer advantages for both productivity augmentation and pollution
abatement, yet uncertainty and irreversibility are obstacles to adoption. 
Implications of this ex ante paradigm for policy design and implementation are
discussed.

occur in the harvest of groundfish.  The empirical results demonstrate the
presence of substantial latent losses associated with salmon PSC reproductive
potential foregone and confirm the presence of the hypothesized long run
adverse economic impacts on directed salmon fisheries associated with a single

king crab, and Tanner crab, although substantial research on the biological
impacts of PSC losses on these species remains to be done.

It follows that traditional TCM yields only ordinally measurable welfare

Both experience and economic models show that, in the absence of
enforceable access or catch restrictions, competition among commercial
fishermen results in an expansion of fishing capacity and effort beyond the
sustainable limits of the fish population being pursued.  Although sometimes
conceived as a means for easing financial hardship caused by reduced landings
of fish, capacity reduction is more often viewed as a measure to realign
effort and eventually increase sustainable catch levels.  Unlike economic aid,
however, capacity reduction aims to provide long-term benefits to those
choosing, or able, to remain within the industry and may thus indirectly
confer benefits to some of the communities that these fisheries support.

 Biological and Economic Foundations of Renewable Resource
Exploitation.   Ecological Economics , 26:227-242.
A physiologically based population dynamics model of a renewable
resource is used as the basis to develop a model of human harvesting.  The
model incorporates developing technology and the effects of market forces on
the sustainability of common property resources.  The bases of the model are
analogies between the economics of resource harvesting and allocation by firms
and adapted organisms in nature.  Specifically, the paper makes the following
points: (1) it shows how economic and ecological theories may be unified; (2)
it punctuates the importance of time frame in the two systems (evolutionary
versus market); (3) it shows, contrary to prevailing economic wisdom, how
discount rates on resource use can be catastrophic when synergized by progress
in harvesting technology; (5)it suggests that increases in efficiency of
utilization of the harvest encourages higher levels of resource exploitation;
and (6) it shows the effects of environmental degradation on consumer and
resource dynamics.  The model leads to global implications on the relationship
between economic growth and the ability of modern societies to maintain the
environment at a sustainable level.

efficiency reflects observed to maximum revenue, including the non-positive
revenue of bad outputs.  It can be decomposed into technical and environmental
efficiency.  Our parametric output distance function allows the
characteristics of non-point source pollution.  Shadow prices of the
undesirable output (nitrogen surplus per hectare) are found to be positive for557all observations, due to the materials balance definition of nitrogen surplus. 
Intensive farms are found to be slightly more resource use efficient than

ITQ regulations in the Pacific halibut fishery will provide some benefit
to the severely overcapitalized halibut fishery.  However, the ITQ program may
threaten resource sustainability by providing fishermen with an incentive to
exceed their quota and high-grade their catch.  In addition, the quota
consolidation, job loss, and costs that will result from the new system will
raise several ethical concerns regarding the ideas of social equity,
efficiency, and stewardship.  Based on traditional conservation ethics as well
as more modern ideas, the envirocentric ethical approach to quota management
can be used to address some of these environmental and ethical problems.

The high price of flying fish eggs in Japan encourages South Sulawesi
fishermen in Indonesia to harvest increasing quantities of eggs every year. 
Similarly, the increasing local demand for flying fish encourages Indonesian
fishermen to use gill nets to catch more fish.  As a consequence of this
increasing quantity of eggs harvested and fish caught, Indonesia has become
concerned about the over exploitation of the flying fish population.
Thus far policy suggestions concerning the management of the flying fish
fishery have been based on a static biological model, since the data needed to
construct a dynamic bioeconomic model are very limited.  This paper presents a
method for constructing a dynamic bioeconomic model of the Indonesian flying
fish fishery with very limited data on the fish population.  A calibration
technique is developed to build the dynamic biological model.

to exhibit sexually dimorphic growth.  For analysis, hypothetical populations
of swordfish were simulated using trends in recruitment and mortality loosely
based on the 1989 ICCAT assessment.  The range of dimorphic growth hypotheses
defined was based on the analysis of Berkeley and Houde and that of Erhardt.

An aged structured production model (ASPM) has been used in past
assessments of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tunas, particularly for albacore tuna in the southern Atlantic, and for
bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic.  That model is sometimes preferable to
traditional biomass-based surplus production models because it can accommodate
age-structured indices of relative abundance.  The ASPM estimates a
deterministic stock-recruitment relationship, a property that may result in
inconsistencies between the estimated level of recruitment and the observed
level of catches for recent cohorts.  In this work, we relax the deterministic
assumption by incorporating stochasticity in recruitment around the
deterministic predictions as a first-order, autoregressive time-series
process.  We use data for western Atlantic bluefin tuna to contrast the
deterministic and stochastic model fits, and examine the differences that
would result in management advice based on projections with either model.

The usefulness of virtual population analysis (VPA) for estimating
mortality and population size independently of fishing effort data has led to
detailed analyses of the quality of the estimates given various sources of
error in the inputs.  For the most part, these studies have dealt with the
possible consequences of using erroneous inputs or inputs characterized by
some degree of uncertainty.  Largely ignored in the literature is the problem
of biases due specifically to systematic errors in ageing.  In this study, we
use simulation analysis to examine the performance of three methods to handle
the plus group.  The analyses that follow are focused on the effects that
systematic ageing errors may have on the conclusions drawn from the VPAs.  The
simulations are loosely based on swordfish ( Xiphias  gladius ) data from the

Information about differences in sex ratio at size and possible sexual
dimorphism in growth have raised questions regarding likely biases that may be
incurred during swordfish stock assessments.  In this study, the 1978-89 catch
at length data is separated into sexes and converted into catch at age using
three growth curves (two sex specific ones and the one used in the 1990
assessment).  The U.S. and Spain CPUE data were treated similarly to derive
age specific indices of abundance for each sex-growth curve combination. 
Virtual population analyses (VPAs) were carried out on the resulting data sets
to better understand how trends in population size and fishing mortality may
differ depending on the growth hypothesis used.

Management , 4(3):231-248.
License limitation is finding increasing acceptance.  Reasons for growth
in license control include its relationship to other management measures and
its similarity to other forms of public regulation in North American. 
Experiences with license control in several areas of the United States and561Canada are reviewed and evaluated in terms of the conservation objectives,
economic efficiency, equity, and administrative/political feasibility.  These
programs are seen as diverse both in their design and the success achieved. 
Further use of license control is expected, requiring better information on
consequences for multipurpose and multispecies fisheries.  Although fishermen
are extensively involved in the design of license limitation programs, new
techniques for obtaining the views of fishermen are needed.

What are the economic consequences of policies that allocate fishing

answers to this complex and difficult question are simple, understandable, and
wrong.   The debate over the appropriate use of input-output analysis and its
relationship with the calculation of net economic benefits was a central part
of national debates about public investments that took place in the 1960's and

The south Atlantic snapper grouper fishery exhibits economic
characteristics and problems common to other commercial marine fisheries. 
Fishermen involved in this fishery also have socio-demographic characteristics
as well as cultural and social problems that need investigation.  Because
there was a lack of up to date relevant social and cultural data, this project
sought to provide selected socio-demographic data on commercial reef fishermen
needed in supporting and evaluating management actions, especially by the
South Atlantic Fishery Management Council.  The research was comprised of two
components, qualitative and quantitative.  Primary data were collected via
focus groups, ethnographic interviews, and a self-administered survey mailed
to inactive and active commercial reef fishermen in the south Atlantic.  In
general, the qualitative findings suggest that frustration among snapper
grouper fishermen is mounting.  However, most are likely to continue their way
of life.

The goal of this project was to collect primary economic data on
federally permitted commercial reef (snapper-grouper) fishermen in the south
Atlantic region.  The lack of economic data has been a significant problem in
the evaluation of current and proposed fishery management plans developed by
the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council.  Researchers surveyed federal
snapper-grouper permit holders with home ports in Georgia, South Carolina,
North Carolina, and the east coast of Florida.  Data collected through
personal interviews during 1994 included vessel characteristics, annual fixed
expenses, typical trip revenues and expenses, and incremental costs associated
with switching to and from commercial reef fishing.  Economic data collected
in this survey will be useful in developing economic models to simulate
incremental private sector benefits, costs, and distributional effects on
commercial snapper-grouper fishermen associated with proposed regulatory
actions in this Region by the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council and
other regulatory agencies.

During June-September 1978, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in
cooperation with the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation
attempted to determine the commercial harvest potential of Spanish mackerel
along the Texas coast using a modified purse seine, gill net, and troll lines. 
Spanish mackerel life history data were also obtained.  Few fish were located;
rough seas and turbid water prevented extensive sampling with either the net
or the purse seine.  Most Spanish mackerel were observed in or near passes. 
The incidental catch of other game species in the modified purse seine was
minor; the incidental catch was composed mainly of bait fish on which the
mackerel were feeding.  A total of 208 fish were tagged for growth and
migration studies.  Stomach analyses indicated that bumper ( Chloroscombrus
chrysurus ) was the most common food item eaten by Spanish mackerel. During
August and September, 72% of the 58 fish examined had developing or ripe
gonads.

Groundfish catch and effort data for the west coast of Canada have been
based primarily on unverified skipper logbooks.  In 1992, a voluntary observer
program was conducted for the multispecies trawl fishery operating in one
area.  In this paper, we relate observer records to skipper logbooks for
comparable tows and for tows on unobserved vessels fishing simultaneously over
three time periods.  One hypothesis we considered is that skippers would
behave differently when observers were present.  In particular, vessels
without observers would target a different species mix than vessels with
observers.  There are strong economic incentives to land preferred species in
excess of trip quotas.  Furthermore, trips with observers accounted for only
5-12% of the total number of tows.  We found reasonable agreement in species
composition between observer records and logbooks from observed and unobserved
tows in most cases.  Thus, we could not support the hypothesis.  However,
observers recorded consistently lower values for total catch and higher values
for effort than were reported in logbooks.  As much as 9% of the effort from
observed tows was not reported on logbooks.  More stringent regulations apply
to fishing areas where fewer observed trips have been conducted.  The
reliability of logbooks from these areas remains unknown.

Stock Status and the Recreational Fishery."" Marine Fisheries
Review, 49(2):58-66.
The striped bass, Morone saxatilis , has long been a prized sport fish
for anglers along the U.S. Atlantic coast.  Between 1960 and 1970, the
estimated recreational harvest of striped bass nearly doubled while the number
of striped bass anglers increased by almost tow thirds.  However, since the
mid to late 1970's, commercial and recreational harvests of striped bass have
decreased to their lowest levels on record.  These declines are due primarily
to poor production of juveniles by the Chesapeake stock.  Although stringent
management measures have been implemented to rebuild the stock, juvenile
production is unlikely to improve until the protected year classes mature and
spawn over the next several years.  The future of striped bass fishing depends
on successful reproduction by these protected year classes and on management
measures that maintain an adequate spawning stock.

A simulation model is used to compare measures for future management
identified in the American Lobster fishery management plan; specifically,
increases in the minimum legal size and a modest reduction in aggregate
fishing mortality are evaluated.  The analysis differs from previous work in
that the distributional aspects of the alternative management regulations are
quantified.  The results indicate that (1) both an increase minimum size and a
reduction in fishing mortality are economically justified in the sense that
net benefits are positive; (2) increasing the minimum size without an adjunct
regulation to prohibit entry will cause present fishermen to suffer an initial
short term reduction in revenues for which there will be no long term gain;
(3) because increased minimum size can be justified on the basis of consumer
benefits alone, arguments favoring its increase to prevent recruitment failure
are moot as far as a test of national economic efficiency is concerned; and
(4) a program of effort reduction that reduces by 20% the fraction of
available lobsters captured annually is projected to generate $1 of producer
benefits for every pound of lobster landed.  Reducing the annual harvest
fraction by 20% results in a level of fishery benefits greater than increasing
the minimum size to 89 mm (3.5 inches), and increases the coincidence of short
run costs and long term benefits among those impacted by fishery management.

The optimal pricing and use of a natural resource is reconsidered with
respect to intergenerational equity considerations.  It is assumed that in a
just economy, each generation chooses the plan that maximizes its won utility,
subject to the constraint that the plan should not be exploitative in the
sense that each generation does not take advantage of its earlier point in
time with respect to future generations.  It is shown that if the cost of
production of an alternative energy source (e.g. solar) is sufficiently high
relative to the stock of naturally stored energy, the constraints of justice
result in a lower rate of energy use initially, but a higher rate later.

implemented new legislation, or issued new directives for state planners to
avoid or mitigate problems that may result form similar  takings  cases. 
Additionally, states are exhibiting greater caution due to increased concern

intervention of a self-interested government which must be able to promise
credibly to limit the issue of money.  To achieve credibility, the government
must offset the benefits of seigniorage by internalizing some of the
macroeconomic externalities generated by the issue of fiat money.  The
government's patience and the extent of its involvement in the economy are key
determinants of whether the transition can be accomplished.

submodel, taking into account the effects of water temperature, feeding level,
oxygen content, and water supply.  Stochastic effects in growth and mortality,
relating to the effects of genetic differences, can be also considered in the
model.  An economic submodel evaluates costs and revenues relating to plant
management .  The model exhibits good capabilities in predicting the effects
of operating variables on fish growth and on economic outcomes and in
determining the optimal strategies for plant management in different
scenarios, considering the complex interactions of technical, biological, and
economic aspects.
Roberts, Callum M. and Nicholas V.C. Polunin (1993).  ""Marine Reserves:
Simple Solutions to Managing Complex Fisheries.""  Ambio,
22(6):363-368.
Fisheries on coral reefs are highly complex, can be very productive, but
typically have little or no management.  Widespread overfishing and declining
yields reveal an acute need for proper management.  However, conventional
management methods are inappropriate for two main reasons: they require much
information on the biology of stocks and are expensive and difficult to568enforce.  Use of marine reserves has been suggested as an alternative. 
Protective management potentially has several important benefits including (i)
protection os spawning stocks; (ii) provision of recruits to replenish fishing
grounds; (iii) enhancement of catches in adjacent unprotected areas through
emigration; (iv) minimal requirement for information on biology of stocks; and
(v) ease of enforcement.  However, the effectiveness of the reserve approach
has not been properly tested.  We evaluate the evidence available to test
whether reserves function as predicted on theoretical grounds.  In general,
field studies from widespread sites around the globe support predictions of
increases in abundance and average size of fishes in protected areas. 
However, evidence for enhanced catches in adjacent areas is more limited, and
evidence to show that reserves can restock fishing grounds is lacking. 
Nevertheless, protective management appears to hold much promise for low cost
management of reef fisheries.  Research programs in several areas of the
Caribbean and Indo-Pacific have now been launched to refine the approach.

Louisiana Shrimp Vessels, 1978.""  Sea Grant Publication No. LSU-
TL-79-007, Center for Wetland Resources, Louisiana State
University, Baton Rouge, LA, December, 9 pp.
The excellent shrimp harvests of 1977 and 1978 have brought increased
interest in shrimp vessels as investment opportunities.  Adding to investor
interest in 1978 were the favorable price and record dockside value of shrimp
(the previous record value was exceeded by 16 percent).  Shrimpers and other
investors will respond to the record earnings by constructing new vessels. 
Financial incentives such as the Capital Construction Fund (CCF) and the
sheltering of capital gains from vessel appreciation also attract investment. 
The CCF and capital gains incentives are long term, but the shrimp harvests
vary from year to year.  The result is that investment in the form of vessels
drawn into the fishery due to tax incentives will negatively impact earnings
per vessel when catches and prices return to normal.  This may result in
stress on the credit system and shrimp management alternatives, as well as
bring about public assistance to help an ailing industry.  Based on a survey
of 129 operators, shrimp vessels harvested the same quantity of shrimp in 1978
as they did in the record year of 1977 with 1978 prices higher than 1977,
resulting in an above average financial condition for shrimp vessels.  The
financial condition of shrimp vessels in 1978 may be hard to improve on as
shrimp catches retreat from record levels, more vessels begin shrimping, and
costs continue to increase.569Roberts, Kenneth J. and Mark E. Thompson (1983).  ""Petroleum Production

""The Impact of Imports, Including Farm-Raised Shrimp, on the
Southeast Shrimp Processing Sector.""  NOAA Technical Memorandum
NMFS-SEFC-305, USDOC, NOAA, NMFS, January.
Processing activities of southeastern shrimp processors increased in
recent years.  This activity was linked to an increase in shrimp imports.  An
initial source of the new supply was Ecuador.  Farming of shrimp in pond
systems there rapidly increased United States purchases to a record 101
million pounds by 1987.  Shrimp from China and Taiwan added another 80 million
pounds to US supplies by 1987.  Imports primarily from shrimp farming nations
were thereby recognized by some processors as a new source of raw material. 
Twelve of the surveyed processors in the southeast began use of imported
shrimp after 1984.  New sources of supply introduced an element of stability
to the southeastern industry for those processors using the shrimp.  Stability
in terms of entry and exit among the region's establishments utilizing imports
was found to be higher than non-users.  Hence, as more establishments adopt
the use of imports, especially farm-raised imports, in their processing
activities, total industry stability in the southeast may be expected to rise. 
The analysis indicated a possible decline in industry concentration in 1987. 
This decline to the extent that it might be related to increasing raw material
availability and hence, less ability among the larger firms to exhibit some
control over input usage, suggests that an additional decline in concentration
might be forthcoming as aquaculture supplies expand.  Exporting countries with
farmed shrimp supplies could at some point lessen these influences on
southeastern processors if they increase their value added processing.

in and around the Tortugas Sanctuary, 1981-1983.""  North American
Journal of Fisheries Management , 6:311-327.
Size and abundance of pink shrimp ( Penaeus  duorarum ) in and around the
Tortugas sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico were surveyed monthly from September
1981 through July 1983.  Samples were not taken in April and June 1983. 
Shrimp size varied widely at most stations and abundance varied between
stations, but the average size increased with increasing depth and abundance
decreased with increasing depth.  A large proportion of small shrimp (<103 mm
total length) in all samples combined monthly were caught inside the
sanctuary, but their abundance varied monthly and annually.  Small pink shrimp
dominated the catch from fewer than half the stations inside the sanctuary in
September-December 1981 but increased in abundance and dominated half or more
of the stations inside the sanctuary in January-December 1982 and February-May
1983.  January and July were the only months in which catches from at least
half the stations inside the sanctuary were composed mostly of shrimp at least
103 mm long in 1983.  Recruitment was continuous but uneven throughout the
survey.  Peak months of recruitment varied annually, occurring in January and
July-September 1982 and in January and March 1983.  Small shrimp were less
abundant outside the sanctuary but peaks in abundance at some stations outside

This dissertation analyses the economic impact of recreational and

from recreational fishing is estimated to be between $13 and $25 million while
producer and consumer surplus from the commercial gillnet fishery is over
$875,000.  The economic impact of the recreational fishery is almost $13
million and $3.3 million for the commercial fishery.  Since the biological and
technical relationships between the catches of the two sectors cannot be
determined, it is not possible to derive an optimal allocation of fish between
them.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the Authement-Ledet Excluder, Cameron
Shooter, Lake Arthur Excluder, and the Eymard Accelerator Bycatch Reduction
Devices (BRDs) in inshore waters, tests were conducted in three areas of
coastal Louisiana during the spring and fall shrimp seasons using a twin
trawl, with a BRD on one side and a control net on the other.  Shrimp and
finfish loss varied between the different BRDs and depended upon the species
and size of organisms within each test area.  Estimates of the value of shrimp
loss or gain using each BRD prototype are also provided.  BRD designs with
increased finfish reduction and minimal shrimp loss appear achievable. 
However, the high variability of bycatch species and length-frequency
distributions suggests that devices may have to be designed for specific areas
and possibly different seasons to release a particular or abundant species.

Two market schemes for controlling water pollution, effluent charges,

superior to charges, but market mechanisms must also be supplemented by non-
market regulatory devices.  Rights are preferred to charges because they (1)
assure the attainment of water quality thresholds; (2) minimize inequities;
(3) provide a means of subsidizing municipalities without sacrificing
efficiency; (4) permit growth without burdening existing dischargers; and (5)
provide a way to handle emergencies.  In addition, they can be incorporated
into the existing legislation without a drastic revision of the Water
Pollution Control Act of 1972.

characteristics space, buyer and seller choices, as well as the meaning and
nature of market equilibrium, are analyzed.  Empirical implications for
hedonic price regressions and index number construction are pointed out.

The precautionary approach to fishery management seeks to protect
fishery resources from fishing practices that may put their long term
viability in jeopardy.  To take appropriate precautions, fishing activities
may need to be controlled even before there is clear scientific evidence that
current practices can not be sustained by the resource.  To develop fishery
control policies, biological reference points are needed for measuring current
resource status and the projected effects of fishing.

Conditions under which the unregulated equilibrium will be MEY are explored. 
In addition, a tax is devised that will cause non-MEY competitive exploitation
to become MEY when the tax is implemented.

models are developed from a common data base representing 60,000 day users of
U.S. Army Corps of Engineer reservoirs in Kansas and Missouri.  The first set
of models omitted substitute prices; the latter two sets included them.  An

""Economic Value of the Oil and Gas Resources on the Outer
Continental Shelf.""  Marine Resource Economics , 5(3):171-189.
A theoretical framework for estimating the economic value of the federal
government's offshore oil and gas resources is developed.  This framework is
then applied to geological and economic data generated by the Minerals
Management Service in support of their five-year leasing plan.  With an 8
percent real discount rate and a 1 percent real price growth rate, the
remaining economic rent as of 1987 on the reserves plus the undiscovered
offshore oil and gas resources is estimated at $118.6 billion (1987 dollars). 
The present value of the government's receipts from cash bonus and royalty
payments on these deposits is estimated at $37.2 billion.  Over 80 percent of
the remaining economic rent is derived from developed reserve deposits located
in the Gulf of Mexico.  The private sector has previously paid cash bonuses
for the leases located on those deposits and financed the installation of the
development platforms.  Because of this, the government will collect only a
small portion, approximately 22 percent, of the rent remaining on those
reserves.576Rothschild, Brian J. (1972).  ""An Exposition on the Definition of
Fishing Effort.""  Fishery Bulletin , 70(3):671-679.
The term ""fishing effort"" is well defined in population dynamics
literature.  The term as defined in the population dynamics literature is,
however, difficult to reconcile with broader definitions of fishing effort,
particularly those having economic implications.  The present paper discusses
the distinction between the definitions and gives some examples in the context
of allocating inputs, the capacities of fishing boats, and several stocks to
the catch in a manner that maximizes profits.  Managerial behavior is also an
important input to the fishing process; this is discussed in a decision theory
format where decision quality can be measured relative to entropy in the
decision environment affording a comparison among decision environments in
terms of information and an imputed valuation of a bit of information under
various circumstances.  The conventional measures of the quality of the
decision environment are often based upon expected catch.  Alternate measures
are discussed which include the expected loss or the risk involved in the
decision process.

In the last seven years, while the world population was climbing by
about 10 percent, the total landings of fish from the ocean declined by almost
as much, signaling, perhaps, the end of the long summer of human history when
the waters beneath the ocean surface seemed to hold an unending supply of fish
for food.  There is hope that improved knowledge of fish and ocean ecosystems,
more enlightened management, and more prudent allocations can once again
increase the yield .  It is certainly true that the science of fisheries has
much to learn, and that fisheries management, as practiced in most seafaring
nations, has more often focused on immediate interests than on what is
sustainable in the long haul.  The need to know more and manage better is
heightened by the environmental changes that have altered today s rivers and
coastlines, and by tomorrow s prospects of possible climate change. 
Technological and economic advances in aquaculture, worldwide a growing
industry, could also help, where these efforts directed more toward fish as a
dietary staple, as opposed to a luxury.

Roy, Noel (1998).   Fishing Behavior and the Length of the Fishing Season.  
Marine Resource Economics , 13(3):193-213.
The basic hypothesis of this paper is that the amount of fishing that a
fish harvester undertakes during a year is not determined entirely by
circumstances that are exogenous to the fisher, such as weather conditions and
resource availability, but is also partially a matter of individual choice. 
The paper develops a behavioral model of fishing from the perspective that the
decision to modify the period of time over which fishing takes place is
governed by a comparison of the marginal benefits and costs of doing so.  The
model is tested econometrically as an error-components model using a 10%
longitudinal sample of recipients of seasonal fishermen s unemployment
insurance benefits in Newfoundland over the period 1971-93.  The result
suggest that the Canadian unemployment insurance program has reduced the
length of the fishing season in Newfoundland by about 8-10 weeks.
Ruddle, Kenneth (1988).  ""Social Principles Under Traditional Inshore
Fishery Management Systems in the Pacific Basin.""  Marine Resource
Economics , 5:351-363.
Among fisheries management schemes, those based on sole ownership
concepts have been relatively little studied.  This concept has been most
widely applied in the traditional fisheries management or sea tenure systems
of the Pacific Basin, where unlike the West, sole ownership resides in the
community or other small social group.  Information on Pacific Basin sea
tenure systems remains largely anecdotal and unsynthesized.  In a partial
attempt to overcome that, this article defines and exemplifies six social
principles common to many traditional systems of sea tenure in inshore
fisheries management in the Pacific Basin, with reference to Oceanian islands,
and based on an examination of the literature and supplementary field
research.  These principles are that: (1) sea rights depend on social status,
(2) resource exploitation is governed by sue rights, 93) resource territories
are defined, (4) marine resources are controlled by traditional authorities,578(5) conservation was traditionally widely practiced, and (6) sanctions and
punishments are meted out for infringement of regulations.  Most remaining
systems are hybrids of traditional and modern components, with the latter
becoming dominant.  Interpretation of the literature without supplementary
field verification is severely constrained by the use of the "" anthropological
present"" tense.

Coase s contribution to understanding the role of government in the
economy is explained.  Coase showed that externalities may or may not require
a government solution, depending on the institutional setting of the problems
and the size of the transaction costs.  Moreover, even in the absence of
externalities, market transactions require low transaction costs.  Firms exit
to economize on those costs.  In shifting the terms of the debate, Coase
single-handedly moved economics from presuming specific roles for government
action to a more neutral position requiring detailed analysis to justify
government intervention.

""Finfish Catch Reduction in South Atlantic Shrimp Trawls Using

20.
Standard shrimp trawls used in the southeastern U.S. commercial fishery
were modified in an attempt to reduce the amount of unwanted fish (bycatch)
retained during normal shrimp trawling procedures.  A sampling design was used
to test the effectiveness of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) towed in
combination with unmodified nets in coastal waters off Brunswick, Georgia, in
1990.  Several problems hampered statistical analysis of the data, including
slight differences in the towing of port and starboard nets, onboard
modifications of BRDs during testing to correct design deficiencies, and
seasonality of shrimp catches in combination with large masses of sargassum
and jellyfish in trawls during fall sampling.  The modified Parrish turtle
excluder device (TED) was the only BRD that had a significant reduction (alpha
= 0.05) in the percent difference in total biomass compared to the control
net.  Bycatch reduction was not consistent for other designs.  No significant
loss of marketable sized fish was observed among the BRD designs compared to
control catches.  The ability of smallest juvenile fish to escape from BRDs,
thus shifting (increasing) the length-frequency distribution, was species
specific.  The normal Parrish TED was best suited for escapement of smallest
menhaden, while the diamond-mesh BRD with hoops best minimized capture of the
smallest Atlantic bumper, grey trout, and Atlantic croaker.  The square-mesh579net was most effective in reducing retention of smallest-sized thread herring,
and the modified Parrish TED retained less of the smallest-sized spot.  The
objective of 50% bycatch reduction with a shrimp loss of less than 5% was not
consistently reached; however, BRDs show promise for bycatch reduction in
South Atlantic coastal waters.

Institutional alternatives to common property externalities are wider
than argued by private exclusive property rights advocates.  The ""tragedy of

dominance of individual strategies.  The nonseparable common property
externality is an ""assurance problem.""  The assurance problem provides
striking perspectives in analytical and policy terms.  It redefines the

Institutional rules innovated by the group to reduce uncertainty and

in many forms, and private property is only one.

Political and economic theory make extensive use of the one period

generally.  While the PD provides important insights into the breakdowns of
social institutions, it gives no explanation of how or why institutions are

incentives to establish and maintain institutions that coordinate expectations
based on rules of fairmindedness.  With such coordinated expectations,
voluntary contributions to public goods may be utility maximizing strategies.

Methodology to analyze the propagation of errors in fishery model
parameters is described and demonstrated through its application to stock size
estimates obtained using Pope's cohort analysis.  The method requires that
independent standard errors for model parameters be available and its is based
upon a formal analysis of how uncertainties propagate through model
calculations.
In certain cases the methodology described can be used instead of a
numerical sensitivity analysis to investigate the model responses to error or
uncertainty in its parameters.  The ability to assess the relative merits of
increased precision in various parameter estimates is considered especially
useful.

This study attempts to identify plausible empirical relationships that
may be used to build predictive models of how climatic variability can cause
changes in certain population parameters, such as growth and mortality,
fecundity, post larval recruitment, age at maturity, etc.  Although
statistical tests for the effects of various interventions that take climatic
fluctuations into account are suggested, it is still not possible to
distinguish between efects due to brine disposal and those due to the Texas
closure since both were initiated in 1981.  The suggested test procedure can
be used to determine if the combined effects of the Texas closure and brine
disposal are statistically significant once variations in landings due to
climatic fluctuations have been taken into account.

the Threat of Entry: A Two-Stage Linear Game."" Journal of
Environmental Economics and Management , 16:121-133.
In this paper, we analyze harvesting policies for a producer who is
guaranteed exclusive harvesting rights to a renewable resource for a specified
period of time.  A second producer may enter the market after these rights
have expired and if entry occurs, the duopoly stage is modeled as a
noncooperative differential game.  We assume that the price and average costs
are constant and that the harvest rate is linearly dependent upon the stock
level and the effort expanded.  After the solution to the duopoly game is
presented, we give the solution to the two stage profit maximization problem
of the incumbent.  A modified most rapid approach path solution is shown to be
optimal under certain conditions.

Fish and Meat Products: Separability and Demographic Effects."" 
Presented at the International Conference on Fisheries Economics,
Os, Norway, May 26-28.
This paper focuses on the specification of the canadian household's
demand for fish and meat products.  In contrast to the demand literature, this
paper directly tests for separability and relevant substitutes by estimating
different demand systems over different aggregation levels for fish and meat
with an identical retail level household data set.  Knowledge of substitute
products obtained from separability tests will reveal the potential for
product differentiation.  The results indicate that all Canadian fish products
and species as categorized in this study cannot be modeled separately.  In
sum, analyzing the structure of meat or fish consumption at a relatively
aggregate level is correct based on these results.  However, different species
of fish and other seafood or different product forms of fish cannot be582analyzed separately.

Fish and Meat Products: Separability and Demographic Effects."" 
Marine Resource Economics , 12(1):37-55.
By reviewing the current demand literature for fish and meats, it is
apparent that several inadequacies arise from the problems of market
delineation or aggregation errors.  Inappropriate aggregation may lead to
biases in price elasticities and associated specification problems with
respect to identifying substitutes.  Formal separability tests allow for
identification of appropriate aggregation levels and the relevant products or
market boundaries in a systematic manner.  A formal demand system for fish and
meat can thus be estimated with one data set over various aggregations with
the appropriate demographic arguments.  The present article tests for
separability (and thus relevant substitutes/complements) by estimating
different demand systems over different aggregation levels for fish and meat
with an identical retail level household data set for the Canadian market.

The economic status of the Texas shrimp harvesting sector is analyzed
based on cost and revenue data for the period 1987-1992.  Texas ex-vessel
shrimp prices have remained low and stable while shrimp operating costs have
been increasing resulting in an annual loss averaging $3,875 per vessel. 
Second the bioeconomic impacts of sea turtle conservation policies on the
shrimp industry are analyzed using the General Bioeconomic Fisheries
Simulation Model (GBFSM) extended to include a Kemp s ridley sea turtle
biological submodel.  Results show that the sea turtle population will rebuild
without the use of TEDs at a lower cost to the nation.  Better nest protection
would be more effective in the long run than the TED regulations in restoring
the Kemp s ridley population.  Bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) were evaluated
and showed that costs to the nation increased as survival rates from shrimp
escapement declined.  If 50% survived, the total economic loss to society is
$44.9 million and if the survival is 0%, the loss is $65.7 million.

An analysis of the economic status of the Texas shrimp-harvesting sector
is provided.  The study begins by discussing how shrimp imports have affected
domestic shrimp supply and how this, in turn, has affected Texas ex-vessel
shrimp prices.  The impact of fishery conservation and management policies on
shrimp landings and returns is also.  Finally, an in-depth analysis of the
costs and returns of Texas shrimp fishermen is provided examined for the
period 1987 through 1992.  The results indicate that the Texas shrimp
harvesting sector was economically viable up to 1979 but that this viability
abruptly ended due to increased imports which have kept shrimp prices low and
stable and to increased costs resulting from the imposition of shrimp
regulatory policies.  In essence, the Texas shrimp-harvesting sector has been
experiencing a price-cost squeeze since the early 1980s.
Sample, Rebecca S. (1990).  ""Transition to Chaos in Multidimensional
Constrained Systems.""  Master of Science thesis, Department of583Physics, University of Maine, Orono, Me, May, 96 pp.
Chaotic behavior occurs in a variety of physical, chemical and
biological systems when a constraint is imposed on the total energy or mass of
the system.  In population models, for example, this constraint can reflect an
ecosystem's limited carrying capacity.  The focus of this research is the
onset of chaos in such systems, probed by simulating simple constrained
dynamical models.  The simulations track the time evolution of systems with
characteristic input, amplification and dissipation terms, analogous to
population models with birth, growth and mortality.  These model features are
chosen so that the system exhibits a stable steady-state solution in the
absence of the constraint.  When the constraint is implemented, we find that
the qualitative features of the transition from regular to the qualitative
features of the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics are extremely
sensitive to the model dimensionality, and differ greatly from the widely
studied period-doubling route to chaos exhibited by a large group of one
dimensional nonlinear systems.  In low dimensional cases, long periodic cycles
are prevalent, whereas higher dimensional systems show intermittency preceding
chaos.  Fourier transforms of time series have been used to identify
intermittent, quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes.  Eigenvalue analysis in the
vicinity of fixed solutions indicates that a wide range of biological inputs
that do not yield chaos in conventional population models do generate chaotic
dynamics once the carrying capacity is incorporated into the model. 
Characteristics of the onset of chaos observed in these models could be
relevant to other problems with similar types of constraints, such as
turbulence and multistep chemical reactions.

Variations in Anglers' Success Rates: An Application of the
Multiple-Site Travel Cost Method."" Marine Resource Economics ,
2(1):55-74.
An estimation method is presented to measure sport fishermen's valuation
of exogenous changes in fishing quality (catch rates).  A theoretical model is
initially presented to show how variations in prevailing catch rates influence
an angler's valuation of recreational fishing.  A two-stage estimation
approach is suggested that capitalizes on the notion that angler consumer
surplus is sensitive to changes in success rates.  The procedure entails first
estimating sportfishing values at qualitatively different fishing sites using
a multiple-site travel cost approach.  Afterward, the sensitivity of estimated
values to different success rate levels is measured using a separate
regression procedure.  An empirical application of this two-stage method to
Lake Michigan sportfishing is given.  It is estimated that for Lake Michigan
anglers who fish for trout and salmon, a 10% increase in success rates will
increase average trip values by $0.30.

and Open-Access Commercial Fisheries: A Theoretical Inquiry."" 
Bulletin of Marine Science , 37(1):305-317.
This paper explores the economic consequences of deploying fish
aggregating devices (FADs) in developed open access or common property
commercial fisheries.  The objective is to understand how FAD installation can
be expected to influence sustained gross revenues (sustained harvests),
employment and fishermen's profits over the long run.  A Mathematical
bioeconomic model is presented that illuminates the biological interdependence
between fishing that occurs at FAD locations and fishing that is directed at a
background fish stock.  Two models of biological interaction are considered. 
Model A assumes that high levels of FAD fishing effort will not reduce the584biological productivity of the underlying fish stock.  In Model B, this
assumption is relaxed.  Results of both models suggest that if harvesting
effort in the FAD fishery is unregulated, installation of FAD networks will
not generally increase fishermen';s aggregate profit position.  Furthermore,
depending on relative productivity and cost of effort in FAD and non-FAD
fishery, deployment of FADs may generate unintended results; decreases in
employment, harvest levels, and sustained gross revenues.  Potential problems
are especially acute when FAD fishing effort is low cost and efficient, and
FADs are effective at aggregating fish.  These findings point to the need for
managing levels of commercial fishing effort at FAD locations.  Limited entry
schemes, licensing and user fees are discussed as possible management options.
Sampson, David B. (1991).  ""Fishing Tactics and Fish Abundance, and
Their Influence on Catch Rates."" ICES J. Mar. Sci. , 48:291-301.
Choosing a location for fishing is the major short run decision made by
the skipper of a fishing vessel.  Because the spatial density of fish is not
uniform everywhere, where a skipper decides to fish largely determines the
size and value of his catch.  For that to be a rational decision, the skipper
must consider not only the catches he is likely to make at different locations
but also the costs incurred in fishing at those locations.  As a consequence
the catch rates and the catch per unit effort observed in a fishery depend not
just on fish stock abundance but also on economic factors such as wage rates
and fish and fuel prices.  This paper develops some simple theoretical models
for examining a fisherman's selection of fishing location.  The spatial
distribution of the fish stock is reduced to a single dimension, distance from
port, and it is assume d that fish density increases linearly with distance
from port and that the relative densities remain constant regardless of the
absolute level of fish stock abundance.  If a skipper operates his vessel
further from port, he gains access to greater densities of fish and higher
instantaneous catch rates but uses more fuel and time for travel.  A skipper
can maximize his share of the fishing profits by operating his vessel at a
particular distance from port.  The skipper operates within constraints that
determine the form of the revenue and cost functions.  Two models are
considered.  In the first, the duration of a fishing trip is considered by the
size of the fish hold or by some other limit to the amount of fish that can be
landed; each fishing trip continues until the hold is filled.  In this case
catch and revenue per trip are constant but the fishing costs vary nonlinearly
with distance from port.  Here the catch per unit effort is a nonlinear
function of the total biomass of the fish stock but the cpue is independent of
the price of fish.  In the second model, there is a time constraint: to fill
the hold would take too much time.  In this case each trip is of a fixed
duration and catch and revenue per trip are quadratic functions of distance
from port and operating costs vary linearly.  Here cpue is a linear function
of fish stock biomass and a nonlinear function of fish price.
Sampson, David B. (1992).  ""Fishing Technology and Fleet Dynamics:
Predictions from a Bioeconomic Model.""  Marine Resource Economics ,
7(1):37-58.
Bioeconomic models of fisheries usually do not provide details of
fishermen's short-run behavior.  This paper develops a model for the short-run
selection of fishing location by profit maximizing fisherman in an open access
fishery given that fish density increases further from port and given that
fishing trips have a fixed duration.  For any particular level of fish price
and fish stock abundance, a fishing vessel's technical characteristics (fuel
consumption, catch rate, vessel speed) and economic characteristics (wage
rates, fuel price) determine the optimum location for fishing.  A long run
model is derived; the cost flows for the fishing vessel and the biological585dynamics are added to the system.  The modes are applied to the evolution of a
hypothetical fishery in which fishermen utilize either an active fishing
technology trawlers) or a passive one (long-liners).
Sampson, David B. (1994).  ""Fishing Tactics in a Two-Species Fisheries
Model: The Bioeconomics of Bycatch and Discarding.""  Canadian
Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science , 51(12):2688-2694.
The selections for fishing location largely determine the species mix
and value of a fisher s catch.  Because of travel costs, these choices also
determine the profitability of a fishing trip.  This paper develops a simple
theoretical model for the selection of fishing locations by a fisher faced
with two co-occurring species whose densities vary with distance from port. 
For each species there can be different catchability coefficients, handling
times, and prices.  The duration of each fishing trip is assumed to be fixed. 
The model is used to determine the profit maximizing fishing tactics (the
fishing locations and time spent at each location) and to explore the
conditions that generate deliberate bycatch and discarding when one of the
species cannot be sold because it is unmarketable or because of trip limits.

A simple expression for finding and characterizing the optimal steady
state of a general dynamic optimization problem is derived.  This expression
is easy to interpret and easy to apply for various purposes as, for example,
to analytically investigate the effect of the discount rate upon optimal
steady state stock levels.  It is shown that an increase in the discount rate
may result in higher optimal stock levels even in the one-dimensional (single
species) case in nonlinear models.  An important result is that if demand is
inelastic at the optimal steady state, a higher discount rate will
unequivocally imply higher standing stock(s).  Increasing marginal cost of
harvest will further strengthen this result.  In the multidimensional case it
is demonstrated that an increased discount rate may result in higher optimal
stock levels for all stocks included in the model.586Sandal, Leif K. and Stein Ivar Steinshamn (1997).   A Stochastic Feedback
Model for Optimal Management of Renewable Resources.   Natural Resource
Modeling , 10(1):31-51.
Analytical expressions for optimal harvest of a renewable resource stock
which is subject to a stochastic process are found.  These expressions give
the optimal harvest as an explicit feedback control law.  All relations in the
model, including the stochastic process, may be arbitrary functions of the
state variable (stock).  The objective function, however, is at most a
quadratic function in the control variable (yield).  A quadratic objective
function includes the cases of downward sloping demand and increasing marginal
costs which are the most common sources for nonlinearities in the economic
part of the model.  When it is assumed that there is a moratorium on harvest
for stock sizes below a certain level (biological barrier), it is shown that
the barrier requirements influence the optimal harvest paths throughout.

This paper demonstrates that a fixed number of risk averse firms faced
with harvest uncertainty owing to resource stock uncertainty will typically
reduce their exploitation of a commons.  In addition, the total exploitation
of the industry will decrease when entry is permitted and uncertainty is
compared with certainty.  This result holds for perfectly competitive output
markets and also characterizes imperfectly competitive output markets with
linear market demand and risk neutral firms.  In the latter case, the socially
optimum number of firms is determined based upon the degree of uncertainty,
the price elasticity of market demand, and the elasticity of input
productivity.

of the fish resources.  The question of what is most beneficial to man
involves both biological and economic considerations.  In this paper some of
the effects of fishing on the fish stocks, and on the sustainable yields from
them, are considered, together with important economic factors.  It is
indicated that the maximum sustainable average catch and the maximum net
economic yield are mutually exclusive.  It is possible, however, to obtain
some net economic yield at the level of maximum sustainable harvest, but this
requires some modification of the common property nature of fish stocks.

direct approach are that it makes it unnecessary to make assumptions about an
appropriate reference point (such as average educational attainment in the
occupation), and that the analysis may be based on individual observations
rather than percentages.

Fisheries in the Southeastern United States: An Overview.""  Marine
Fisheries Review , 49(2):2-7.
Marine recreational fishing in the southeastern United States is an
outdoor recreational activity of increasing popularity, economic significance,
and consequence to the region's fishery resources.  In 1985, over 11 million
anglers made 44 million fishing trips in the south Atlantic and gulf and
caught 222 million fish.  Thirty-five percent were landed weighing over 131
million pounds, representing 40 percent of total edible finfish landings in
the region.  In 1985, the region accounted for 40 percent of all U.S.
saltwater anglers, 62 percent of all trips, and 50 percent of the total number
of recreationally caught fish.  Direct expenditures by south Atlantic and Gulf
anglers in 1985 were estimated to be nearly $3.4 billion.  These expenditures
are estimated to have generated an additional $1.5 billion in value added and
supported over 42,000 person-years of employment in marine recreational
fisheries related support and service industries.  Additional detailed
discussion of the nature and extent of marine recreational fishing in the
south Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands is
presented.

Solutions to bycatch problems will come from a strong industry-
government partnership that makes good use of the energies and skills of the
conservation and academic communities.  The proper role of government is not
to force bycatch regulations and systems on an already heavily burdened
industry.  Instead, it should be to provide planning support, sponsor and
coordinate research, disseminate bycatch data and other information, educate
the public on the real issues and progress being made, and perhaps most
important, listen to what the industry is saying.  Examples of what government
is doing are described.  The paper ends by describing, in general terms, what
has been learned so far about resolving bycatch problems.

North American agriculture has been characterized by many as a boom/bust
industry.  This paper focuses on a particular agricultural boom/bust cycle,
which began in the early 1970's in Saskatchewan Canada, a major wheat593producing region.  It is important to understand cycles because often the
wealth that they generate bears little or no relationship to Ricardian rent
which, in turn, makes the design of economic policy difficult.  Specifically,
the factors that give rise to boom/bust cycles and how they are related to
Ricardian rent are explored.  Wealth is distinguished from net farm income
and/or Ricardian rent.  Wealth multiplier effects are likely to far exceed
income effect multipliers during certain phases of the boom/bust cycle.  Other
effects of the boom/bust cycle phenomenon are discussed, including farm
diversification, farm size, rural communities, and farm debt.

Econometric Model of the Newfoundland Groundfishery.   Marine Resource
Economics , 3(3):237-263.
An econometric model is utilized to simulate the effects of a policy
change in which government financial assistance to a major Canadian marine
fishery is withdrawn and the industry is place on a commercially viable basis. 
Under near ideal conditions of marketing and harvesting, harvesting employment
would fall drastically, from approximately thirty thousand fishermen under the
current regime to approximately six thousand.  There would be a concomitant
fall in seasonal fish plant employment, and severe fall in those federal
transfer payments (e.g., unemployment insurance) that are currently generated
by extensive seasonal employment in both harvesting and processing sectors of
the fishery.
The policy analysis consists of simulations with a prototype econometric
model which integrates the demand, processing, and harvesting sectors of the
fishery.  The essential components of the 1,000-equation model are described.

In this paper the Crutchfield and Pontecorvo conjecture that a
monopsonistic processing sector would induce efficient use of a common
property resource is analyzed.  It is shown that if the harvesting sector
consists of a large number of firms with identical convex technologies, then
the conjecture is correct.  In addition, sufficient conditions are found under
which the stationary resource stock with a monopsonistic processing sector is
greater than the efficient size.

in the ordinary case there is little difference between the efficiency of
common and of private property.

observe the extra social costs and benefits accruing to other persons and

A survey of the economic literature of fisheries regulation shows that
little of analytical value for the comparison of alternative regulatory
techniques has emerged.  The suggestion that the general literature on
regulation, and on pubic choice, has something to contribute to the596understanding of alternative regimes produces eight criteria.  These are
applied to the choice between two systems of restricting entry: a tax and
quotas.  The transactions costs of the two systems are also investigated.  The
hypothesis is formed that the eight criteria, plus expected transactions
costs, give the edge to a quota system; but this is only illustrative of the
approach.

To what extent is the recently invented individual catch quota a form of
real property right? This article introduces six quantitative characteristics
of all personal interests in land and natural resources.  It is shown that
medieval fishing rights had some of these characteristics, but these rights
were not developed in the common law of property.  The article then turns to
modern regulatory licenses and catch quotas and examines the extent to which
they embody property characteristics.  In a digression, the obstacles to
political acceptance of the individual fishery property concept are surveyed. 
The paper concludes by suggesting that catch quotas may develop into shares in
the fish stock or biomass itself.

This paper uses some aspects of modern organization and management
theory to suggest what difficulties arise with the introduction of self
government in fisheries.  Recent studies are used to shed light on the
characteristics of fisheries that already have apparently successful schemes
of self government.  A simple question is asked: if for a fishery under
regulation it had already been decided, in principle, that self government
should be tried, which obstacles would be most serious?  Among the suggested
answers are deficient information, excessive numbers of fishermen and
fishermen heterogeneity.  The least serious of these are the distributional
problems.

and the Rate-Of-Return Regulated Firm.""  Land Economics ,
59(2):247-254.
The themes of lagged regulation and uncertainty are brought together in
this paper because existing studies of rate of return regulation and
uncertainty have focused predominately on demand or revenue uncertainty, while
input price uncertainty has been virtually ignored.Rapid changes in input
prices have brought the issue of regulatory lag to the forefront.  This and
the regulatory commissions response of moving toward continuous regulation597raises the issue of how will the combination of input price uncertainty and
continuous rate of return regulation affect the firms's section of inputs. 
Using a capital asset pricing model, the authors find that the continuously
regulated firm has the incentive to use relatively less capital than when
input prices are known with certainty.

Aerial sampling surveys of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico were conducted

square kilometer study area was completed to allow estimation of the regional
abundance of bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops  truncatus ).  Under the assumption
of no net movement between sampling regions and sampling periods it was
estimated on average between 35,000 and 45,000 bottlenose dolphins may live in
U.S. Gulf of Mexico waters of depths 183 m or less.  The dominant proportion
of these animals appear to inhabit waters of greater than 18.3 m.  The data
were stratified to allow estimates sufficient for quota recommendations for
managing the live capture fishery for bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of
Mexico.

usually arising from designed experiments are treated very briefly, as just
special cases of unbalanced data.  Emphasis on unbalanced data is the backbone
of the book, designed to assist those whose data cannot satisfy the strictures

This paper analyzes alternative policies for controlling stochastic
externalities, considering both the incentive and the risk sharing effects of
each.  When polluter actions are unobservable so that regulation is not
possible, alternative liability rules including zero, partial, and full
liability are compared.  When actions are observable, then regulation is
possible, and the use of regulation is compared to the use of liability.  The
principle agent paradigm provides the analytical approach used to determine
the efficient policy choice.  The effect of the availability of insurance is
also addressed.  This paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of
the analysis for the control of stochastic marine pollution.

The problem of extracting commonly owned renewable resources is examined
within an evolutionary-game-theoretic framework.  It is shown that cooperative
behavior guided by norms of restraint and punishment may be stable in a well
defined sense against invasion by narrowly self interested behavior.  The
resource stock dynamics are integrated with the evolutionary-game dynamics. 
Effects of changes in prices, technology, and social cohesion on extraction
behavior and the long run stock are analyzed.  When threshold values of the
parameters are crossed, social norms can break down leading generally to the
lowering of the long run stock, and possibly to its extinction.

negative Integers, Truncation, and Endogenous Stratification."" 
Journal of Econometrics , 37:211-223.
This paper corrects an estimation problem that has not yet been
recognized in previous estimates of demand functions using on site samples. 
There are three kinds of problems that one faces in on site samples, namely,
non-negative integers, truncation, and endogenous stratification.  Two
theoretically correct maximum likelihood methods are developed based on two
different assumptions about the variable distribution: the normal distribution
and the Poisson distribution.  A simulation is performed to compare the two
methods using generated data sets of known models.  We should not use OLS and
instead should use the maximum likelihood methods developed here to estimate
demand functions that use on site samples.  If forecasting is the purpose of
estimation, then the simulation indicates that the Poisson ML method may be
better.

the Western Gulf of Mexico."" Marine Fisheries Review , 49(1):14-19.
Seasonal movement patterns of marked brown shrimp and pink shrimp
relative to the U.S.-Mexico boarder in the western Gulf of Mexico are
described from recaptures of shrimp tagged during 1978-1980.  The intent was
to determine the degree to which coastal shrimp movements would affect
commercial catches after implementation of new fishing regulations off Texas
and Mexico.  Shrimp were collected by trawl, marked with polyethylene streamer
tags, and released during March-November at sites between Galveston, Texas,
and Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico.  Movements were examined by vector analysis
and by recaptures per unit commercial landings.  Over 121,500 shrimp were
marked during seven releases in estuaries of which 1,827 (1.5 percent) were
recaptured.  Only 72 brown shrimp and 126 pink shrimp were recaptured602offshore, but southerly movement patterns were indicated after five of those
seven releases.  Offshore releases of 71,485 brown shrimp and 19,185 pink
shrimp resulted in 12.4 percent and 19.7 percent recapture proportions,
respectively.  Tagged brown shrimp moved up to 620 km from release sites and
remained free up to 430 days.  Tagged pink shrimp moved a maximum 428 km and
were free up to 446 days.  Recaptures were higher south of release sites after
20 of 30 releases of brown shrimp off Texas and Tamaulipas.  In contrast,
recaptures of pink shrimp were higher south of release sites after only 7 of
13 releases.  The effectiveness of the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery
management plan, enacted in 1981 to increase brown shrimp yield by seasonal
prohibition of fishing could be diminished by the tendency for brown shrimp to
migrate south.

Market equilibrium dynamics of herd inventory management are derived for
homogenous female populations.  Short run supply is backward bending in
response to permanent changes in demand and is rising in response to
transitory changes in demand.  Increasing inventories are associated with high
and falling prices and decreasing inventories with low and rising prices, but
there is no market instability in this.  These unusual intertemporal
substitution effects follow from both rational expectations and appropriately
formulated cobweb models and go part of the way toward explaining hog and
cattle inventory cycles.

This report describes recent developments in the demand for groundfish
in the U.S.  It begins with a review of general trends in U.S. food
consumption and their implications for groundfish.  Groundfish consumption
data is presented, along with a discussion of its determining factors.  U.S.
market channels for cod in particular are described, and supply factors are
assessed for their impact on consumption.  Efforts to date to model groundfish
markets are described, and their conclusions and limitations discussed.  Among603the report s conclusions are that seafood demand continues to rise in the face
of rising prices, and that the highly concentrated U.S. cod market is shifting
over to the more available and cheaper pollock.  While existing models need
some revisions to accurately reflect developments since 1988, they provide
useful guidance about the responsiveness of the U.S. market to changes in
prices and supply levels of some species and product forms.

""Allocatable Fixed Inputs and Jointness in Agricultural
Production: Implications for Economic Modeling.""  American Journal
of Agricultural Economics , 66(1):72-78.
Allocatable fixed inputs, such as land, are a potentially important
source of jointness in agriculture.  As with other causes of jointness, they
necessitate multiple product systems for modeling product supply and input
demand.  In other important ways, however, their analytical implications are
very different from other causes of jointness.  Model specification differs. 
Demand functions for the quantities of each input used in the production of
individual commodities can be derived if a primal approach is used, but such
allocation equations cannot in general be identified from a dual
specification.  Available allocation data are not even useful in such dual
estimations.

The findings of a workshop that described the groundfish management
activities in the Scotia-Fundy Region from 1977 to 1993 are presented.  The
workshop objectives were to (1) identify the degree to which the management
objectives for this part of the Atlantic Canada fishery were met since the
extension of jurisdiction in 1977 and (2) to the degree that they have not
been met, identify the causes that prevented successful attainment of the
objectives.  The primary objective of stock conservation was to be obtained
using F 0.1 single species quota management.  The inability to meet the
conservation objectives, in part due to short term trade offs in support of
economic and social objectives, has in the longer term undermined the
sustainability of the commercial fishery and the fishing community.
Sinclair, William F. (1978).  ""Management Alternatives and Strategic
Planning for Canada's Fisheries.""  J. Fish. Res. board Can. ,
35:1017-1030.
The evils of operating Canada's commercial and recreational fisheries605under open access conditions were known before Confederation.  Early
recognition of these ills did not lead to an understanding of the basic
problems nor to long-term solutions.  In the early 1950's the first economic
model was developed that articulated the underlying causes of excess capacity
and the tendency of overexploitation in open access fisheries.  This was
followed by a number of studies that explored the relationship between the
biological reproductive capacity of a fishery and the economic consequences of
managing publicly owned resources under open access conditions.  This early
work provides a general framework from which a number of fisheries management
alternatives emerge.  Each of six management alternatives, that are implicit
in policy for Canada's commercial fisheries, are assessed in terms of
political acceptability, administrative feasibility, and effectiveness.  It is
emphasized that the responsibility of a government fisheries agency is to
manage fisheries resources in the best interest of the owners of the resource
- the nation's taxpayers.  A properly implemented license control system would
dissipate, rather than perpetuate, social and economic hardship among
fishermen.  This misplaced concern for unproven social problems often leads
fisheries managers to support programs that sacrifice all the benefits that
could be generated from the resource and the resource itself.  A management
scheme is recommended that encompasses a simple licensing system, a tax or a
royalty on catch, and a limited variation of the ""Grandfather System.""  The
combination of these three incorporates the main advantages of most management
alternatives while avoiding most of their main shortcomings.  A carefully
implemented program that accounts for economic and biological considerations
would improve the efficiency of the industry, improve fishermen's incomes,
minimize social disruptions, help to instill an environmental conscience,
protect the resource, and induce less, rather than more, government
intervention into the free operation of the fishing industry.  Probably more
important, the program would generate an economic return for the people of
Canada.

Sissenwine, Michael (1984).  ""The Uncertain Environment of Fishery606Scientists and Managers.""  Marine Resource Economics , 1(1):1-30.
Traditionally, single species deterministic models have been used to
describe the interaction between fish populations and fish harvesters. 
Management theory and practice often assume that decisions are made based on
exact knowledge of the fishery system (i.e., population size, fishing effort,
recruitment, and so on, predicted or measured without error).  Unfortunately,
traditional approaches of fishery science and management ignore a major aspect
of fishery systems-uncertainty.  Biological productivity of most fishery
resources is primarily dependent on recruitment.  Recruitment varies by an
order of magnitude or more, with little apparent relationship to spawning
stock size except at extremely reduced levels.  For practical purposes,
production of fish populations is stochastic, not deterministic.  Furthermore,
growth and natural mortality parameters, that are usually assumed constant
when analyzing individual populations, actually vary as a result of population
interactions.  In addition, the contagious and dynamic spatial distribution of
most fish populations contributes still more uncertainty.  Some of the
variability in recruitment can be accounted for by prerecruit surveys and
correlations with environmental factors.  Multispecies models that attempt to
account for the predation effect on natural mortality are now available. 
There are robust fishery management methods that are less dependent on precise
and real time estimation of population size.

The Era of Fixed Quota in Perpetuity.""  Fishery Bulletin ,
90(1):147-60.
ITQ management was implemented in New Zealand to address overfishing,
overcapitalization, and excess government regulation.  Quotas were based on
catch histories, with a quota ""buyback"" and prorated cuts to achieve total
allowable catch (TAC) levels indicated by preliminary stock assessments. 
Fixed amounts of quota were issued in perpetuity.  Annual stock assessments
are conducted.  Government stated that it would buy or sell quota at market
determined prices to adjust TACs.  On 1 April 1990, ITQs were redefined as 
proportions of annual TACs.  Government extracts resource rent.  To data,
there is little evidence of improvement in the biological or economic
condition of the fisheries resources.  Although there is general support for
ITQ management in New Zealand, many problems have been encountered: quota
overruns resulting from bycatch; inadequate stock assessment capability;
disagreement over the level of resource rentals; and failure of government to
enter the marketplace to reduce TACs when necessary.

This paper examines interaction in the absence of property rights when
agents face a trade-off between productive and coercive activities.  In this
setting, conflict is not the necessary outcome of one-time interaction, and
cooperation is consistent with domination of one agent over another.  Other
things being equal, an agent's power, a well-define concept in this paper, is
inversely related to an agent's resources when resources are valued according
to marginal productivity theory.  Some implications for the evolution of
property rights are drawn.  The model is applicable to a variety of situations
in which directly unproductive activities are prevalent.

This paper attempts to reconcile the theoretical predictions of
increasing real prices for nonrenewable natural resource commodities obtained
from Hotelling style models with the empirical findings of falling prices for
these commodities.  A theoretical model for relative price movements is
derived for the case of exogenous technical change and endogenous change in
the grade of ores mined.  The model suggests a U-shaped time path for relative
prices.  The implied price movements are tested for all the major metals and
fuels and the model parameters are found to be statistically significant for
11 out of the 12 commodities tested.

The paper finds that constant royalty rates can be neutral or can lead
unambiguously to conservation or to rapid exploitation only when the
processing technology is particularly simple (a modified Cobb-Douglas
production function).  In addition, except for very simple processing
technologies, time varying royalty rates cannot be monotonic if they are to
achieve neutrality; they must sometimes rise and sometimes fall.
Slade, Margaret E. (1984).  ""Tax Policy and the Supply of Exhaustible
Resources: Theory and Practice.""  Land Economics , 60(2):133-147.
Unregulated extraction patterns may not be optimal if social and private
discount rates differ or if extraction creates an externality.  The difficulty
of designing tax policy that achieves a particular objective is illustrated by
the fact that a tax levied in any time period can have repercussions in all
future time periods and, if it is anticipated, it can affect past extraction. 
A general model for assessing the effects of taxation on resource extraction
is developed.  The undistorted (no-tax) and distorted paths are compared to
determine the direction and magnitude of tax effects.  It is found that the
change in extraction paths resulting from a particular tax depends on where it
falls, on how it affects input and output prices, and on the ease of
substituting between the resource and other inputs in processing.

Techniques of fish population dynamics, model building, and optimal

fishery in South Australia that involves the annual exploitation of a single608year class of prawns.  A model of the fishery is constructed that is then
subjected to optimization techniques to derive optimal management strategies. 
Dynamic programming is used to derive optimal fishery closures for a given
number of vessels.  The derived controls take into account the major source of
variation (variable recruitment).  Their sensitivity to the uncertain
parameters and to possible changes in costs is also considered, and the best
number of vessels is determined taking into account parameter uncertainty,
expected total profits, returns to capital, and the statistical distribution
of returns.

This paper reports on the on-going attempt to assess fishing capacity
and fishing effort for a range of years on the basis of common definitions. 
An aggregate effort measurement for a specific fleet is developed, taking into
account capacity of the fleet and the number of days at sea.  In this
measurement, the changes in the size and composition of the fleet over time is
measured using engine power, by weighting the engine power of vessels of
different sizes according to their economic productivity.  Then, to find a
relationship between fishing effort and productive output, using landings by
species is not enough because catchability of the species varies over a wide
range.  Instead quantities of landings are weighted by using average prices. 
Thus, output is then a function of fishing effort and the availability of fish
stocks.

the local quality of education and local taxes.  In addition subgroup analysis
allows the comparison of the estimated shadow prices for two different income

Law of the Sea negotiations and The Fishery Conservation and Management
Act of 1976 create new options for fisheries management.  Historical analysis
of two major management programs in the United States of America, columbia
River chinook salmon and Pacific halibut, shows two unresolved management
problems.  One is the innovativeness of fishermen in seeking ways to improve
their harvests.  The other is changing social priorities that are largely
unpredictable and outside the control of fisheries managers.  A method for609analysis of patterning associated with management goals is illustrated.  Since
the general management goals are harvest improvement and more predictability,
measures are used that show the adequacy of fit and reduction in variability
between actual and predicted management outcomes.

report, Department of Anthropology, Oregon State University,

Rockville, MD 20852, Feb.
Fishermen are viewed as organisms that have an evolutionary pattern and
life cycle.  The typical evolutionary pattern is development of technologies
to substitute cultured stocks for natural ones.  The life cycle process is one
of declining commercial opportunities as productivity increases require more
stringent management measures.  Angling and aesthetic uses increase during
this process.  To adjust to life cycle and evolutionary patterns separate
conservation from management decisions, adopt an ecosystem focus for
conservation measures, promote nonfishing opportunities, and keep expectations
reasonable.
Smith, Courtland L. and Susan S. Hanna (1990).  ""Measuring Fleet
Capacity and Capacity Utilization.""  Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. ,
47:2085-2091.
Fishing capacity measures the capability to catch fish.  Capacity
utilization is the actual effectiveness in catching fish; the ratio of catch
to capacity.  The factors comprising a fleet s capacity are the number and
size of vessels, the technical efficiency of those vessels, and the time
commitment of fishermen.  Knowing the capacity utilization of a fleet is
critical for evaluating management alternatives.  This is true regardless of
whether fisheries are managed with fleet controls or with with individual
controls.  We illustrate the measurement of capacity utilization with the
Oregon bottom trawl fishery, in which fleet capacity quadrupled between 1976
and 1982.  From 1982 to 1985, capacity declined 30 percent due to economic
problems in the industry and vessels finding better opportunities elsewhere. 
Capacity measurement is necessary to assess management induced changes in
controlled fisheries.  Controlling capacity requires addressing all the
elements associated with capacity growth.  Examination of the components of
fleet capacity reveals an array of management options.

Two behavior patterns of fishermen, specialist and generalist, are
evaluated as ways of coping with market and natural variability.  Changes in
these behaviors predicted by an analytical model are evaluated against data
from several fisheries.  The predictions and the data suggest that a mix of
specialist and generalist fishing behavior is a way of coping with
unpredictability.  Management usually regards fishing behavior as homogeneous;
as a result, many management rules discriminate against one type of behavior
or the other.

This paper examines issues in the management of replenishable resources
under uncertainty.  The stochastic resource dynamics are given by the discrete
time counterpart of the classic logistic growth model.  The use of discrete
time stochastic dynamics allows for a more general characterization of growth
uncertainty than is possible with continuous time models.
Given a general specification of the resource management problem,
necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal management policy are
derived.  Many important properties of the management policy are derived and
comparisons are made with the deterministic counterpart policy.  An example
serves to illustrate many of the results of the analysis.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the generalization of

shown that within a diffusion framework, the optimal steady state management
policy is equivalent to a management policy that is optimal outside the

link between steady state optimal management policies in the deterministic
resource economics and biology literatures and the quickly developing
stochastic resource literature.

This paper examines traditional approaches to modeling production

respect to desired properties and restrictions.  A new notion of equilibrium
production functions is introduced in which explicit account is taken of the
recognized interdependence of firms involved in extraction.  The results are
quite encouraging.  In particular, the resultant model of production has the
ex ante desired technical, externality, mass balance aggregation, and
heterogeneity properties.  As well, it provides useful insights for empirical
research.  Finally, this new approach with its explicit recognition of the
interdependence of firms has the potential for providing new directions into
the analysis of industry equilibrium and regulation of resource industries.

Politics and Power in the Regulation of Florida's Marine
Resources.""  Social Problems , 40 (1):?-?.
This paper draws on interviews with 70 couples in commercial fishing
families to examine the relative influence of objective scientific information
as opposed to political and social considerations on the management and
allocation of marine resources.  Decisions about the regulation of commercial
fishing are influenced by Florida's economic dependence on tourism and related
development and competition for control of the state's coastal resources. 
Class, power, and bureaucratic knowledge all have a part in the decisions that
shape the regulation of Florida's inshore net fishing industry.

Perspective.   In Solving Bycatch, Considerations for Today and
Tomorrow , Alaskan Sea Grant College Program Report No. 96-03, University
of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska, 322 pp.
Because most fishing gear is completely selective, fishing operations
result in the incidental catch of species not targeted.  This incidental
catch, or bycatch, can occur in two contexts: (1) in a mix species or
multispecies fishery where the species caught are managed as a unit or by a
single management agency, or (2) in fisheries where the bycatch of species
regulated by a different management entity must be minimized.  From an
economic perspective, the first kind of bycatch can be dealt with using
traditional management tools.  Regulating the second kind of bycatch, however,
creates additional costs.  The  bycatch  fishery experiences control costs -
foregone revenue from the loss of target species that might have been taken,
and in addition, the increased operational cost associated with avoiding
bycatch.  The  other  fishery experiences impact cost - foregone revenue
because the bycatch fishery reduced the potential yield form the fishery. 
This second class of bycatch control problem is common and exists, for
example, in the groundfish fisheries off Alaska, where the bycatch of halibut,
red king crab, Tanner crab, herring, and salmon is limited.  It also exists in
the gillnet fisheries for groundfish off New England, where time/area closures
limit target catch to reduce harbor porpoise bycatch mortality.  Controlling
bycatch is thus another allocation issue and amenable to cost/benefit
analysis.  An examination of current bycatch management systems in the Alaskan
groundfish fisheries and the northeast groundfish gillnet fisheries illustrate612considerable differences between control and impact costs.

Recreation: A Problem of Non-Nested Hypotheses.""  Land Economics ,
51(2):103-111.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which the
traditional specifications of the travel cost demand equations would be
acceptable models for wilderness recreation for one case study - the
Desolation Wilderness Area in Northern California.  Several specifications of
travel cost models are examined and a recent test for non-nested hypotheses is
used to discriminate between them.  Overall the findings suggest that while
travel cost equations can readily be estimated and by conventional criteria
they might be considered fully acceptable, it is not clear that they should be
accepted as reflecting adequately the character of the demand for wilderness
recreation.
Smith, V. Kerry (1977).  ""Control Theory Applied to Natural and
Environmental Resources, An Exposition.""  Journal of Environmental
Economics and Management , 4:1-24.
Four control theory models of natural and environmental resource use,
drawn from the existing literature, are developed in a manner to emphasize
their technical and decentralized interpretive similarity.  Renewable,
nonrenewable, and amenity resource use are treated as closely related problems
of optimal (biological, earth material, ecological, or environmental) capital
allocation over time.  Thus nonrenewable resources, and the problem of
exhaustion, are just limiting (zero growth) cases of renewable resources, and
the problem of species extinction.  Just as exhaustion can be optimal,
extinction can be optimal.  Waste recycling is treated as part of the problem
of optimal regeneration of ""clean"" environmental capital; wilderness use as a
problem of managing the regeneration of ecological capital.

Smith, V. Kerry (1979).  Scarcity and Growth Reconsidered . Resources for
the Future, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.
This volume is based on a conference that investigated resource
scarcity.  The objective is to report on an effort to reconsider the long run
importance and availability of natural resources for economic growth and
material well being.  The forum was organized around three broad aspects of
scarcity and growth: (1) the role of natural resources in economic modeling;
(2) the nature of the physical constraints on the availability of natural
resources; and (3) the ability of empirical methods to gauge the potential for
stringencies in our natural resource endowments.613Smith, V. Kerry (1980).  ""The Evaluation of Natural Resource Adequacy:
Elusive Quest or Frontier of Economic Analysis.""  Land Economics ,
56(3):257-298.
This paper addresses how well analysts have dealt with evaluating the
adequacy of our natural resources.  To do so, we consider the most influential
analyses of resource scarcity, developing their intellectual roots and
detailing the methods they used.  With this background, together with some
perspective on the current empirical analyses of the extent to which the
United States has experienced increased scarcity of natural resources, we
examine the theory underlying the measurement of scarcity indexes and the
mechanisms through which natural resource constraints might be relaxed.  Our
appraisal of this work is closed with direct consideration of the relationship
between meeting environmental quality goals and natural resource needs, as
well as with a review of the implications of this evaluation for further
research.
Smith, V. Kerry (1988).  ""Selection and Recreational Demand.""  American
Journal of Agricultural Economics , 70(1):29-36.
This article compares five methods for estimating travel cost recreation
demand models with micro data.  The models are distinguished by their
treatment of selection effects that arise with on-site surveys.  The
comparison considers adjusting for selection effects in a variety of ways,
including single and double selection rule models.  Both parameter and
consumer surplus estimates were evaluated.  The findings indicate that the
treatment of selection effects alone was not important for this case. 
However, the choice of an estimator did lead to large variations in per trip
consumer surplus estimates.
Smith, V. Kerry (1990).  ""Estimating Recreation Demand Using the
Properties of the Implied Consumer Surplus.""  Land Economics ,
66(2):111-120.
Bockstael and Strand (1987) judged the methods for estimating demand or
random utility models based on the properties of their respective consumer
surplus estimates.  This paper proposes to define estimators based on the
properties of their implied consumer surplus estimates.  This type of argument
is not new and usually is associated with the rationale offered for Bayesian
estimators.  However, the motivation for the estimator proposed here can be
based on minimizing the mean squared error of the consumer surplus estimates. 
Moreover, it can be constructed from the statistics usually reported with
ordinary least squares estimates.

This paper reviews research on nonmarket valuation.  It seeks to gauge
whether the methods are up to the tasks demanded of them and to identify new
research priorities.  The evaluation suggests that we can outline a protocol
for implementing and using the methods with some resources, while for other
resources our experience is still developing.  Because the demands for
valuation information are increasing as fast as our understanding of
measurement methods is advancing, the next step in development requires
defining a systematic  commodity structure  for environmental services with
the needs for valuation measures providing conceptual underpinnings.
Smith, V. Kerry (1993).  ""Welfare Effects, Omitted Variables, and the

This paper offers an economic interpretation of Kling s (1989) finding
that single price change measures of consumer surplus will provide an unbiased
measure for a multiple price change, provided the prices are perfectly
correlated.  The explanation lies in recognizing that correlation in this case
serves to define the commodity extent-of-the-market.  Using this link, the
paper demonstrates how the insights involved in defining general equilibrium
demand functions or equivalently residual demand models can be adapted to fit
the issues raised with travel cost models in accounting for the effects of
substitutes.

Model: A View from the Trenches.""  Land Economics , 63(2):179-192.
The hedonic travel cost framework recognizes that individuals' decisions
to visit recreation sites can be used to estimate implicit prices for the
characteristics of these sites.  Moreover, with these prices and individuals'
consumption choices, the demands for characteristics can also be recovered. 
However, the actual process of implementing the model requires a substantial
amount of information on households' recreation decisions as well as some
detailed models.
Smith, V. Kerry and Raymond J. Kopp (1980).  ""The Spatial Limits of the
Travel Cost Recreational Demand Model.""  Land Economics , 56(1):64-
72.
This article describes a method for judging the spatial limits of travel
cost recreational demand models as they are conventionally applied to
secondary data sets.  The spatial limits result from the assumptions necessary
to use the available secondary data to estimate the representative
individual's demand for a given recreational site's services including (a) the
objective of the trip to the recreational site; (b) the amount of time spent
on the site during each trip, and (c) the mode of travel and corresponding
travel costs required to reach the site.  A statistical test for the stability
of the estimated demand functions' parameters provides an empirical basis for
determining the extent to which the required assumptions are consistent with
given samples.  Further it is possible to adjust the composition of the sample
of origin zones used in deriving final demand estimates to reflect these
bounds.615Smith, V. Kerry, William H. Desvousges, and Matthew P. McGivney (1983).

Smith, V.L. (1968).  ""Economics of Production from Natural Resources."" 
American Economic Review  58: 409-431.
This paper attempts to provide a unified theory of production from
natural resources.  A single model of an industry is used to describe a
dynamic process of recovery from such technologically diverse resources as
fish, timber, petroleum, and minerals.  Recovery for each of these resources
is seen as a special case of a general model depending upon whether the
resource is replenishable, and on whether production exhibits significant
externalities.  A model of centralized management, with particular reference
to common property resources, such as fisheries under stationary conditions is
also discussed and compared with competitive recovery in the stationary state.
Smith, V.L. (1969).  ""On Models of Commercial Fishing."" Journal of
Political Economy  77: 181-198.
The model provides one example of a descriptive theory that transforms
any specific pattern of assumptions about cost conditions, demand
externalities, and biomass growth technology into a pattern (conceivably
observable) of exploitation.  The model or variations on it would appear to
have much wider possible applications, such as (1) a theory of bionomic
equilibrium in primitive hunter cultures and (2) possibly the rudiments of an
economic theory of species extinction, both historical and modern.

Closures in Australia s Multispecies Northern Prawn Fishery.   Draft
report submitted to the North American Journal of Fisheries Management .
In Australia s northern prawn fishery, seasonal closures are used to
manage the size composition of the commercial catch.  While primarily aimed at
short term economic benefits of improved yield per recruit, they are also used
to help reduce the risk of recruitment over fishing.  Until recent years,
seasonal closures took the form of a single closed season in late summer to
protect juvenile banana prawns ( Penaeus  merguiensis ) during months of peak
recruitment.  However, with the growing commercial importance of tiger prawns,
(P. esculentus  and P. semisulcatus ) and concern for their recruitment over
fishing, a second mid year closure was introduced to protect subadult tiger
prawns until their main spawning season, which begins in August.  In this
paper, we use a simulation model of the northern prawn fishery to assess the
biological and economic effectiveness of seasonal closures, specifically in
yield, income, net operating income, and spawning stock indices.  Because
there is no reliable spawning stock recruitment relationship, recruitment was
assumed to be constant; thus analysis was effectively per recruit.  Our base
model, with closures between 1 December and 1 April and between 25 June and 1
August, closely resembles the current seasonal closure regime in the fishery. 
Using this model, net operating income was found to increase by 3.7% with a
single closed season between 28 November and 14 April, but tiger prawn
spawning indices reduced by an average of 5.6%.  A single closed season
between 13 December and 8 May retained the same protection on subadult tiger
prawns as the base model, but increased the net income by 2.3%.  Net operating
income was relatively insensitive to closure dates; any opening date between
17 March and 2 June would result in net operating income within 5% of the
maximum.

Japan is by far the world s largest importer and consumer of sea urchin
roe.  The United States has become the largest supplier of sea urchins and sea620urchin roe to Japan.  Most fresh sea urchin roe are sold through auction at
the Tokyo Central Wholesale Market.  The tariff for sea urchin roe is higher
than rates for most other seafood products imported into Japan and the tariff
for U.S. exports is higher than the rate imposed on other major suppliers. 
The future market of U.S. sea urchins in Japan depends to a large extent on
Japanese sea urchin harvests.  Because sea urchin stocks appear to be
declining, and domestic harvest is not likely to increase in the short term,
increased export of U.S. sea urchins and their roe has significant potential
especially if tariff rates can be reduced.

The proposed action will result in management of the billfish fishery in
the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico,
Caribbean, Mid-Atlantic, and New England Councils.  The species regulated are
the sailfish, Istiophorus  platypterus ; the white marlin, Tetrapturus  albidus ;
the blue marlin, Makaira  nigricans , and the longbill spearfish, Tetrapturus
pfluegeri .  The objectives are to : 1) maintain the highest availability of
billfishes to the U.S. recreational fishery; 2) optimize the social and
economic benefits to the nation by reserving the billfish resource for its
traditional use which on the continental U.S. is almost entirely a
recreational fishery.  In the Caribbean, the fishery is both a recreational
and small scale handline fishery where billfishes are used as food; 3)
increase understanding of the condition of the billfish stocks and the bill
fish fishery.  Optimum yield for billfishes is the greatest number of billfish
that can be caught by the recreational fishery in the EEZ, consistent with the
provisions of this fishery management plan, considering the biological
limitations of the stock and the unavoidable incidental catches in other

Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Swordfish.""  Draft, 1
Southpark Circle, Suite 306, Charleston, South Carolina, December.
The fishery management plan (FMP) for Atlantic swordfish was approved on
August 22, 1985.  The FMP contained measures designed to cap the harvest of
fish less than 50 pounds dressed weight at the 1980 level by implementing
time/area closures (Variable Season Closures [VSC]).  The closures were never
implemented and on December 31, 1987 the VSC provision expired.  Currently,
the FMP contains only data collection provisions.  This amendment will
implement management measures designed to rebuild the spawning stock to a
level that will reduce the likelihood of recruitment failure.

Southeast Fisheries Science Center (1995).  ""1995 Shark Evaluation
Annual Report.""  National Marine Fisheries Service, 75 Virginia
Beach Drive, Miami, Florida, April, 23 pp.
This report was prepared in support of the Atlantic Shark Fishery
Management Plan.  The information presented herein represents an update to the
information presented in the Report of the Shark Evaluation Workshop held at
the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Miami Laboratory, 15-18 March 1994. 
The 1994 Workshop Committee, which focused on the large coastal shark
grouping, found that for many species considered, shark abundance in waters
off the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts is depressed due to fishing
removals.  The available catch rate information indicated that the abundance
of many of the species and species groups could have declined by about 50 to
75% from the early 1970's to the mid 1980's.  Results of the current analysis
using updated and new information are similar.  The Workshop Committee
concluded that recovery of this resource to levels of the 1970's will be slow
(perhaps 30 years or more in some cases), due to the relatively low intrinsic
rates of increase exhibited by most shark species.  The Workshop Committee
also concluded that measuring recovery or decline under a TAC implemented in
1993, even with precise abundance indices, may not be possible for a decade or
more.  The additional information available for the 1995 evaluation is
consistent with this conclusion.  The present report provides updated catch
and catch rate information.  The report also provides a summary of management
actions undertaken during the intervening year since the Workshop Committee
met.
The 1994 Workshop committee concluded that the greatest impediments to
improving shark stock assessments continue to be the general lack of species
and size specific catch (landed and discarded) and effort data, as well as627only limited fishery independent measures of shark abundance and productivity. 
While notable improvements in species specific catch information has been made
for a portion of the recent catches through observer data collections,
improved assessment advise will only result if these efforts are increased and
maintained for a reasonably long time period.  In addition, improvements in
fishery independent measures of species specific abundance are still required.
Southeast Fisheries Science Center (1996).  ""1996 Report of the Shark
Evaluation Workshop.""  National Marine Fisheries Service, 75
Virginia Beach Drive, Miami, Florida, June, 80 pp.
The available data indicate that the catch rates of many of the species
and species groups have declined by 50 to 75% from the early 1970's to the mid
1980's.  The most recent data indicate that the rapid rate of decline that
characterized the stocks in the mid 1980's has slowed significantly. 
Abundance estimates from the more recent years are variable and a significant
statistical trend, either up or down, cannot be detected.  The fishery has
been regulated for just three years and since the expected rates of change in
shark abundance are low, and our measures of stock abundance are uncertain,
sufficient observational data are not yet available to detect significant
changes in stock size after management measures were implemented. 
Nevertheless, additional reductions in fishing mortality would improve the
probability of stock increases for Large Coastal sharks.  Analyses indicate
that recovery is morel likely to occur with reductions in effective fishing
mortality rate of 50% or more.  Reductions in effective fishing mortality can
be achieved by a change in the basic quota, minimum sizes, strategies to
differentially reduce fishing mortality on females, and seasonal closures to
protect reproductive females and young of the year.  Insufficient data is
still the main impediment to improving shark stock assessments.

Efficiency in an open access fishery may involve a permanent increase in
the total expenditure of factors employed in the fishery as opposed to a
reduction in total fishing effort as proposed by Smith (1969).  This result is
obtained without modification of the basic ingredients of the fishery model. 
Using a somewhat different biological mechanism, a decrease in population
under regulation is possible.  Throughout the analysis, problems of mesh size
and crowding are abstracted from, concentrating exclusively on the effect of
effort on population using steady state solutions.

effort, and resulting CPUE are given for many of the important recreational
billfish fishing areas.  A comparison of CPUE trends between the commercial
longline and the recreational angler is made for the area about the southern
tip of Baja California where high CPUE rates are common to both fisheries. 
The correlation between recreational and commercial CPUE is reasonable
(Y2=0.82), and the recreational angler CPUE is negatively affected by the
nearby commercial longline fishery.

Migration patterns and rates for striped marlin tagged and recaptured in

analyzed.  Few long range migrations and no trans-Pacific migrations were
observed.  Comparisons are made with other types of physical and biological
data that might indicate seasonal movement (i.e. longline catch rates, areas
of striped marlin spawning, movement of thermocline depth relative to fishing
success).  A tentative hypothesis describing the seasonal movement of striped
marlin in the northeast Pacific and the total eastern Pacific is also proposed
and presented in graphic form.

Industry Structure: An Application of the Long-Run Profit Function
to the New England Fishing Industry.""  Draft, National Marine
Fisheries Service, La Jolla, California.
The long run multiproduct profit function is developed to provide a more
general procedure than the static minimum cost function to examine the
technological and cost determinants of multiproduct industry structure and the
likely form of any market equilibrium.  In this approach, outputs are
endogenous and the long run equilibrium levels of quasi-fixed factors are
endogenously determined.  The multiproduct structure of the multispecies New
England fishing industry and the likely multiproduct form of any open access
equilibrium are examined.
Squires, Dale (1987). ""Fishing Effort: Its Testing, Specification, and
Internal Structure in Fisheries Economics and Management."" 
Journal of Environmental Economics and Management  14(3):268-282.
The concept of fishing effort is central to fisheries economics and
management.  However, effort is an aggregate index of inputs which can be
consistently formed only under the condition of production technology of
homothetic separability of inputs.  This paper develops the conditions under
which effort can be consistently formed.  It then provides the first empirical
test for effort and jointness in inputs in a fishery by estimating a
multiproduct function for the New England otter trawl fleet.  After not
rejecting input-output separability and rejecting nonjointness in inputs, the
construction of a superlative index for effort is demonstrated through
estimating a translog production function.,  The implications of effort's
internal structure for fisheries management are then considered.633Squires, Dale (1987). ""Long-Run Profit Functions for Multiproduct
Firms.""  American Journal of Agricultural Economics , 69(3):558-
569.
A long run specification of the multiproduct profit function is
developed from the restricted profit function.  The multiproduct restricted
profit function and the envelope condition are used to estimate the optimal,
long run levels of the quasi-fixed factor.  Formulas for long run Marshallian
elasticities of substitution and transformation, economics of scope, product
specific and overall economies of scale, and economic measures of capacity
utilization are developed for the translog functional form.  The methodology
is illustrated by a case study of the New England otter trawl industry.

This article considers the problem of managing multispecies fishing
industries as one of regulating the production of individual multiproduct
firms.  The multispecies New England otter trawl industry is examined within
this framework.  Empirical results derived from estimating a multiproduct

multiproduct production and costs would directly regulate inputs.  Little

This study is concerned with the measurement of total factor
productivity in the marine fishing industries in general and in the Pacific
coast trawl fishery in particular.  The study is divided into two parts.  Part
I contains suitable empirical and introductory theoretical material for the
examination of productivity in the Pacific coast trawl fleet.  It is self-
contained, and contains the basic formulae, empirical results, and discussion. 
Because the economic theory of index numbers and productivity is constantly
evolving and is widely scattered throughout the economics literature, Part II
draws together the theoretical literature into one place to allow ready access
for readers interested in more details.  This study recommends that the
following types of economic index numbers be used: chain rather than fixed
base; bilateral rather than multilateral; one  of the class of superlative
indices, such as the Tornqvist or Fisher Ideal.

Quotas in Multiproduct Pacific Fisheries.""  Draft report, NMFS,
SWFC, La Jolla, California.
This paper ex ante analyzes a potential program of individual
transferable quotas for one output in a multiproduct common property fishery
with two size classes of vessels assuming that firms are revenue maximizers. 
The paper finds only moderate potential for resource rents and efficiency
gains from quota trade and explicitly valuing the marginal user cost of the
resource.  The justification of an ITQ program as a system for generating
resource rents net of regulatory costs is questionable.  Limiting the number
of vessels when production is joint is considered as an alternative. 634Evaluating the incentives for disinvestment and industry exit after quota
exchange indicated potential for a concentrated industry structure with the
larger size class.  Their quota market would potentially be thin, noisy, and
noncompetitive, requiring restrictions on their quota transferability and
concentration.
Squires, D. (1991).  ""Individual Transferable Quotas: Theory and an
Application.""  NMFS, SWFC, Administrative Report LJ-90-16, La
Jolla, CA.
A system of tradeable quotas can regulate production flows or reorganize
an industry suffering from chronic overproduction, excessive numbers of firms,
or overcapitalization.  An overall production target is established and firms
are allocated divisible rights to a quantity of the overall production.  Firms
maximize profits by adjusting production levels through trade of these
quantitative restrictions while the overall quantity objective is satisfied. 
Firms with advantages in costs or capacity utilization can bid quota away from
other firms.  Through competition, equilibrium market prices for the quota
develop, where these quota prices reflect the net discounted present value of
the expected stream of future benefits.  The initial recipients of tradeable
quota who sell or lease to more efficient firms will enjoy this stream of
future benefits, while the purchaser must pay full value.  Both parties gain
from exchange and arbitrage efficiency is realized.

Resource Industries: An Application to the Pacific Coast Trawl
Fishery.""  Rand Journal of Economics , 23(2):221-236.
This article measures total factor productivity in industries that
exploit resources held in common.  Particular attention is paid to the
valuation and specification of in situ common property resources in a
neoclassical production technology, catchability of the resource, and
variations in economic capacity utilization.  An empirical analysis of the
open access Pacific coast trawl fishing industry demonstrates that
disentangling the productivity residual from changes in resource abundance,
its catchability, and variations in capacity utilization hones the
productivity residual to finer precision, lowering mean productivity growth by
about half.  Removing biological noise from highly variable resources is also
important.  The results are related to a program limiting the number of
vessels and can contribute to sustainable resource management whenever
resources are held in common.

This paper extends the virtual price framework of Neary and Roberts to
allow trade of individual quotas and other quantitative restrictions on firms. 
The approach gives the expected equilibrium market price of the individual
transferable quota, rents, and grains in arbitrage efficiency from quota
trade.  Information on costs and technology known best by firms is combined
with overall quantity information known best by regulators to give a uniform
price signal -- the quota price after exchange -- equivalent to a tax uniform
across firms.  The framework is also matched with recent advances in
multiproduct capacity utilization to evaluate prospective changes in
multiproduct industry structure following quota trade and implications for the
quota market.  The approach is applied to ex ante analyze a potential program
of individual transferable quotas in a common property fishery.635Squires, Dale (1994).  ""Sources of Growth in Marine Fishing Industries."" 
Marine Policy , 18(1):5-18.
Policy makers and fishery managers require accurate overviews of the
performance of their harvesting sectors; trends in effective, as opposed to
nominal, effort; and productivity creep due to unmeasurable factors. 
Traditional measures of nominal effort can lead to biased performance measures
sine fishing effort is a multidimensional concept not readily captured by
nominal measures.  This paper evaluates the sources of growth in catch over
time according to its constituent components - the growth accounting framework
- to measure trends in catch, nominal, and effective effort, and productivity
or fishing power.  An empirical study of the U.S. Pacific coast groundfish
trawl fishery indicates that traditional measures of effort and fishing power
can be biased and highlights the relative importance of growth in productivity
or fishing power as an often overlooked and perhaps the most important source
of growth.

Assessing the individual firm's technology and costs in a multispecies
fishery allows design of a more effective output quota prior to regulation by
anticipating and controlling for the firm's regulation-induced responses.  An
empirical study of a Pacific coast trawl fishery indicates that the firm's
flexibility of product decision is tightly constrained by its technology and
cost structure.  Hence, as the resource stock for the regulated species, sable
fish, deteriorates and the trip quota progressively tightens, the firm cannot
sufficiently reorganize its product bundle to preclude increasingly large
sablefish disposal.  This defeats the purpose of the production quota.

This paper ex ante analyses potential individual transferable quota
(ITQ) programs for three fish species, two species of thornyheads and

the United States.  Using a dual revenue function, the concept of virtual
prices, and price endogenous, nonlinear mathematical programming, economic
rents and gains in economic efficiency from trade associated with an ITQ

resource rents from an ITQ program for either single species.  In addition,
the potential benefits due to and ITQ program for both species are diminished
by limitations in reorganizing joint production of fish under additional quota
constraints.  Justification of an ITQ program as a system for generating
resource rents over and above regulatory costs is questionable.

delivering to motherships, and to catcher vessels delivering to onshore
producers of surimi, headed and gutted, and fillets.  Net economic benefits
were measured as the present value of producer surplus and were evaluated over
a twenty year time horizon starting in 1997.  For the first time in fishery
economics, an attempt was made to include fixed costs.  However, data on fixed
costs proved inadequate for a detailed analysis, and the analysis confined
itself to net benefits measured using total revenues and variable (operating)
economic costs.

Previous research has shown that the South Australian Southern Zone rock
lobster fishery is economically overexploited, implying that a reduction in
fishing effort will improve economic efficiency in the fishery.  A scheme,
consisting of a mandatory pot reduction of 15% and the replacement of the
pot/vessel allocation formula with minimum and maximum pot entitlements of 25
and 80, respectively, was introduced in the fishery in September 1984 for this
purpose.  Analyses of the effect of the scheme on fishing effort and the
number of fishermen and some observations on the response of fishermen to the
scheme are provided.  While the pot reduction has had a small effect on
fishing effort, it has failed to induce significant rationalization within the
fishery.  Remaining fishermen have responded by working a smaller number of
pots more intensively than they had prior to the introduction of the scheme.638Stansby, Maurice E. (1987).  ""Nutritional Properties of Recreationally

The main aim of this analysis of marine ecosystems is to show how

depends on the other.  It also provides a basis for speculation about the
effects of man's intervention in marine ecosystems and the way in which these
differ from the consequences of his action on land.  Our excessive fishing
activities can greatly alter or destroy certain fisheries without any
catastrophic changes in the rest of the system.  On the other hand,
eutrophication in fresh water, by altering the plant populations, appears to
induce changes in the whole of the system.  These examples can be fitted into
the theoretical framework, and this framework can be used to approach recent
or future problems of man's impact in the open sea.

Party and charter angler expenditure and for-hire vessel cost data,

modeling system.  Trip related expenditures were analyzed separately for Maine
residents and nonresidents and a linear production function representing
average for-hire operating expenditures was estimated and integrated into the
IMPLAN system.  Results illustrate the direct, indirect, and induced economic
contributions of total sales, income, and employment generated by the for-hire
sector in Maine in 1996.  In total, the $1.07 million estimated to have been
spent by nonresident party and charter anglers in 1996 resulted in $1.41
million in sales, $0.45 million in income and provided for approximately 43
jobs in Maine.  The $0.27 million in total expenditures by residents in 1996
was estimated to generate $0.29 million in sales in Maine, $0.09 million in
income and resulted in approximately 12 jobs.  The procedures and data sets
applied here, if used in conjunction with future versions of the IMPLAN

An examination of the biological, social, and economic aspects of
fisheries suggests that differences in temporal and spatial scale may pose a
major challenge to their successful integration in management.  Management
actions to date have been dominated by biological matters.  Resulting
fisheries management decisions have not always been successful and have led to
questions of the appropriateness of the management scale.  Interestingly,
proposed solutions have resulted in the apparently inconsistent direction
towards both smaller scale (e.g. consideration of separate spawning groups
within stock complexes) and towards increased scale (e.g. multispecies or
ecosystem approaches).  Enhanced integration of economic and social641considerations compounds the complications of scale.  The challenge for
management will be to overcome the complication of scale by recognition of the
implications of a mixture of scales.

Pacific Halibut Fishery.""  Marine Resource Economics , 3(2):137-
153.
One of the predicted effects of regulation to curtail overfishing is
""capital stuffing"" where boats are overcapitalized to take maximum advantage
of limited entry licensing or restrictions of the fishing season.  The present
paper utilizes a short run competitive fishery model to assess the effects of
quotas and season restrictions in the Pacific halibut fishery.  The results in
this case show labor productivity (a proxy for capital intensity) to be less
strongly related to the length of the fishing season than to the halibut
price, implying that the main effect of the quota may be an indirect one,
through restricting supply and raising the price.
Stollery, Kenneth (1986).  ""Monopsony Processing in an Open-Access
Fishery.""  Marine Resource Economics , 3(4):331-351.
In a recent paper, Clark and Munro (1980) showed that monopsony
processing more than offsets the effects of open access in the harvesting
sector of a commercial fishery, and leads to over conservation of the
resource.  We show here that this conclusion depends critically on the cost of
capacity and consequent ease of entry and exit from the harvesting sector.  In
particular, for low entry and exit speeds the monopsonist has a high degree of
monopoly power and by depressing the price over conserves the natural resource
relative to the social optimum, while as the adjustment speed approaches
infinity a monopsonist employing a discount rate equal to the social rate of
discount will be induced to behave optimally from the viewpoint of society. 
By means of a simulation employing parameters from the Pacific halibut
fishery, we also show that a monopsonist subject to relatively sluggish entry
or exit may reap profits considerably less than the resource rents accruing if
the resource were optimally managed.
Stollery, Kenneth (1988).  ""Cooperatives as an Alternative to Regulation
in Commercial Fisheries.""  Marine Resource Economics , 4:289-304.
the problem of fisheries regulation is essentially one of assigning
property rights to a scarce resource.  This paper investigates the effects of
the establishment of a fishery cooperative as an alternative to limited entry
licensing of a fishery, in effect transferring the property rights to the
managers of the cooperative.  The consequences of this for resource
conservation are found to depend on the cooperative management policy.  While
a cooperative that is passive with respect to entry will behave in a manner
identical to that of a competitive fishery, a cooperative that limits entry to

Stone, Christopher D. (1997).   The Maladies in Global Fisheries: Are Trade
Laws Part of the Treatment?   Working Paper No. 97-12, University of
Southern California Law School, Los Angeles, CA.
The world capture fisheries are being over exploited.  Across vast
areas, a reduction in pressure, by providing stocks an opportunity to rebuild,
would increase productivity and maximize revenues in the long run.  Fisheries
managers are utilizing an array of techniques, including restraints on time,
place, gear, and catch, to dampen the level of harvest.  But their efforts are
resisted and undermined, even rendered counter productive, by excess sector
specific capital and labor.  There is no single remedy.  But subsidies are a
crucial culprit.  Fishing subsidies, estimated at tens of billions of dollars
annually world wide, lure and shelter the excessive catch capacity.  As a
consequence, fishery subsidies (and  overcapacity ) are being called into
question in a variety of fora.  This paper proposes that trade disciplines
should be more aggressively deployed in this campaign.  Fish products
constitute one of the major components in world trade.  Many government
programs designed to support fisheries appear to be in clear violation of the
GATT.  Hence, anti-subsidy disciplines and other trade related measures are
response mechanisms already in place.  There are, of course, major barriers to
any assault on practices as widespread and entrenched as fishing subsidies. 
But inroads have been made, or are in the offing, even in the farm sector.  In
fishing, prospects for reform under the trade law are brightened by potential
support of resource and environmental constituencies.

Stopher, Peter R. (1969).  ""A Probability Model of Travel Mode Choice
for the Work Journey.""  Highway Research Record , 283:57-65.
This paper describes the derivation of a probability model of travel
mode choice for the work journey in terms of the differences in costs and
times between the modes available for each individual's journey.  The work is
based on surveys carried out at two offices in central London, with some test
data from a survey of workers in central Leeds.  Regression techniques were
used to establish simple linear relationships between the probability of using
a car and the cost and time differences between a car and the best available
public transport route.  Reasonable correlation coefficients were obtained. 
Limited tests of the models have reproduced existing mode choices to a high
degree of accuracy.  Relationships were also established between the
regression coefficients and income.  A generalized model is derived from these
relationships.  The basic model has a serious fault in that because it is
linear, it permits values of probability to be obtained that exceed unity, or
are less than zero.  A logistic transformation is put forward to correct this
and is used on the generalized model.  The resulting model still appears to
reproduce existing conditions to a similarly high degree of accuracy.  The
model appears to be reasonably behavioral, and could form the basis of a new
and more accurate mode choice procedure.

This report contains information regarding both the costs and benefits
of protecting marine mammals and threatened marine species.  The report is
organized according to the explicit and implicit costs of restricting marine
fishing and the economic value of marine mammals.  The conflict between free
trade and global marine resources is examined in light of two conflicts - the
dolphin bycatch by tuna vessels in the Eastern Tropical Pacific and sea turtle
bycatch by shrimpers in the Caribbean.  The implicit costs to U.S. consumers
from various policies restricting trade in tuna and explicit costs to U.S.
tuna fishermen from avoiding dolphins in the ETP are presented.  Substitution
among animal protein sources in Japan is examined and adds to our
understanding of how sanctions against food from the sea effect the
terrestrial environment.  Finally, a survey of Massachusetts citizens and
scientists regarding their willingness to pay for the elimination of the
bycatch of harbor porpoises in New England waters is presented.  We provide
estimates indicating that the costs of marine mammal protection, both to
fishermen and consumers, are large, that the stated willingness to pay of
Massachusetts citizens for the marine mammal protection is large, and that the
preferences for the protection of harbor porpoises by scientists are not
distinct from preferences of the general public.

A two-stage, two-player noncooperative game model is developed (under an
irreversible capital investment assumption) with the main aim of predicting
the number of vessels that each player in such a game will find in his best
interest to employ in the exploitation of the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock, given
a noncooperative environment and the fact that all players are jointly
constrained by the population dynamics of the resource.  The predictions so
obtained are then compared with (i) the sole owner s optimal capacity
investments for the two players; (ii) the results in Sumaila (1994), where
perfect malleability of capacity is assumed implicitly; and (iii) available
data on the Arcto-Norwegian cod fishery.

that attempts to capture the predator-prey relationships between cod and
capelin, the two main species in the habitat.  The aim is to analyze joint
cooperative (versus separate noncooperative) management of this predator-prey
system with a view to isolating the efficiency loss due to separate
management.  Using a game theoretic framework and a multicohort age-structured
bioeconomic model, we compute joint and separate management equilibrium
outcomes for the model and investigate the effects of changes in economic
parameters on the computed results.  In this way, we explore the economic
consequences of the predator-prey relationships between cod and capelin and
the externalities due to noncooperation.  Results of the study tend to suggest
that (i) under current market conditions, it is economically optimal to
exploit both species (rather than just one of them) under joint management;
(ii) in comparison with the separate management outcome, a severe reduction of
the capelin fishery is called for under joint management; and (iii) the loss
in discounted economic rent resulting from the externalities due to the
natural interactions between the species is significant, reaching up to almost
a quarter of what is achievable under separate management.

Recreation demand and value are estimated with the travel cost method
for fishing, camping, boating, and swimming on a site specific regional basis. 
The model is regional in that 179 sites are defined for the Pacific Northwest. 
A gravity model is employed to estimate the number of trips from each origin
to each destination in the region, and these data are the basic input in the
travel cost demand curves.  The model is illustrated by estimating the
recreation benefits that would result from meeting the national environmental
goal of fishable and swimmable rivers.  The main finding is that potential647recreation benefits are concentrated in a few select areas, that are
accessible to large population centers.

Basic economic concepts are introduced and applied to problems of

Management policies for rational use of the resource are developed and
explained.  When commercial and recreational users compete under open access
for the same fishery resource the paper shows how economic factors determine
the levels of commercial and recreational effort.  The economic principles are
explained in nontechnical terms for determining the optimal allocation between
commercial and recreational users when the fishery is rationally managed.

This article focuses on measuring and explaining noncompliance in
federally managed U.S. fisheries.  Novel measurement techniques are used to
characterize the extent and patterns of noncompliance in the northeast
groundfish fishery.  According to the authors's estimates, noncompliance
increased substantially in 1986 and remained high through 1988 in the
groundfish fishery.  On Georges Bank during 1987, a quarter to half of all
groundfish vessels were identified as frequent violators, committing closed
area violations on about one-third of their trips and using illegal mesh on
nearly all trips.  Illegal earnings by a typical frequent violator operating
in the groundfish fishery on Georges Bank amounted to $225,000 per year in
1987.
 A theory of compliance in fisheries is developed and applied to explain
the trends and patterns of noncompliance in the northeast groundfish fishery. 
Biological and economic forces are shown to be dominant causes of the recent
deterioration in compliance.  Other contributing factors include weak
sanctions and insufficient enforcement resources.  The article concludes with
a prognosis for the fishery and recommendations for improving compliance.

This paper synthesizes familiar theories of nonrenewable and renewable
resource economics in a two sector, partial equilibrium analysis of efficient
trade offs between renewable resource production and environmental
development.  The irreversible impacts of coastal zone development provide a650motivating example.  While development proceeds, the efficient harvest of
renewable resources may exceed the sustainable rate.  While development may
involve several periods of growth and decline, once development begins it
proceeds without significant interruptions.  If a profitable renewable sector
survives, development ceases before exhausting all profitable opportunities. 
Interdependent stocks reduce distinctions between resource types because each
sector exhibits features of the other.

Resource managers often ignore economic information in decisions about
recreational use of fish and wildlife resources.  By evaluating within season
harvest regulations, economists can identify strategies to improve
recreational benefits without compromising management objectives represented
in an annual harvest quota.  Theoretical analysis raises a potential for bias
in applied welfare analysis if regulations inefficiently trade off fishing
quality and exogenous seasonality in anglers' demand.  Simulations demonstrate
that efficient regulations may limit daily harvests during the best fishing
season or during the peak season of demand.  Inadequate knowledge of
recreationists' behavioral responses to quality and regulations currently
limits policy assessments.
Swallow, Stephen (1994).  Renewable and Nonrenewable Resource Theory
Applied to Coastal Agriculture, Forest, Wetland, and Fishery
Linkages.""  Marine Resource Economics , 9(4):291-310.
This paper addresses tradeoffs in wetland development using a framework
that integrates economic theory of renewable and nonrenewable resources.  The
theory treats wetland development as use of a nonrenewable resource, while
wetland preservation protects critical fishery habitat.  The framework
recognizes that wetland quality may vary for either development or fisheries. 
An illustrative application assesses tradeoffs in converting pocosin wetlands
to agriculture rather than maintaining wetlands to protect salinity in
estuarine nursery areas.  Results reveal the marginal value of salinity
protection may be substantial, while location may affect a wetland's value to
an estuarine shrimp fishery.  Comparisons between agricultural and forestry
land uses show that ecological links may cause wetland values to depend upon
the land use chosen for the developed state.  Future assessments of other
development may reveal additional impacts through impacts on salinity.

Relevant Nonconvexities in the Production of Multiple Forest
Benefits.""  Journal of Environmental Economics and Management ,
19:264-280.
This paper challenges common assumptions about convexity in forest
rotation models that optimize timber plus nontimber benefits.  If a local
optimum occurs earlier than the globally optimal age, policy based on marginal
incentives may achieve suboptimal results.  Policy relevant nonconvexities are
more likely if (i) nontimber benefits dominate for young stands while the
optimal age depends primarily on timber benefits or (ii) nontimber benefits
dominate for mature stands and also determine the optimal age.  Nonconvexities
may create either temporary or persistent difficulties.  Policy makers may
improve efficiency by exploiting the relationship between the timber only
optimum and the global optimum.

In many studies of nonmarket resources, economists have data to
disaggregate results according to subpopulations within the full study
population.  Disaggregated results can increase the usefulness of economic
analyses, improve public confidence in the results, and permit public
officials to assess equity concerns.  We outline an approach to obtain
disaggregated results when characteristics of individuals may identify
distinct preferences.  The approach is applied to public preferences regarding
landfill siting decisions.  The discussion explores the implications of
disaggregated results for policy decisions, for bias in aggregate willingness
to pay estimates, and for nonmarket research methodologies.

The methods by which fishery scientists estimate fish populations size
are reviewed.  These include tagging, cohort analysis, random sampling and
catch per unit of effort indexes.  Elementary statistical considerations are
introduced to discuss some of the properties of the methods.  For example, we
model the effect of spatial patchiness on random sampling and the effect of
sample size on tagging estimates.  Next, the Poisson, negative binomial, and
gamma distributions and their interrelations are discussed.  In particular,
these three distribution form a do-it-yourself kit for making models of the
fisherman's catch per trip.
One policy tool suggested for fishery regulation is the auction of
licenses.  Smiley has extended the bidding models of Wilson and Rothkopf and
applied them to empirical data on offshore oil lease bids.  We discuss
Smiley's model, which could provide information about fishermen's expectations
and learning about abundance, if and when auction schemes are implemented for
fisheries.  Finally, we review the application of logit estimation as a tool
for studying the discrete choice behavior of fishermen.

of an exhaustible resource, we derive the appropriate specifications for
aggregate extraction and exploration cost functions and analyze the behavior
of a competitive industry.  The proper specification of the aggregate
extraction cost function depends on the exploration technology and is
generally different from the usual no discovery specification.  The common
practice of combining the no discovery cost function with exploration results
in a misspecified model for which the total cost of extracting the resource is
not well defined.  The widely accepted prediction that the anticipated
discovery of low cost deposits can result in a U-shaped price path appears to
be an artifact of this misspecification.  For our properly specified cost
functions, the predicted resource price is always rising, in spite of the
continued discovery of low cost deposits.

During 1968, there were 24 bona fide live bait shrimp dealers operating
in Alabama who sold 1,544,000 live shrimp and 22,200 pounds of dead shrimp
having a retail value of $76,540.  The capital investment per dealer was
$3,303 for facilities and equipment.  No shrimp were exported from Alabama,
and only a negligible amount was imported.  Brown shrimp ( Penaeus  aztecus ) and
white shrimp ( Penaeus  setiferus ) were the major species taken.  Brown shrimp
entered the estuaries first and were gradually replaced by white shrimp.  The
fishery normally operates from June through November.  Length-weight
relationships were determined for brown shrimp, white shrimp, and pink shrimp
(Penaeus  duorarum ).

Center, Newport, Oregon.
Market related issues are often implicitly or explicitly treated as
exogenous to the fisheries policy problem.  Examples illustrate the
relationship of market demand, variation in intrinsic and extrinsic seafood
qualities, and regulatory policy.  A dynamic multiobjective model is used to
demonstrate how policy factors including market information, regulatory
instruments, and fishery stock dynamics can impact the levels and distribution
of social benefits.  Socioeconomic policy information is summarized in the
form of dynamic and capitalized policy frontiers.
Sylvia, Gilbert and Deqin Cai (1995).  ""Generating Policy Information
for Fisheries Management: A Comparison of Alternative Approaches."" 
Marine Resource Economics , 10(1):77-91.
The potential for economic policy modeling approaches under alternative
theories of fisheries management are reviewed.  Conceptual dynamic models are
developed to illustrate the discussion.  Results suggest that the class of
multi objective models known as multi attribute utility theory are consistent
with a fisheries policy process characterized primarily by principles of
scientific management.  Conversely, multi objective policy models based on
generating techniques may be more appropriate when the policy process is
driven by a pluralistic process.  Conceptual and numerical models are used to
demonstrate the potential for these approaches in incorporating environmental
externalities.  Dynamic and capitalized policy frontiers are generated for
purposes of comparative analysis.  The paper concludes by emphasizing the role
that multi objective methods can play in improving the efficiency of the
fisheries policy process.

A multiobjective bioeconomic policy model was developed for the United
States Pacific whiting fishery.  Pareto optimal solutions for three policy
objectives-rents, production, and female spawning biomass-were developed and
analyzed using ""hybrid"" generating technique.  Three policy instruments were
considered: harvest quotas, fleet capacity limits, and allocation between
shore based and offshore fisheries.  Results indicate that Pareto optimal
allocations to shore based and at sea industries will depend on the spatial
and temporal characteristics of the stock and the assumptions regarding the
harvesting and processing characteristics of each fleet.  The analysis also
suggests approaches for measuring opportunity costs associated with
misidentifying ""biological risk"" and operationalizing the concept known as
""optimum yield"".654Sylvia, Gilbert and Sherry L. Larkin (1995).  ""Firm-Level Intermediate
Demand for Pacific Whiting Products: a Multi-Attribute, Multi-

Variation in seafood prices resulting from differences in product
characteristics are often obscured by highly aggregated data or data
representing only upstream sectors.  This can lead to myopic commodity-based
analysis that fails to identify how changes in public and private fisheries
management may impact product characteristics, market development, and long
run social benefits.  Given these problems, alternative methods are needed to
complement traditional demand, supply, and cost-benefit analysis.  Mail and
personal surveys of seafood wholesalers were conducted to determine
preferences for Pacific whiting products.  The relative importance of fillet
and headed and gutted product characteristics were determined using conjoint
analyses and factorial based market experiments.  Estimation of relative
profitability, probability of purchase, and sort run  conditional  demand
models revealed the importance of wholesaler characteristics, physical product
characteristics, and contractual arrangements.  Marketing margins and demands
for improved products were also estimated.  Implications for private and
public resource management are discussed.

Twelve models were formulated by segmenting the total travel time and
total travel cost by rapid transit and by automobile in different ways or by
leaving them out completely and including only socioeconomic variables in the
model.  These models were then estimated by using logit, probit, and
discriminant analyses.  The results were evaluated in two respects: (1) are
there differences in performance among the methods of estimation and (2) are
there differences in performance among the twelve model specifications?  The
results indicate that there are no statistically significant differences
either among the methods of estimation or among the model specifications
themselves.  A model that uses only two user characteristics, income and the
number of working household members, and one system related variable, a dummy655variable for walk access to the transit station, performs no worse than a
model that uses a whole set of system characteristics in addition to those
three variables.  Values of time significantly lower than those previously
reported were found; the best estimate in this study is only twelve percent of
the wage rate.

Routine culture of larvae has not yet been achieved, whereas it has for

nutritional needs, and the maintenance of high water quality standards are
major constraints in larval culture.  Growth in older animals, although
naturally slow, can be enhanced by environmental manipulation.  Several
species appear well suited for advanced culture efforts including poly
culture.  Coordinated programs of aquaculture and fisheries management appear
feasible.

Study of Sea Turtles.""  Draft report submitted to the Journal of656Wildlife Management .
Due to world wide declines in sea turtle populations, efforts are being
made to mitigate effects on humans on turtle mortality.  This paper shows
conservation efforts can be interpreted only with population monitoring and an
understanding of population dynamics.  The example used investigates whether
we can detect changes in nesting turtle numbers from reduced turtle mortality
through use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) on shrimp trawls.  An age
specific model of the Little Cumberland Island, Georgia population of
loggerhead sea turtles ( Caretta ), concludes that the two largest sources of
uncertainty, unknown age of first reproduction (AFR) and unknown history of
survival rate changes, have large effects on future population trajectories. 
Unless estimates of AFR are improved, it will be impossible to interpret the
effect of TED use in the next decade.  Models must account for population
history.  Use of time invariant survival rates leads to overestimation of our
ability to detect the effect of TED use.  Caution is advised when interpreting
results obtained form equations that use only population size, particularly
when data represent a portion of the population.

During October, 1979, the R/V Dan Moore utilized a conventional shrimp
trawl at 22 locations offshore North Carolina from south of Cape Hatteras to
southwest of Cape Fear in search of rock shrimp.  Data were compiled on
distribution, relative abundance, size and sex composition, and cull rates. 
Rock shrimp were found to be more abundant in Long Bay than in Onslow and
Raleigh Bays, and it was evident that catches decreased in numbers as latitude
increased.  Although the vast majority (94.8%) of rock shrimp captured were of
commercial size, nowhere were they located in commercially significant
concentrations.  Males averaged slightly smaller in total length than females
and females became more numerous than males in the larger size categories. 
Sex ratio did not vary significantly from 1:1.

This paper explores duality relationships for a broad class of
stochastic dynamic production problems.  Assuming that the decision maker
maximizes the expected present value of profit, it is shown that product
supply, negative factor demand, and negative quasifixed factor acquisition657equations cannot be directly obtained by partial differentiation of the
indirect profit function if price expectations have a Markovian structure. 
Consequently, empirical application of duality to many stochastic dynamic
problems is quite complex and may be more difficult than a primal approach to
the problem.

Department, P.O. Box 110240, Institute of Food and Agricultural
Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.
In June 1991, domestic and international fishery management agencies
imposed quotas and minimum size requirements on participants in the North
Atlantic swordfish fishery in an attempt to reduce the high rate of fishing
mortality that threatens the future commercial viability of the swordfish
fishery.  However, findings from a 91-92 MARFIN report (Thunberg, et. al.,
1992) indicate that management objectives designed to limit swordfish harvest
may initiate a redirection of effort toward the many commercially valuable
tuna species.  Tuna may be landed with essentially the same gear and vessels
that are used in the pursuit of swordfish.  Therefore, the management
initiatives imposed in 1991 have implications for both swordfish and tuna
stocks.  The objectives of this study were 1) to analyze the economic
interrelationships between swordfish and tuna in the south Atlantic and Gulf
of Mexico region, in particular to attempt to determine the importance of
exvessel prices in conditioning the direction of effort between these two
potential target species, and 2) to estimate the effect of swordfish
management policy on longline fishing effort and landings in this region.  To
accomplish these goals, a dual based revenue function was specified, from
which effort supply functions were derived and estimated.  These functions
related directed effort with exvessel prices and a composite input, and were
used to test for non-jointness in inputs, i.e. the output of one species is
determined independently of the price of the other species in a multi-product
fishery.  Results indicate that nonjointness is rejected for swordfish and
tuna, implying an economic interrelationship does exist.  This finding calls
into question the ability to manage swordfish as a single species.  Further,658the models detected a statistically significant redirection of effort from
swordfish to tuna since the imposition of management measures.  This evidence
suggests that the problems of recruitment failure and declining average size
per harvested fish due to overfishing which now characterize the swordfish
fishery should be anticipated with respect to tuna stocks and addressed in
future management measures.

Effective Sampling of Marine Sport Anglers.   Marine Resource Economics ,
12(1):1-10.
An obstacle to conducting economic studies of marine sport anglers is
the difficulty and expense in drawing a representative sample.  Unlike inland
fishing, where licenses are required in all states, only selected states
require a marine sport fishing license and these license usually only cover
selected marine fishing activities.  Currently, there are no low cost methods
of obtaining a representative sample of marine anglers because they are
generally not licensed, use multiple access points, and represent a small
proportion of the general population.  The difficulty and expense of drawing a
representative sample may have stifled attempts to study marine anglers.  We
test alternative sampling strategies by comparing the characteristics of a659representative sample of experienced marine anglers with the characteristics
of two other samples using multivariate and univariate analysis techniques. 
We conclude a sample of marine anglers drawn from the population of licensed
inland anglers is not significantly different from the representative sample
of experienced marine anglers.

In this paper, the impact on consumers from the dolphin-safe labeling
program are measured in two ways.  First, a demand system for the canned
protein market is estimated by using retail level data to identify whether
dolphin-safe labels alter consumer purchases of tuna.  Second, the estimated
demand system is used to provide a lower bound on the welfare effects of the
dolphin-safe labeling policy using the assumption that any shifts in demand
resulting from the dolphin-safe labels would reflect a type of non-use value. 
Hypothetical approaches (e.g., contingent valuation) are commonly considered
the only means of eliciting non-use values.  However, dolphin-safe labeling
policies would seem a case in which public non-use values for a resource could
be deduced from observable behavior.

Test-retest, the standard method used to investigate reliability of
contingent valuation, is limited because when the time period between the two
surveys is relatively short the study may exhibit testing recall.  Conversely,
when the time between the two surveys increases there is an increased chance
the true value will change.  The test-retest design cannot isolate these
effects.  Independent pretest and posttest control groups allow testing of
reliability even when recall occurs or the true value changes.  Using this
design, we found ex post estimates of Hicksian surplus are reliable regardless
of whether respondents have direct experience with an activity.

Analysis of Real Net Investment in Fishing Vessels."" 
Dissertation, Department of Agricultural Economics, Texas A&M
University, College Station, 140 pp.
The real net investment in fishing vessels in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp
fishery is analyzed employing an econometric model.  The model is simulated
over a 17 year period to examine the short and intermediate run impacts of
changes in such policy variables as the real rate of interest, cost of equity
capital, investment tax credit and income tax on investment behavior in
fishing vessels.  A forecast over a 5 year period (1978 - 1982) for real net
investment in fishing vessels is also developed.
Investment tax credit stimulates investment expenditure in the Gulf
shrimp fishery.  However, income tax exerts the greatest influence on
investment decisions in the fishing industry.  While both steel and wooden
vessels are expected to show continuous growth from 1978 to 1982, the stock of
steel vessels should grow about three times as fast as wooden ones over this
period.
Tettey, E.O., and W.L. Griffin (1984).  ""Investment in Gulf of Mexico
Shrimp Vessels, 1965-77.""  Marine Fisheries Review , 46(2):49-52.
This study examines implications of investment patterns in the Gulf
shrimp fishery.  Historical trends in capital stock of different vessel types
are estimated for 1965-77 for use with landings and sales data.  Specifically,
annual trends in total and per vessel shrimp landings and sales are examined. 
Shrimp landings and sales per dollar of investment in fishing vessels are
evaluated.  Apparently, the perceived value of landings per vessel increased
on average at a faster rate than production costs per vessel causing excess
profit to exist.  This created an incentive for investments, although there
may be other reasons for stimulating investment.  This expansion was
interrupted only by poor economic conditions, such as in 1970 and 1973-75. 
Although data were not available to estimate real capital stock beyond 1977,
other information suggests that substantial declines (large negative real
investment) occurred in 1979-80.

pp.
An econometric model of annual real net investment in fishing vessels in
the Gulf is developed to determine how the cost of equity and debt capital as
well as other factors affect investment decisions in this industry.  The cost
of capital plays an important role in influencing investment decisions in the
Gulf shrimp fishing industry.  High real interest rates were found to depress
real net investment in this fishery.  Investment responses to changes in
macroeconomic policy are greatest for steel vessels because steel vessels
contribute the most to the productivity of the Gulf shrimp fishery.  Finally,
while low real interest rates are desirable for stimulating investment
activities in the general economy, they would add to the overcapitalization
problem that currently exists in the Gulf shrimp fishing industry.  This
suggests that expansionary policies designed to boost the growth of the
general economy may actually lead to undesirable results for the Gulf shrimp
fishing industry.

This study employs a financial model to examine the aggregate investment
expenditures for Gulf of Mexico shrimp vessels.  Specifically, the impacts of
tax policies - investment tax credits and income taxes - on investment
decisions in the Gulf shrimp fishery are evaluated.  Contractionary tax policy
is an effective tool in limiting entry to the shrimp fishery and, thereby,
controlling the problem of overcapitalization. Decreases in the investment tax
credit rate, increases in the income tax rate, or a combination of both
policies will curtail investment activities in the fishing industry. 
Implementation of such tax schemes should raise total revenues of vessel
owners, in the long run, from what they otherwise would have been.

Due to the inflationary trend in recent years coupled with fluctuating
shrimp prices, the shrimp business has become a highly uncertain undertaking. 
The financial performance of a sample of the Gulf of Mexico shrimping fleet,
operating out of the Texas coast, was examined over a 10 year period (1971-
80).  the results indicate that investments made in the early part of the
1970's performed better than those made in the latter part.  Periods of low663inflationary levels appeared to be more favorable to investments in the shrimp
fishery than periods of high inflationary levels.  In terms of economic
profits, steel vessels generally did better than wooden ones.  Medium sized
vessels (18.6 - 20.0 m in overall length) were the most efficient vessels to
operate in the Gulf of Mexico.

This research uses stochastic sensitivity analysis to examine an indoor
intensive red drum aquaculture facility.  Important biological and economic
factors are varied one at a time to determine the chances of survival and
success.  Results indicate that this type facility is very stable since all
but one scenario had a 100% chance of surviving.  This stability occurs
because harvesting is spread uniformly through the year.  Chances of being an
economic success range from 0 to 100% depending on the investor's required
rate of return and the assumed level of biological and economic factors
considered in this analysis.  An investor's interest in red drum farming will
depend on his individual required rate of return, his management capabilities,
the market conditions, and his willingness to take a risk.  It is certain,
however, that a 0% chance of economic success will occur for a red drum farm
under poor management.

Commercial and recreational fishermen share the same resources and must
cooperate to derive the greatest benefits for both groups.  The protection and
preservation of the habitat necessary to ensure continued commercial and
recreational fishing should be a common goal.  Each industry's contribution to
the nation's economy is substantial, and federal and state governments and the

Fishermen as Reasoned Action: Behavioral Determinants of Bycatch
Characteristics and Projected Effects of Bycatch Regulations on
Labor Decisions.""  Presentation, Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management
Council, Shrimp Trawl Bycatch Session, Corpus Christi, May, 5 pp.
This material represents initial efforts to understand the potential
effects of bycatch regulations on shrimp fishermen and are derived solely from
Alabama.  This research has two primary objectives, the first of which is to
project fishermen's labor market decisions in light of proposed regulatory
actions to reduce bycatch.  To assess this, questions were constructed
premised on the theory of reasoned action.  The theory of reasoned action
seeks to explain behavior on the basis of individual intentions to carry out665the behavior in the future.  In the case of shrimp fishermen, we test their
intentions to remain or leave shrimp fishing given the possibility of future
bycatch regulations.  Secondly, with this research we are able to establish
baseline data characterizing the economic, social, and psychological well
being of shrimp fishermen first from Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and eventually
for shrimp fishermen Gulf wide.  Finally, we are able to compare data from
this first year with data collected in a similar survey from 1987.  Thus, we
are able to discuss in this summary three major sets of findings: demographic
comparisons for 1987 and 1993-94; well being comparisons for 1987 and 1993-94;
and perceived effects of regulations on fishermen's intent concerning their
future as fishermen.

Diffusion models provide a rigorous yet highly tractable means of
representing the behavior of stochastic systems.  In this paper, attention is
focused on developing functional forms for the stationary (long-term)
probability density functions of stock size and other quantities of interest
in systems governed in part by a stock recruitment relationship (SRR).  First,
a general classification of SRRs is developed and a number of well known stock
recruitment relationships are rescaled so as to exhibit two parameters in
common, namely their resilience and their recruitment carrying capacity. 
Second, a general diffusion model is presented in which the stationary
distribution of stock size can be written explicitly as a function of four
parameters (usually rescaled linearly as a function of one or both of the
basic stock recruitment parameters): 1) the total mortality rate, 2) the net
rate of density independent migration (if any), 3) the magnitude of stochastic
perturbations in the system, and 4) the degree to which the influence of those
perturbations is a function of stock size.  Third, the fishing mortality rates
that maximize expected stationary yield are compared across SRRs and parameter
values and their potential impacts on expected recruitment are explored. 
Finally, the implications of alternative forms of the stock recruitment
relationship and alternative approaches to risk analysis (""frequentist"" versus
""decision-theoretic"") are examined.  The possibility of stock collapse is
incorporated through use of a depensatory SRR as one of the examples.

Penaeid Shrimp Hymenopenaeus  Robustus  Smith on the Continental

In the early 1950's, the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries vessel
Oregon found large concentrations of royal red shrimp, Hymenopenaeus  Robustus ,
in the northern Gulf of Mexico on the continental slope off the Mississippi
River Delta.  This finding was one result of a long term series of
explorations for resources of commercial worth that began on the continental
shelf of the northern Gulf and has since encompassed the shelf and slope from
Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Brazil in the Gulf, Caribbean, and Western
Atlantic proper.  Potentially commercial quantities of the royal red shrimp
have been found on Florida's east coast, off the Dry Tortugas, and in the
northern Gulf.  Lesser quantities of the shrimp have been found throughout the
area explored with some potential off Venezuela and Colombia in the Caribbean
and off the Guianas in the Atlantic.  By trawling the grounds where large
concentrations occurred off the U.S., and making demonstration landings as
well as publishing the results of the findings, the U.S. fishing industry has
been encouraged to make use of the new resource.  Vessels of the Bureau have
fished alongside the commercial fleet on the new grounds to encourage them,
and at present a growing interest and a small scale continuous utilization is
being seen.

These species are listed as threatened, endangered in Florida waters, and
endangered respectively.  The most conspicuous and abundant species is the
loggerhead turtle that appears to have been relatively stable in numbers since
1982.  The green turtle, that once supported a significant U.S. fishery,
appears to be increasing in Florida.  It is not known if this increase in the
number is from an expansion of range of Caribbean stocks or if there is a real
increase in the number of turtles in the U.S. stock.  The Kemp's ridley that
once nested in Mexico in the tens of thousands has been reduced to a nesting
population of less than 600 females.  If the status quo remains, this species
will be reduced to 100 nesting females within 60 years.

Fishery dependent data from various commercial and recreational sampling
programs in the U.S. form the basis for characterizing the fishery for dolphin
fishes ( Coryphaenus  hippurus ) in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off the
southeastern U.S. coast.  Many states in the region have implemented size and
bag limits for dolphin fishes, however, there are no federal regulations in
place at this time.  Commercial landings in metric tons have been relatively
small in comparison to recreational landings for the time series of data
available from 1984 through 1996.  In 1995, however, commercial landings in
the Atlantic Ocean of the southeastern U.S. were almost twice in weight of the
previous years.  The average weight per fish was calculated for each water
body and fishing sector and there appear to have been large increases in the
average weight of fish landed both in the commercial and recreational sectors
in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.  Catch per unit of effort is measured as
numbers of fish caught per angler per hour in the recreational fishery.  In
the Gulf of Mexico, recreational CPUE appears to fluctuate and appears to be
decreasing since 1985.  CPUE appears to have been increasing in the Atlantic
particularly from 1984 to 1991 and appears to have been decreasing since 1991.

Management.""  J. Fish. Res. Board Can. , 31(12):1965-1981.
The management of the Canadian Fisheries is under the authority of both
federal and provincial governments.  While it is common to the Canadian
confederation that both levels of government have dual roles in many areas of
Canadian life, the situation with respect to the fisheries tends to be more
complicated in the intricacies of federal-provincial jurisdiction.  The result
has led at times to genuine confusion as to the management prerogatives over
the Canadian fisheries.
To manage the resource it is considered requisite to have an
understanding of the legislative prerogatives of the federal and provincial668agencies responsible for Canadian fisheries.  Such as understanding will serve
to outline institutional constraints imposed upon fisheries management.
This paper examines a unique aspect of the fisheries resource that being
the nature of the governmental responsibilities in the management of the
fisheries.  This is achieved through the examination of the evolution of the
Canadian federation, the constitution, the legal aspects of the fisheries, and
the leading judicial decisions on Canadian fisheries.

some of the factors influencing the demand for shrimp as well as some of the
factors affecting the supply are discussed.  The need for better aids for
investment planning is pointed out.  This is followed by the development of a
mathematical investment financial model for the shrimp fishing firm.  Each
facet of the model is discussed with a rigorous statement of the complete

variations in price.

Stochastic Investment Model for a Survival Conscious Firm Applied
to Shrimp Fishing.""  Applied Economics , 5:75-87.
An operational stochastic capacity expansion model for a survival
conscious firm is developed and applied to shrimp fishing in which the
entrepreneur evaluates all the information known to him at the time of the
decision.  The results show the effect of survival on the growth in net worth
of a firm making sequential and irreversible purchases of physical capital669with uncertain future yields.  The survival model is applied to shrimp fishing
on the Texas Gulf coast and the results are compared to those of a simple
model in which survival is not considered.  Bankruptcy could clearly result
from the use of the simple model; survival of the firm is guaranteed by use of
the survival model.
Exit from the fishery may be restricted (sticky downward) because
fishermen's attitudes toward risk are not symmetric with regard to favorable
and unfavorable yields and prices.  Low prices and small catches in fishing
may be dreaded much more than high prices and large catches are desired.  In
the model, the firm maximizes expected net worth at the end of a finite
planning period subject to the restriction that the only allowable purchases
of capacity are those for which there is no chance of incurring bankruptcy. 
It is assumed that the firm is unwilling to assume any risk of failure.  Thus,
the survival restriction prohibits purchases of capacity which would lead to
bankruptcy during the planning period if the worse possible yields or output
prices occur in the future.  Survival considerations may result in modest
growth of capacity of a fishing firm, even if the expected profit of
additional capacity is relatively large.

question is explored within the context of whether a limited juvenile fishery
can co-exist with traditional fisheries without jeopardizing silver hake

Box 110240, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-0240.
In an attempted to reduce fishing mortality on the North Atlantic
swordfish fishery, domestic and international management agencies have
cooperated in a multilateral effort to establish quotas and minimum size
requirements.  These restrictions can have significant economic consequences
on the participants in the fishery.  However, little information on the
economic relationships of the swordfish fishery is available.  The objectives
of this study were to develop an economic model of the U.S. swordfish markets
including swordfish demand and supply functions from each of four different
sources of supply, estimate changes in consumer and producer surplus
associated with harvest reduction measures in the North Atlantic, examine the
indirect effects of North Atlantic swordfish on tunas, and nonmanagement unit
swordfish stocks.  A general equilibrium modeling approach was adopted to
construct an economic model of swordfish supply and demand.  Predicted
consumer surplus losses are $3.4 million annually, while producer surplus
losses to domestic North Atlantic swordfish fishermen are $5.98 million. 
These results are based on an analysis in which supplies of swordfish from
nonmanagement unit stocks were allowed to respond to predicted price changes
following the imposition of quotas in the North Atlantic.  Consumer surplus
losses were estimated to be slightly higher if this supply response was not
taken into account.  The results showed that changes in swordfish prices do
affect tuna markets, hence, North Atlantic swordfish management may have
unintended effects on effort directed toward tuna as a substitute species. 
Further, supply responses from nonmanagement unit were found to be greater
than that for management unit stocks suggesting that North Atlantic swordfish
management could have implications for harvest effort and management concern
toward other stocks.

A stochastic simulation approach is presented to assess the recreational

Management Plan.  Impacts are presented by mode (party/charter and
private/rental boat) and area (North: Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts,
and South: Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York).  To account for671uncertainties due to a lack of empirical data and inherent variability in
number of trips, keep rates, release mortality, compliance rates, and
behavioral changes, probability distributions were assigned and a Monte Carlo
simulation with 1,000 iterations run.  The simulation results indicate that
the combined impact of the bag and size limit management measures will result
in an expected 25% reduction in cod and haddock recreational fishing
mortality.  However, due to differences in size and catch distribution, the
management measures have a greater impact on anglers in the North.  Nearly
two-thirds of the reduction in landings may be attributable to reductions in
the Northern area party/charter and private/rental boat modes.

revenue function is specified to estimate own price and cross price
elasticities of supply for selected key species and to estimate the marginal
value of effort.  Empirical findings indicate the fishery is characterized by
joint production among all species pairs and that the complementarity of
production is strongest for mullet as compared to any other species.  This
finding implies that effective management of the near shore species complement
may be possible through management measures designed to reduce the harvest of
mullet.  The paper concludes by demonstrating the potential effect that
restricting harvest on mullet might have on landings of other near shore
species.  The amount of compensation payments required to leave commercial

Silver hake or whiting ( Merluccius  bilinearis ) range from Newfoundland
to South Carolina.  The resource has traditionally supported a U.S.A. fishery
on the adult component of the stock.  However, with developing markets for
juveniles and the possibility of increased effort, managers and industry have
expressed concern over the health of whiting stocks that are already
considered to be fully exploited.  Market prices for whiting are based upon
its size and therefore, managers are concerned not only with the overall
fishing mortality rate but with how a directed fishery on juveniles may affect
the age structure of the population.
Age structured models can be used to evaluate changes in population
structure.  However, without an understanding of the economic value of
different size components, biological models alone provide incomplete
management guidance.  In this paper, a bioeconomic model of the USA whiting
fishery is developed.  The biological component incorporates age-structured
models of whiting stocks while an economic component accounts for size based
pricing.  A revenue response surface is derived that gives the maximum revenue
obtainable from systematically varying fishing mortality and age specific
selection patterns.  A stochastic recruitment function is used that permits
assessment of revenue and yield trajectories over time, as well as their
associated probability distributions.

In this paper, a bioeconomic simulation of the U.S. fisheries for silver
hake, Merluccius  bilinearis , is presented.  The model design combines elements
of age-structured population and harvest yield models with economics of the
silver hake fishery.  The analysis evaluates both biological and economic
effects of interest to managers, such as future yields or rebuilding of
parental stock as well as future revenues and net returns to vessels.  The
bioeconomic model is used to evaluate the economic implications of tradeoffs
between alternative selection patterns in the U.S. Atlantic silver hake673fishery.  Throughout the study, a selection pattern is defined as the suite of
age-specific selection coefficients that are applied to a fish population over
time.  Of particular interest is exploration of whether tradeoffs among
segments of a fish population can result in increased resource value.  This
question is explored within the context of whether a limited juvenile fishery
can co-exist with traditional fisheries without jeopardizing silver hake
stocks and if so, under what conditions might such a fishery operate.

classes could result in short run gains in economic value that may not be
sustainable due to longer run declines in biomass, hence lowered fishery yield
and value.  By contrast, strategies to delay age at first capture may improve
economic value over current levels with only modest reductions in short run
fishery yield.

In 1991, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the participating
nations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas
(ICCAT), placed multilateral restrictions on the harvest of swordfish from
North Atlantic stocks.  These restrictions were necessary to reduce fishing
mortality on what were deemed to be overfished stocks.  A multi-market
approach is used to estimate consumer welfare changes in swordfish and tuna
markets as both markets adjust to changes in swordfish management.  The
results of this analysis are compared and contrasted with that of a partial
equilibrium approach in which market price of substitute species are held
constant.  The study findings indicate that the partial equilibrium approach
ignores the price effects of market interactions and results in incomplete
analysis of fishery management policy.

Two marine sportfishing surveys were conducted during 1994 in the
Northeast Region (Maine to Virginia).  Data from the surveys provided
demographic and economic information on marine recreational fishing
participants and nonparticipants.  In an earlier report (Steinback and O Neil)
the socioeconomic characteristics, recreational fishing preference and
perceptions of current and prospective fishery management regulations were
documented for a sample of saltwater recreational anglers that were on
intercepted fishing trips.  This report serves as a companion to the Steinback
and O Neil report.  The purpose of this report is to document the
socioeconomic characteristic or recreational fishing participants and
nonparticipants from a sample of households in the Northeast Region. 
Additionally, the results of a statistical model to project recreational
fishing participation rates are reported and forecasts of recreational fishing
participation to the year 2010 are developed for each of the 10 states in the
study.

A general equilibrium demand curve is appropriate for measuring the
surplus changes in several markets induced by a policy intervention in one
market. Guidelines for the identification and consistent estimation of such a
demand curve are discussed.  Specifically, conditions are stated under which
the dropping of prices of related goods yields a consistent estimate of the
slope of the general equilibrium demand curve.  Also, a method similar to
Leamer's is proposed to provide consistent bounds for the general equilibrium
demand slope when the slope is underidentified.

the distribution of income itself appears in individual utility functions.  In
short, the income distribution meets all of the tests of a pure public good. 
Exclusion is impossible, consumption is nonrival; each individual must consume
the same quantity.  The same problems also occur.  Each individual has a
vested interest in disguising his preferences concerning his desired income
distribution to avoid paying his optimal share of the necessary transfer
payments.

Several hundred marine reserves now exist and their number is growing. 
The demand for additional marine reserves can also be expected to grow,
especially since they seem to be relatively undersupplied compared to
terrestrial biosphere reserves.  Basic socioeconomic reasons are given to why
governments should establish marine reserves.  Management problems are
illustrated by reference to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) governing of Title
III of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.  The nature,
clarity, and precision of objectives as set out in legislation are discussed,
and the importance for management of public and political support is
considered.  Using economic analysis, an approach different to that used by
some ecologists for determining the optimal size of reserves is outlined and
the view of Soule' and Wilcox favoring many large reserves is modified.  The
natural difficulties involved in mandating marine reserves are highlighted by
comparison with land based parks.  Zoning and multiple use are common features
of marine reserves and require important management and policy decisions to be
made about optimal (or at least satisfactory) zoning and multiple use
arrangements.  Issues that ought to be taken into account and techniques for
making such decisions are discussed, and it is suggested that there should be
greater input from the social sciences in the management of marine reserves.

As almost uniform experience in fisheries managed by limited entry has
been the increased use of capital by each firm.  This is widely regarded as an
undesirable loophole in programs to limit fishing effort.  Closer examination
indicates that the increased use of capital by firms is produced by at least
six different incentives.  Moreover, not all of these incentives are
economically undesirable.  The net effect of ""capital stuffing"" is ambiguous
and can only be evaluated empirically.

A number of studies have used the American lobster fishery to raise

yield-effort models.  The present research shows that both published variants
of the Schaefer yield-effort model are poor predictors of landings in the

fishery make the Beverton-Holt dynamic pool model more appropriate to the
lobster fishery than the Schaefer yield-effort model.

environment affects the success of limited entry plans, (4) limited entry has
generated economic benefits more often by reducing short run externalities
than by eliminating long run stock externalities, (5) no evidence exists that
weak limited entry plans evolve into strong, successful plans, (6) the rents
created by limited entry are often politically problematic, and (7) the rights
under restricted access have proven to be quite different from the terrestrial

social costs of managing a fishery.
Townsend, Ralph E.  (1995).   Transferable Dynamic Stock Rights.   Marine
Policy, 19(2)153-158.
Individual transferable quotas (ITQs), while solving many short run
externalities, provide limited incentives for individual fishers to conserve
the resource.  All decisions that determine harvests are made by the
government, and the shares of future harvests that are allocated to any
particular fisher are not affected by that fisher s actions.  For example,
there is no incentive for the individual fisher to avoid catches of smaller
fish.  In fact, the incentives for discarding and high grading may be worse
under ITQs than under other forms of management.  This analysis proposes a
 transferable dynamic stock right  (TDSR), under which rights are allocated to
fishers as life cycle shares  of each year class that can be harvested.  Year
class allocations would change each year to reflect catches, growth and
natural mortality.  Allocations of newly recruited fish would be in proportion
to the share of the rights to the breeding stock held by each fisher.  Under
TDSRs, the fisher would internalize the economic decision about whether to
catch a given year class as small fish or as a larger tonnage of large fish. 
TDSRs provide the fisher with incentives to harvest in ways that maximize the
value of the catch from a given year class.

A true property rights scheme, a fishery trust, is proposed.  A fishery
trust is a corporation that has comprehensive management authority.  The
fishery trust is owned through corporate ownership rules.  Owner shares in the
trust are distributed initially to some group, who then vote those shares to
determine the fishery governance structure.  Shares are freely transferable. 
The responsibility of the trust would be comprehensive, including679responsibility for the cost of administration and enforcement as well as
management decisions.  Because the ownership rights in the trust are permanent
and transferable, owners have every incentive to husband the resource. 
Although comanagement has been suggested as a vehicle for greater fisher
involvement in management, a corporate ownership structure has long term
incentives that are clearly superior to those under collective or cooperative
management rules.

In 1982, a survey was initiated to obtain daily catch and effort data on
fishes commonly caught by charterboats in the southeastern United States. 
Boat effort and king mackerel CPUE data obtained from 1982 through 1985 were
analyzed.  The offshore fishing zone (>10 fathoms) received the highest amount
of trolling and other fishing (nontrolling) efforts; the nearshore fishing
zone (<=10 fathoms) received the second highest trolling effort and lowest
other fishing effort; the estuarine fishing zone received the lowest trolling680effort and the second lowest other fishing effort.  Data to evaluate seasonal
fluctuations in fishing effort were provided for 15 areas of the southeastern
United States and for the U.S. Caribbean.  Annual CPUE of king mackerel by
other fishing was much lower than trolling for most areas and years. CPUE was
higher in the nearshore or offshore zone than in the estuarine zone for all
area year combinations except North Carolina in 1983.  CPUE values were
highest in the nearshore zone about as often as in the offshore zone.  Highest
catch rates occurred in areas in both the U.S. south Atlantic and gulf of
Mexico when all years were evaluated; high catch rates occurred in North
Carolina, Georgia, northwest Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.  Seasonal patterns
of CPUE along the U.S. south Atlantic coast varied among areas in such a way
as to show that a temperature dependent migration (north in the warm months
and south in the cold months) was not indicated; king mackerel were high in
abundance off North Carolina and the southern areas of Florida in late fall
and early winter.  In the Gulf of Mexico, it appeared that in the spring and
early summer some groups of king mackerel simultaneously migrated northward
along the east and west Gulf of Mexico coasts.  Highest CPUE for king mackerel
occurred in 1983 or 1985 when all areas were considered.  Evaluation of the
historical data bases in northwest Florida indicated cyclical patterns of
abundance over a 20 year period.

The expansion of national fisheries jurisdiction to the two hundred mile
limit enabled maritime nations to allocate increased shares of the fish catch
off their shores to their own fishermen.  The Atlantic groundfish catches of
Canada and the United States are sold primarily on the American market.  A
Nerlovian inventory adjustment price expectations model is estimated for the
American demand for groundfish.  Income and price elasticities are perverse. 
The ability of the American market to absorb the increased anticipated catches
are therefore limited, and benefits of extended fisheries jurisdiction will be
lost unless marketing arrangements are substantially changed.

There is empirical and theoretical evidence indicating that quota
induced high grading is a problem in weight based ITQ programs.  This paper
examines value based ITQ programs as a possible solution to this problem.  It
is shown that value based ITQ programs do not provide an incentive to high
grade and may achieve a target harvest with greater accuracy than weight based
ITQ programs.  Two ways of administering value based ITQ programs are
suggested.  Though both are arguably more difficult to administer than a682weight based ITQ program, a value based ITQ program may be less complicated
that a weight based ITQ program coupled with the sorts of taxes, landings
restrictions, or multiple quotas, that have been proposed as remedies for

The halibut fishery is one of the oldest commercial fisheries in the
North Pacific, dating back to the 1890's.  In Canada, as in most competitive
fisheries around the globe, by the late 1980's the halibut fishery was
becoming increasingly unsafe, overcapitalized, wasteful, and difficult to
manage.  As the number of fishing days diminished annually, product quality
worsened, and landed price fell, fishermen started wondering if there was not
a better way to manage the halibut fishery.  Their quest for an alternative
management approach for the halibut fishery resulted in the implementation of
individual quotas in 1991.
This presentation will discuss the Canadian Pacific halibut fishery
before and after the introduction of individual quotas.  The presentation
addresses the problems and concerns in the fishery that led to a change in
management, provides details of how the program was implemented, and describes
the benefits of the system to date.
Turvey, Ralph (1964).  ""Optimization and Suboptimization in Fishery
Regulation.""  American Economic Review , 56:207-218.
The purpose of this article is to show that fishery regulation is one of
those spheres of economic policy where what is the best thing to do depends on
what can be done.  What follows is a static analysis of a single trawl fishery
where there is only one fish stock, fished from ports that supply a common
competitive market and that are equidistant from the fishing ground with free
and easy entry by new firms.  The purpose is to provide an interesting and
important example of the notions of optimization and suboptimization and of
the proposition that coping with external diseconomies will sometimes involve
interfering with the nature as well as the scale of private productive
activities.

general categories.  Those relating directly to the Gulf shrimp harvesting
sector and those relating to other natural and human-induced changes occurring
in the Gulf of Mexico coastal zone.  The seven basic problems are:
overcapitalization and overcapacity, incidental bycatch, overfishing, habitat
loss, management/enforcement problems and gaps in research, increasing imports
that are competing with domestic production, and introduction of alien species
of shrimp or viruses.  Problems in research and management may be tied to both
of these categories.

Nonlinear Regressions on the Von Bertalanffy Growth Curve Using
Data with Unequal Numbers at Age.""  Draft report, National Marine
Fisheries Service, Beaufort Laboratory, 101 Pivers Island Road,
Beaufort, North Carolina.
When estimating parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve from
length-at-age data for marine fishes, often most length measurements are from
younger fish, with fewer measurements of older fish.  Plots of observed and
predicted lengths or comparisons of the estimated parameter L "" with maximum
lengths observed may suggest that poor estimates of L "" were obtained.  In this
study, growth in length of individual fish was simulated from a von
Bertalanffy growth curve with known parameters, with the number of fish
sampled at each age depending on the instantaneous mortality rate, Z.  Methods
of weighted nonlinear regression, applied to simulated growth data, included:
(1) unweighted; or weighted by the inverse of (2) the numbers of fish measured
at each age (1/N i), (3) the standard error of the mean length at each age
(1/SEi), and (4) the estimated standard deviation in length at each age (1/ Ã). 
Less accurate and precise estimates of L "" and K were obtained with increasing
Z for all weighting methods; except for large K, when more accurate parameter
estimates were obtained with increasing Z.  Weighting by 1/N i yielded more
precise estimates of the growth parameter than the other weighting methods. 
In practice, the advice of looking for patterns in the residuals should be
followed before making the final choice among estimation methods.

Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Fisheries Center, Beaufort Laboratory, Beaufort, North Carolina.
The status of the North Atlantic swordfish resource is considered using
production model analysis.  Sensitivity of the production model fits to stock
hypotheses, model parameters, and equilibrium assumptions as well as error in
measures of effective effort are considered in the analysis.  When the catch
and effort time series is of short duration compared to the life span of the
fish species (as with swordfish), simulation results suggest that traditional
production model fits to data representing non-equilibrium (transitional)
conditions in a fishery may give spurious results and can form a poor basis
for management decisions.

The problems associated with improving fuel efficiency in the Gulf and

the data necessary to do an adequate job of designing fuel efficient
technologies for each vessel do not exist since they were not constructed in

formation of a number of task forces and delivery mechanism that should
provide adequate information to allow each individual vessel owner to make
appropriate decision on fuel saving technologies that affect him.

Improving the Link Between Fisheries Science and Management:
Biological, Social, and Economic Considerations, International
Council for the Exploration of the Sea, St. John's, Newfoundland,
Canada, September, 14 pp.690The bycatch of juvenile fish can be a major problem in fisheries with
small meshed trawls, such as fisheries for shrimp, ( Pandalus  borealis ).  A
sorting grid that effectively removes most of the undersized fish has been
developed for shrimp trawls and it is not legal to fish for shrimp in the
Barents Sea without the use of this sorting grid.  Apart from this, the
existing catch regulation of the shrimp fishery in the Barents Sea is the
closing of shrimp fisheries on fishing grounds when the bycatch of juvenile
fish exceeds the criteria for allowable bycatch in numbers per ton of shrimp
set by the Norwegian - Russian Fishery Commission.
In this paper, a new method for the calculation of a criteria for
closing shrimp fisheries based on both biological and economic considerations
is established.  This bioeconomic approach is an alternative to the existing
biological approach.  The main concept in the bioeconomic approach is that if
the expected future value of the bycatch exceeds the value of the shrimp
catches, the shrimp fishery should be closed.  In this paper, a joint criteria
for allowable bycatch is developed and calculated, including all the
commercially interesting species whose juveniles are caught as bycatch in the
shrimp fisheries in the Barents Sea.
Vestergaard, Niels (1996).   Discard Behavior, Highgrading, and Regulation:
The Case of the Greenland Shrimp Fishery.   Marine Resource Economics ,
11(4):247-266.
A formal economic analysis of the discarding problem is presented,
focusing on the individual fisherman and the effect of different regulations
on the fisherman s incentives to discard.  If the marginal trip profit of an
extra fishing day is greater than the average trip profit in a nonregulated
multispecies or single species/multisize fishery constrainted only by the hold
capacity and the length of the season, the fisherman may have rational
incentives to discard/highgrade.  Regulation by TAC does not change the
incentives to discard.  However, under individual nontransferable quotas
(INTQs) and individual transferable quotas (ITQs), the incentives to discard
increase.  The incentives to discard decrease under ITQs compared to INTQs, if
the unit quota price is smaller than the shadow price of the quota.  The model
is applied to the Greenland shrimp fishery, where it demonstrates the reported
discard behavior in the fishery.  Finally, different regulations of discard
are applied and discussed in the model.  The analysis suggests that regulation
of fishing days could be a promising alternative to usual suggested measures
like tax/subsidies and landings obligations.

U.S. shrimp landings and use fell slightly in 1990.  Use was up slightly
for Japan, Europe, and the world.  Prices and production problems continued to
plague shrimp farms that accounted for most of the growth in world supplies
over the past decade.  Shrimp fishermen faced problems too.  Whether the price
strength of larger shrimp will be overcome by supplies of farmed black tiger
shrimp over the long haul as in 1988-89 is unclear, but along with the long-

Permit data, while imperfect, is the only means to describe boats in the
commercial mackerel and some other managed fisheries.  Among the 6,177 boats
with federal fishing permits in 1996, net income could be computed for 3,045
boats.  Using medians, the average boat was 31 feet, 240 horsepower, grossed
$19,000 from fishing, incurred $13,000 in fishing expense, and had about
$4,000 in net income from fishing. In 1996, 3,432 boats had permits for
commercial fishing for mackerel.  For the most part, they engaged in more than
one fishing activity, three or four on average, according to cross-tabulations
of boats by permit, fish sold, or gear used.  Using data on fish sold and gear
used as a qualitative indicator of participation in commercial fishing for
king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, or both, an estimate of 40 to 2900 boats is
obtains, compared with 3,432 boats that had permits.

Conditions were favorable for offshore brown shrimp production in the
vicinity of the Texas and Louisiana boundary when there were strong northward
winds and eastward Ekman transport during the winter, followed by a dry
spring.  These conditions may have resulted in higher survival rates for
postlarvae and juvenile stages in the estuaries.  High springtime river
discharges and resulting low salinity in nursery areas reduced offshore brown
shrimp yields regardless of wind direction.
White shrimp landings were positively correlated with summer river
discharges in the region.  Strong winds toward the northwest and northeast
Ekman transport in the spring and summer during periods of spawning and larval
transport into nursery areas correlated with decreased offshore yields of
white shrimp.  In the fall, strong easterly winds, low river discharge and
relatively cold water temperatures correlated with increased offshore white
shrimp landings.

This paper examines group behavior in an experimental environment
designed to parallel the conditions specified in noncooperative models of
limited access common pool resources.  Using experimental methods, we
investigate the strength of theoretical models that predict that users of such
resources will appropriate units at a rate at which the marginal returns from
appropriation are greater than the marginal appropriation costs.  Our results
confirm the prediction of suboptimal accrual of rents and offer evidence on
the effects of increasing investment capital available to appropriators.

Reduction in Recreational Shrimping.""  Northeast Gulf Science ,
13(2):139-144.
Bycatch from recreational shrimping is estimated by quantifying the
catch from fishery independent trawling and through a survey of licensed
recreational shrimpers in Alabama during 1990.  Paired trawls are used to test
tow net modifications (fish shooter and Florida fisheye) for bycatch
reduction.  The mean fish bycatch was 5.4 kilograms per 20 minutes tow and
contained 426 fish primarily from three families (Sciaenidae, Engraulidae, and
Clupeidae).  The total recreational shrimping effort for Alabama was an
estimated 37,244 hours resulting in a potential fish bycatch of 603,000 kg or
47.6 million fish.  The fish shooter did not significantly reduce the bycatch
in either weight or numbers while the Florida fisheye significantly reduced
bycatch in Both weight (26 percent) and number (46 percent).  Further testing
of the Florida fisheye with the position of the nets reversed revealed no
significant reduction in weight but a significant reduction in bycatch number
(36 percent).697Wallace, Richard K., William Hosking, and Stephen T. Szedlmayer (1994).

profit under the assumption that national quotas can be traded and that stable
national quotas is a political goal.  As an example we use the Norwegian purse

Available data are often inadequate to discriminate among alternative
models that make different predictions about the consequences of allowing
escapement outside the range of recent historical experience.  Dynamic
programming is used to show that the optimum policy in such situations can
involve active probing or experimentation with escapements.  The optimum
adaptive policy is usually difficult to compute, but generally may be closely
approximated by a ""Bayes equivalent"" policy that is simpler to estimate but
does not account explicitly for the value of information associated with
allowing more extreme escapements.  While there are various practical
difficulties in estimating and implementing an optimum policy, it is concluded
that regular probing experiments should be included in every fishery
management plan.
Walters, Carl J. and Ray Hilborn (1976).  ""Adaptive Control of Fishing
Systems.""  J. Fish. Res. Board Can. , 33:145-159.
This paper discusses some formal techniques for deciding how harvesting
policies should be modified in the face of uncertainty.  Parameter estimation
and dynamic optimization methods are combined for the Ricker stock-recruitment
model to show how exploitation rates should be manipulated to give more
information about the model parameters; in general, harvesting rates should be
lower than would be predicted by the best fitting recruitment curve unless
this curve predicts that the stock is very productive.  A decision procedure
is developed for comparing alternative stock-recruitment models; when applied
to the Fraser River sockeye salmon ( Oncorhynchus  nerka), the procedure
indicates that an experimental increase in escapements would be quite
worthwhile.  It appears that there is considerable promise for extending these
methods and procedures to cases where the stock size is unknown and where
fishing effort is poorly controlled.698Wang, Der Hsiung, Louis J. Goodreau, and Joseph J. Mueller (1986). 
""Economics of Atlantic Sea Scallop Management.""  Marine Resource
Economics , 3(2):111-135.
We present a brief discussion of the Atlantic sea scallop fisheries, a
12 equation model, and an evaluation using the model of management strategies
proposed by the New England Fishery Management Council.  The demand for sea
scallops at all market levels is price inflexible.  Income price flexibility
is positive but less than 1 for demand at all market levels.  Cross price
flexibility is positive but also less than 1 and is approximately the same for
demand at all market levels (between 0.36 and .037).  In general fishing
effort elasticities for each fishing area with respect to scallop abundance
for that area are larger than 1.  Effort elasticities with respect to ex-
vessel price are 0.42 and 0.32 for the New England fleet's effort to the South
Channel and eastern Georges Bank fishing areas, respectively.  The partial
elasticity of production with respect to inputs is higher for scallop
abundance than for fishing effort in all Georges Bank resource areas. 
Reduction in fishing effort or in meat count would accrue positive benefits to
the sea scallop industries and consumers, and the greater the reduction in
effort and/or in meat count, the larger the benefits under long term
equilibrium conditions.  However, the short term economic impacts of the
various management strategy scenarios are generally the reverse of the long
term benefits.

An econometric model for the wholesale and ex-vessel markets of American
lobster, Homarus  americanus , was developed to determine the market impact of
proposed increases in the minimum size for American lobster.  Prices were
found to be inflexible with respect to landing, imports, and income (i.e., the
price flexibilities were less than one) in both wholesale and ex-vessel
markets.  The size of lobster has a statistically significant effect on
wholesale and ex-vessel prices and revenues.  On average, wholesalers pass
along 52% of any price changes to lobstermen.  The ex-vessel price impact of a
given change in supply is about the same as for changes in either landings or
imports.  Any changes in public policies leading to increases in total
landings of American lobster and/or decreases in the proportion of small
lobsters in the landings would result in increases in gross revenues to
fishermen and wholesalers.  While the long term impact would be favorable, the
short term market impact of increases in the minimum size for lobster would be
uncertain.

Relative to the limited entry program, the ITQ system shrank the offshore surf

productivity increased by 46% to a record level in 1991 as the fleet reduced

surf clam and quahog resources were worth $84 million and generated resource
rents to the original ITQ owners of $14 million.  Seasonal supply patterns
showed market distortion under the limited entry system.  The surf clam ex-

Hof and King (1982) develop an improved and simplified method for
estimating the recreational benefits of a single new site given the existence
of a system of substitute and complement sites.  The authors essentially
conclude that when only one new site is involved, its benefits can be
evaluated without bias by merely estimating the demand function for that700single site, while accounting for the presence of substitutes (other site
prices).  This is as opposed to estimating the entire system of demand
equations, such as was done by Burt and Brewer (1971) and Cicchetti, Fisher,
and Smith (1976).  The  conclusion of Hof and King (1982) is important for
empirical work, for by use of their procedure, unbiasedness in benefit
estimates can be maintained while data requirements and associated costs are
greatly reduced since use data are required for only the site in question
rather than the system of sites.  The author agrees with the approach and adds
additional theoretical evidence to support it.  See Hof and King (1983) for a
reply.

Hedonic cost and revenue functions are estimated for the Gulf of Mexico

to 1980.  Comparable costs, revenues, and profits are estimated for three
vessel size classes for the Texas, Louisiana, and Florida inshore and offshore

generally been profitable over the time period of the analysis, exclusive of
opportunity costs.
Ward, John M. (1988).  ""A Synthesis of Cost and Revenue Surveys for Gulf

Since detailed cost data are not routinely collected and the published
survey data from various sources are not easily compared, trends in costs and
revenues for the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishing fleet cannot be readily
determined.  A consistent data set for comparing vessel operating costs and
revenues between states, vessel sizes, and years was estimated using weighted
least squares regression analysis.  Differences in the sample variance between
the published cost and revenue data caused by time, type of survey, region
surveyed, vessel size, sample size, or area of operation are accounted for in
the econometric model.  The coefficient of determination adjusted for the
degrees of freedom and the F statistic indicate that the model specification
provides a good statistical fit to the survey data.

The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishing fleet is modeled extending the
approach developed by Prochaska and Cato (1981) by including economic and
biological variables.  Changes in fleet size are found to be responsive to
economic and biological conditions in the fishery.  The model indicates that
the fleet size is approximately three times that necessary to efficiently
harvest the resource.  While the model is handicapped by insufficient degrees
of freedom, results suggest that alternative modeling approaches could be used
to develop a model that successfully predicts changes in fleet size.

The economic implications of adopting a bycatch reduction device in a
fishery that discards a fish species that is the focus of a directed
commercial fishery when demand is relative elastic and inelastic are
discussed.  The stock of the bycatch species collapses when the bycatch
reduction device increases the supply of fish in the directed fishery when
demand is relatively elastic.  This outcome is dependent on the assumptions of
the model that link fishing effort levels in the two directed commercial
fisheries.

Fisheries By Limiting Access  at Annapolis, Maryland, September 20-
22, 1992.
Often when economics is discussed, it is in terms of gross national
product, personal disposable income, number of jobs, and unemployment rates. 
While these are important outcomes of an economic analysis, they are not in
and of themselves economics.  Economics is the study of how scarce resources
are allocated amongst unlimited wants.  The scarce resources are the capital
stocks, the stocks of fish, and labor.  The unlimited wants include those of
commercial and recreational fishermen as well as final consumers of fish
products.  Allocation concerns the best use of all resources (capital, labor,
and fish) in the production of fishery products so that the return to society
is maximized. Economics provides the methodology by which the optimal levels
of the various inputs in the production process, such as labor, can be
determined.  For example, increasing the level of employment in a fishery702eventually leads to a decline in the productivity of labor and in the size of
the fish stock.  More importantly, the excessive use of labor in the fishery
deprives the marketplace of not only fish but the productive use of that labor
in another industry; leading to a reduced total level of production. 
Therefore, more jobs in a fishery are not necessarily better for the nation
since diverting labor to other industries could result in more products being
produced at lower cost.  Markets are considered to be economically efficient
when they produce the highest level of output at the lowest possible cost. 
Efficient markets are defined by clearly defined, transferable, and
enforceable property rights.  Markets tend to be inefficient where these
property rights are not clearly defined such as in open access fisheries.  By
applying the economic modeling framework to the fishery problem in cases where
property rights are nonexistent, management regulations can be evaluated to

Reduction Device as a Stock Conservation Management Measure."" 
Draft report submitted to the Journal of Marine Resource
Economics .
The proposed regulation to reduce bycatch and discarding of finfish in
the southeastern region is a gear modification that excludes finfish from
shrimp trawls.  This regulation is analyzed using a simple theoretical model
of a multispecies fishery whose bycatch is harvested in a directed fishery
consisting of commercial and recreational fishermen.  The costless reduction
in bycatch fishing mortality imposed on the multispecies fishery does not
result in an increased stock size for the bycatch fish species or a
substantial increase in its level of harvest.  Instead, the fish stock is
reallocated from the multispecies fishery to the fishery directed at the
bycatch species causing fishing effort to expand in the bycatch species
fishery that drives the stock size down to the previously existing equilibrium
level.  Recreational harvest and effort levels remain unchanged since the
model is linear in effort and the commercial fishery is given access to the
fishery first.

Access in Marine Fisheries."" In Karyn L. Gimbel (ed.) Limiting
Access to Marine Fisheries: Keeping the Focus on Conservation ,
Center for Marine Conservation and the World Wildlife Fund,
Washington, D.C.
Often when economics is discussed, it is in terms of gross national
product, personal disposable income, number of jobs, and unemployment rates. 
While these are important outcomes of an economic analysis, they are not in
and of themselves economics.  Economics is the study of how scarce resources
are allocated amongst unlimited wants.  The scarce resources are the capital
stocks, the stocks of fish, and labor.  The unlimited wants include those of
commercial and recreational fishermen as well as final consumers of fish
products.  Allocation concerns the best use of all resources (capital, labor,
and fish) in the production of fishery products so that the return to society
is maximized. Economics provides the methodology by which the optimal levels
of the various inputs in the production process, such as labor, can be
determined.  For example, increasing the level of employment in a fishery
eventually leads to a decline in the productivity of labor and in the size of
the fish stock.  More importantly, the excessive use of labor in the fishery
deprives the marketplace of not only fish but the productive use of that labor
in another industry; leading to a reduced total level of production. 
Therefore, more jobs in a fishery are not necessarily better for the nation
since diverting labor to other industries could result in more products being
produced at lower cost.  Markets are considered to be economically efficient
when they produce the highest level of output at the lowest possible cost. 
Efficient markets are defined by clearly defined, transferable, and
enforceable property rights.  Markets tend to be inefficient where these
property rights are not clearly defined such as in open access fisheries.  By
applying the economic modeling framework to the fishery problem in cases where
property rights are nonexistent, management regulations can be evaluated to
determine if they improve or exacerbate market efficiency.

A primary data collection effort was contracted for using MARFIN funds. 
A request for proposals was prepared and Resource Economics Consultants were
selected to interview and collect costs, returns, and bycatch information from
a sample of shrimp fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico.  Data was collected for
the three most current years of vessel operation in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp
fishery and combined with historic data from other sources.  Preliminary data
was analyzed to ensure that accurate information was collected and data entry
errors were minimized.  This information was then used to estimate a vessel
operating cost model.  This approach permits the estimation of costs and
returns for individual vessels in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery. 
Estimates of costs, revenues, and net revenues have been prepared and are
presented in the Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation Report for the Gulf

Paper presented at the Limited Access Workshop, Seattle,
Washington, November 1-3.  National Marine Fisheries Service,
Southeast Regional Office, St. Petersburg, FL.
Individual transferable quota programs that have been adopted in the
U.S. have allocated the fishing rights at no charge to the historical
fishermen.  As a result of subsequent trading in an ITQ market, the initially
free ITQ market shares and poundage coupons become valuable.  It is the
contention of this paper, however, that this increase in ITQ value reflects a
reallocation of resource rents from the quasi-fixed factor inputs of capital
and labor to a relatively more fixed factor input; the ITQ.  As a result, the
initial sale does not represent a windfall profit to the fisherman who was
initially allocated the ITQ, at least in fully developed or over developed
common property fisheries.

Conference, Norway.
Individual transferable quota (ITQ) prices are theoretically assumed to
affect prices and harvesting costs symmetrically.  In this analysis, the
incidence of two different ITQ programs on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shrimp
fishery are investigated.  First, the impact of the ITQ prices are assumed to
affect only the ex-vessel price of shrimp.  Second, the impact of ITQ prices
is assumed to affect only the harvesting cost per pound.  This empirically
based simulation model demonstrates that if the annual ITQ prices affect the
harvesting costs, net benefits to the vessel owners are reduced and crew share
increases substantially; suggesting that owners and crews would negotiate to
achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth generated by the adoption of
ITQ programs.  If the incidence of the ITQ regulations impact is on price, on
the other hand, then crew receives only a small increase in income and vessel
owner captures most of the increase in net benefits.  In both cases, fleet
size declines causing a reduction in capacity.

Open Access Fisheries.   FAO Fish Rights 99 Conference, 14-17 November,
Fremantle, Australia.
In ""A Critical Review of the Individual Quota as a Device in Fisheries
Management,"" Parzival Copes(1986)presents many sound arguments against the use
of individual quotas as a fishery management instrument citing the results of
actual applications.  While individual quotas are not useful in the fisheries
""rationalization"" process without transferability, transferability has
unsightly equity and income reallocation effects.  The question that remains
unanswered is whether ITQ's are preferable to the common property or open
access fishery scenario.  This question can be addressed by analyzing the
effect of adopting ITQ s in a computer simulation of a dynamic bioeconomic
model of the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery.  The computer simulation model is
based on empirical research conducted on the shrimp fishery, which developed
models of market supply and demand, fleet dynamics, and operating costs.  This
dynamic simulation model will also address the question of whether fisheries
with highly variable recruitment are appropriate subjects for ITQ management. 
Although a simulation model, the advantages of this approach are that the
actual behavior of a group of individual fishermen is the basis for the model,
various scenarios can be compared based on the same set of initial
assumptions, transition paths can be compared to long-run equilibrium
conditions, and an index based on the present value of net benefits can be
generated for open access, common property, and rights-based fishery resource
management.

The individual transferable quota (ITQ) program for wreckfish in the
south Atlantic was first implemented during the 1992-1993 season.  The program
has now entered its third year and so far no changes have been made to the
initial actions that established the ITQ program.  A monitoring program has
been tracking landings, shares and coupons transactions, among others and has
provided information to the stock assessment group that meets annually to
evaluate the status of the fishery.  This paper presents a brief background of
the fishery, the conception, development, and implementation of the ITQ
program.  Monitoring the progress of the program is vital to evaluating
whether it is fulfilling its objectives.  The use of socioeconomic data is
important not only for this process, but also in developing the ITQ program. 
A close look is given to the role socioeconomic data has played in this
process.  Some thoughts are provided on the lessons learned from this process
and to what types of socioeconomic data could improve future implementation of
ITQ programs.

respect to physical characteristics.  In this study, the investigators
developed a more effective and useful method of classifying vessels for costs
and returns analysis by the introduction of an index of fishing effort.  This
effort index is defined as the fishing power of any given vessel relative to
the fishing power of a base or standard vessel.  The results indicate that the
use of an effort index to establish relatively homogeneous groups of vessels
for costs and returns studies, that are needed by the industry and by agencies
responsible for management of the resource, constitutes an improvement over
use of a classification based on a single criterion such as length only.
Washington, Percy M. and Ann M. Koziol (1993).   Overview of the Interactions
and Environmental Impacts of Hatchery Practices on Natural and
Artificial Stocks of Salmonids.   Fisheries Research , 18:105-122.
Artificial propagation of Pacific salmon has been carried out for over a
century.  Salmonid stocks used in hatcheries were made homogeneous to be more
easily manipulated.  The stocks that form the basis for most coastal net and
troll fisheries are currently of hatchery origin, and a 3-5% escapement of
hatchery stocks is considered adequate for reproduction.  During the period
1960-1980, although numbers and average sizes of coho released from Columbia
River hatcheries increased, returning adults declined between 1970 and 1980. 
Massive efforts were made to improve the efficiency of production in salmon
hatcheries.  Adult biomass potential decreased where there was a proportional
increase in precociousness, resulting in decrease in older mature individuals. 
Fisheries based upon enhancement have consistently fostered the over-fishing
of naturally reproduced stock.  For reasons never satisfactorily explained,
salmonids have been released for decades in upstream areas without a basic
understanding of instream ecological requirements of the salmonids, a
knowledge of what resources these released salmonids are being superimposed
upon, or a concern for the ecological devastation caused by these practices. 
A policy based on artificial propagation served as an accomplice in reducing
wild salmonid stock genetic diversity among wild salmonid stocks and average
size and age of returning adults.  Fishery policy makers were provided a
convenient excuse for the worst possible resource use practices, and used
hatcheries to affect wild salmonid stocks profoundly.713Waters, James (1982).  ""Review of the 1982 Shrimp Fishery Along the

33149, March, 21 pp.
This report summarizes available information about the 1982 shrimp
fishery along the south Atlantic coast.  Four aspects of the fishery are
discussed in relation to historical trends: (1) ex-vessel value received by
commercial shrimpers, (2) landings, (3) productivity of commercial vessels and
(4) profitability.  Overall, 1982 was a good year for commercial shrimpers in
the south Atlantic, and the relatively mild winter of 1982-83 suggests that
1983 will be a good year as well.

the South Atlantic Snapper-Grouper Fishery.""  A Summary of Work
Performed for the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council,
National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Center,
Beaufort Laboratory, Beaufort, NC, January, 25 pp.
An objective of minimum size limits is to increase biomass landed by
harvesting fewer but heavier fish.  Biological yield per recruit models
adequately predict equilibrium yield per recruit with and without the size
limit, but they do not quantify the trade offs between short run losses and
long run gains in yield per recruit during the transition between equilibria. 
This study quantifies the transition between equilibria and suggests the
internal rate of return as a suitable criterion for evaluating the
effectiveness of a proposed minimum size limit.  In addition, two new
variables are introduced into the yield per recruit framework, one
representing the probability that undersized fish are caught and released and
the other defining the probability that a released fish will survive.  Minimum
size limits for ten species in the south Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery are
evaluated.

Gulf of Mexico, 1982.""  National Marine Fisheries Service,
Southeast Fisheries Center, Miami Laboratory, Miami, FL, August.
In 1982, commercial landings of snappers and groupers exceeded 21
million pounds worth approximately $25.8 million.  Grouper landings increased
from less than 5 million pounds in 1978 to a record 12.4 million pounds worth
a record $12.3 million in 1982, primarily due to the increased use of bottom
longlines.  In 1982, groupers represented nearly 59 percent of the commercial
snapper-grouper catch.  Red snapper landings increased from 4.5 to nearly 6
million pounds from 1978 to 1982, which reverses a long run decline that began
in 1966.  Red snapper landings were worth a record $10.2 million in 1982. 
Recreational fishermen harvest significant numbers of snappers, groupers, and
sea basses, but recreational catch data have not been available since 1979
when approximately 9 million fish were caught.

Trips in Inshore Waters.""  Draft report, National Marine Fisheries
Service, Southeast Regional Office, Beaufort Laboratory, Beaufort,
North Carolina.
A production function describes the relationship between inputs and
outputs.  The concept of a production function could be used to describe the
technology of the fishing firm or the technology of the entire industry. 
Empirical applications of fishery production functions usually have estimated
either an industry wide production function or an annual production function
for a representative vessel.  For example, Griffin et al. (1976) estimated an
annual industry production function for the shrimp fishery in the Gulf of
Mexico.  This study uses data from the inshore shrimp fisheries in Galveston
Bay and Calcasieu Lake to estimate catch per trip as a function of fishing
effort and some measure of population abundance or biomass as inputs.  Doll
(1988) discusses the fishery production function and its underlying
assumptions.

Management: Toward More Effective Regulation of Fishing Effort."" 
Marine Fisheries Review , 53(3):1-10.
This paper gives an overview of the economic rationale for limited entry
as a method of fishery management and discusses general advantages and
disadvantages of license limitation and catch rights as the two primary
methods of restricting access to marine fisheries.  Traditional open access
methods of regulation can be temporarily effective in protecting fish
populations, but they generally fail to provide lasting biological or economic
benefits to fishermen because they do not restrict access to the fishery.  The
general result of regulation with unrestricted access to a fishery is
additional,  ore costly and complex regulations as competition increases for
dwindling fishery resources.  Regulation that restricts access to a fishery in
conjunction with selected traditional methods of regulation would encourage
efficient resource usage and minimize the need for future regulatory
adjustments, provided that enforcement and monitoring costs are not too great. 
In theory, catch rights are superior to license limitation as a means of
restricting access to a fishery.

bay licenses in Galveston Bay and for trips with shrimp trawls in Calcasieu
Lake.  In one specification, catch per trip was estimated as a function of
hours fished, trawl width, vessel length and time as a proxy for the unknown
shrimp biomass.  Another specification estimated catch per trip as a function
of the number of tows per trip, average duration of each tow, trawl width,
vessel length and time.  These functions could be used in future analyses of
the proposal to require fishermen to limit their tow times to 90 minutes or

Biological investigations have determined that the red snapper ( Lutianus

This report describes economic implications of management alternatives to
govern the directed commercial and recreational reef fish fisheries and to
reduce the incidental catch and discard of juvenile red snappers and other
species by the shrimp trawl fishery.  Economic effects of various management
alternatives on the commercial and recreational red snapper fisheries were
based on projections of future landings made with a simulation model developed
by Goodyear (1989).  Economic effects of management alternatives on the
commercial shrimp fishery were based on the results of a simulation model
described by Griffin et al. (1990).  This report was reviewed by a panel of

February, 47 pp.
The North Carolina shrimp catch is composed of three different species,
brown ( Penaeus  aztecus ), pink ( P. duorarum ), and white ( P. setiferus ).  Brown
shrimp mature and are harvested in the fall.  During this same period the pink
shrimp are primarily in juvenile stages and are below commercial size. 
However, because they utilize the same areas, pink shrimp are caught
incidentally while harvesting brown shrimp and are killed.  Hence they are
lost to the fishery and represent foregone future earnings to the fishery
since they would otherwise have reached commercial size in late fall and719spring.  This incidental (or discard) catch problem is analyzed to ascertain
whether alternative shrimp management policies should be instituted that would
reduce the extent of the discard problem.  The basis for evaluating the
policies was whether or not net income to the fishery increased.  Because of
the lack of required data, the analysis was primarily a sensitivity analysis
on the parameters involved.  Results showed that the potential for increasing
income to the fishery through reduced discard exists only at high discard
rates.  This is primarily due to high natural mortality and the low
probability of catching those pink shrimp that are save from being discarded.

This survey provides basic economic information about the financial
performance of boats in the commercial reef fish fishery in the Florida Keys. 
Respondents were characterized with regard to their dependence on the
commercial reef fish fishery as a source of household income.  Boats were
described in terms of their physical and financial characteristics.  Some
boats fished in one kind of activity year-round whereas others rotated among
several kinds of fishing trips according to seasonal availability of fish,
seasonal variation in prices, fishery regulations and so forth.  An important
objective of the survey was to estimate average net operating revenues per
boat per trip and per boat per year that were earned on the most important
kinds of fishing trips taken by reef fish boats.  Yellowtail snapper was the
most commonly sought species by commercial reef fish boats in the Florida
Keys.  Spiny lobster was the second most frequently cited species as being
most important in terms of annual revenues, and generated the highest net
returns among the activities examined in this study. Black grouper and mutton
snapper were commonly mentioned as the second, third, fourth or lower ranked
species in terms of the generation of annual revenues, principally in the
Upper and Lower Keys.  Fishing for greater amberjack was the highest volume
activity examined in this study.  Overall financial performance was measured
as the boat's gross revenues and net income before taxes for all fishing
activities combined.  Net incomes per boat averaged $11,129 based on revenues
of $49,581 in the Upper Keys, $3,301 based on revenues of $13,714 in the
Middle Keys, and $6,653 based on revenues of $28,027 in the Lower Keys.  The
estimated total revenues for the sampled population of reef fish boats in the
Keys were $18.4 million, with aggregate net incomes of $4.3 million.

This study summarizes the results of a survey designed to provide economic
information about the financial status of commercial snapper-grouper boats
with home ports between Dare County, North Carolina and Dade County, Florida. 
A survey questionnaire was administered in the summer and fall of 1994 by
interviewers in face-to-face meetings with owners or operators of randomly
selected boats.  Fishermen were asked for background information about
themselves and their boats, their capital investments in boat and equipment,
and about their average catches, revenues and costs per trip for their two
most important kinds of fishing trips for species in the snapper-grouper
complex during 1993.  Respondents were characterized with regard to their
dependence on the commercial snapper-grouper fishery as a source of household
income.  Boats were described in terms of their physical and financial
characteristics.  The different kinds of fishing trips were identified by the
species that generated the greatest revenue and grouped into six general
categories: trips for temperate, mid-shelf species; trips for tropical
snappers; trips for deep water groupers and tilefish; trips with pots for
black sea bass; trips for greater amberjack; and trips for king mackerel. 
Average catches, revenues, routine trip costs and net operating revenues per
boat per trip and per boat per year were estimated for each category of
fishing trips.
This survey constitutes the first, comprehensive source of baseline
information about the financial status of snapper-grouper boats along the
Atlantic seaboard.  In addition to its descriptive value, data collected
during this study will aid in future examinations of the economic effects of
various regulations on commercial snapper-grouper fishermen.

also can be used to reduce finfish bycatch by employing a finfish deflector

taking advantage of the difference in swimming ability and behavior between
finfish and shrimp.  Shrimp are carried into the cod end by accelerating water
flow through the device with a webbing funnel.  Finfish are stimulated into an
escape reaction by a finfish deflector grid and are guided to exit openings by
leading panels.  Finfish separation rates averaging 78 percent and 53 percent
were achieved during day trawling and night trawling, respectively, with no
significant difference in shrimp catch rates.  Finfish separation rates varied
by species and total separation varied as a function of catch composition.

bycatch reduction/shrimp retention test results for prototype bycatch
reduction device (BRD) designs.  Fish bycatch and shrimp retention data are
presented for 30 prototype BRD designs.  Of these, 12 have demonstrated
overall fish bycatch reduction rates between 43% and 67% and 7 had shrimp
retention rates between 90% and 100%.  Prototype designs that show the best
potential for achieving a 50% reduction in total fish bycatch with better than
90% shrimp retention are the large mesh funnel design, the extended funnel
design, the HSB design, and the fisheye design.
Watts, Noel H. and Gilmore J. Pellegrin, Jr. (1982).  ""Comparison of
Shrimp and Finfish Catch Rates and Ratios for Texas and Louisiana."" 
Marine Fisheries Review , 44(9-10):44-49.
A comparison was made between 1980 and 1981 commercial fishing to judge
effects of the Texas closure on shrimp and finfish catches off Texas and
Louisiana.  Historical data (1973-78) for the two areas was used as baseline,
and comparisons were made of finfish/shrimp catch ratios and species
composition.  Mean shrimp catch rates (heads-on) standardized to 100-foot
trawls for Texas and Louisiana in 1980 were 42.56 pounds/hour and 42.53
pounds/hour, respectively, and in 1981 were 89.03 pounds/hour and 62.20
pounds/hour.  Mean finfish catch rates for Texas and Louisiana in 1980 were
333.90 pounds/hour and 242.84 pounds/hour, respectively, and in 1981 were
156.19 pounds/hour and 408.88 pounds/hour.  Average finfish/shrimp ratios for
Texas were 12.94 in 1980 and 2.55 in 1981.  For Louisiana, the average
finfish/shrimp ratios were 22.15 in 1980 and 37.23 in 1981.
Differences between 1980 and 1981 shrimp catch rates off Texas and
Louisiana, and between Texas and Louisiana in 1981, were significant at the 95
percent confidence level.  Finfish catch rates off both states were
significantly influenced by depth, with no significant differences found
between years for either state when the effect of depth was removed.  Species
composition of the bycatch was removed.  Species composition of the bycatch in
waters 10 fathoms or less was relatively consistent regardless of state or
year.  The composition of bycatch from deeper waters was much more variable
and significantly different from catches made in the shallower waters. 
Overall, the analyses supported a hypothesis of increased shrimp catch rates
due to the Texas closure.  Finfish catch rates and compositions, however, were
not shown to change as a result of the closure.  This latter conclusion
assumes the distribution of fishing effort by depth zone was unaffected by the
closure.

22(3):554-577.
Criteria are developed to evaluate recent theories of roll-call voting
in the House of Representatives.  Since tests of these very different theories
find high levels of predictive success, we must decide how to choose among
them.  Baseline models are developed to show the extent to which the votes
could be predicted with minimal information.  The 80-90 percent of the
individual votes correctly predicted by the theories is found to be little
improvement over the baseline models predicting voting along with the House or
party majority.  Since the statistical criterion is found to be indeterminate,
the importance of verisimilitude to the process being studied is stressed. 
Simulation studies have done a good job of portraying the process aspects, and
they could be usefully combined with statistical studies of long term forces
and interviewing studies of short term forces affecting the voting.  Theory
development in the field should move to a more longitudinal perspective, as
well as combining the long term and short term elements into a single
overarching theory.

Cultural Understandings and the Limits of Human Metaphor in
Devising Public Policy for Global Environmental Change.""  Presented
at the GSA Meetings, San Diego, California, October.
Scientific understanding of the earth's ecosystem has developed through
a series of successive metaphors or models, each of which has proved to be
more inclusive than its predecessors in explaining natural phenomena.  While
these metaphors or models help to extend our ecological understanding, it is
important to realize that a substantially different set of metaphors inform
the cultural beliefs and guide the collective behavior of human communities. 
In short, the gap between what people know and how they act can be quite725pronounced, and it can vary considerably from culture to culture depending
upon the institutional matrix and the vision of public leadership in any given
society.
The time-lag involved in the cultural appropriation of new scientific
knowledge becomes a critical issue in trying to devise appropriate public
policy for the global environment.  Human communities perceive problems and
devise public policies largely on the basis of metaphors derived from their
historical experience.  When confronted with new circumstances, the culturally
dominant metaphors available to guide and motivate action may prove to be
inappropriate or dysfunctional, engendering collective behavior that hastens
ecosystemic collapse rather than that which might preserve system-wide
integrity and continuity.  This paper examines some of the disparities between
emerging scientific models and the dominant cultural metaphors which continue
to condition the development of public policy on environmental issues.

This paper develops a formal model to characterize and compare the
alternative static allocations of resources that occur under conditions of
free access and of private property ownership.  There turns out to be a
definite limitation on the amount of inefficiency that can be introduced into
a competitive situation when property is freely accessible.  That bound has an
interesting welfare interpretation.  The variable factor will always be better
off with (inefficient) free access rights to the fixed factor than under
(efficient) private ownership of property.

80(4):750-764.
Delayed fishing fleet restructuring complicates the assessment of
efficiency gains from individual transferable quota (ITQ) fisheries management726programs.  This article presents a methodology to estimate harvest sector
efficiency gains in lieu of incomplete fleet restructuring.  The methodology
is applied to assess the efficiency gains in the Mid-Atlantic surf clam and
ocean quahog fishery ITQ program.  While roughly 128 vessels harvested clams
under the previous management regime, the analysis suggests that 21-25 vessels
will remain under ITQs.  The efficiency gains are estimated to be between
$11.1 million and $12.8 million annually (1990 dollars).

From Limited Entry to Transferable Quota: Non-Marshallian Principles for
Fisheries Management.   Natural Resource Modeling , 10(1):53-83.
Static analysis shows that individual transferable quotas (ITQs) can
dramatically increase economic efficiency comparable to a limited entry (LE)
management by releasing excess capital.  However, the transition from LE to
ITQ management presents further efficiency questions.  This paper shows that
the rate of retirement of excess capital is determined by the opportunity cost
of holding ITQ harvest rights on cost inefficient vessels. While restructuring
is immediate with perfect foresight delayed exit occurs with uncertainty and
low opportunity costs of holding ITQ.  Nearly cost-efficient fishers
anticipate increasing their payoff by waiting for higher ITQ prices, e.g.,
game theoretic principles rather than static Marshallian principles apply. 
The results raise policy questions about allocating ITQ to incumbent fishers
at no charge.  The Mid-Atlantic surf clam and ocean quahog fishery which
switch from LE to ITQ management in 1990 is analyzed as a case study.  Results
show that a large surplus was possible but unattained under LE management but
also that adjustment has been slow and costly, consistent with the results of
this paper.

fish and seafood.  We do so in an effort to illustrate the potential of this
area of research in the decisions that promote efficient use of the worlds'

on the issue at hand, quality of the data and skills of the researcher.  The
approaches are delineated by categorizing them either as demand analysis
studies following more traditional commodity analysis methods, or as market
research studies, following approaches used by the business marketing
profession.

 Toxic Algae Contamination and Demand for Shellfish: A Case Study of
Demand for Mussels in Montreal.   Marine Resource Economics , 10(2):143-

Toxic algae blooms are a worldwide phenomena, which appear to be
increasing in frequency and severity.  These natural events cause product
contaminations that often have significant economic consequences, including
supply interruptions due to closed fishing grounds, losses from human illness,
and losses due to a decline in demand for the affected products.  This paper
evaluates the impacts of a toxic algae bloom contamination event on demand for
unaffected shellfish.  As an empirical example of the economic losses the
shellfish industry experiences for these events, demand for mussels in
Montreal is estimated using firm level data and proxies for consumer
information, during and after domoic acid contamination of Prince Edward
Island mussels.  Sales losses due to decreased demand are calculated.728Implications of this issue for seafood safety and management policies are
discussed.

It is argued that ex ante willingness to pay is appropriately measured
as a function of subjective supply and demand probabilities.  An exploratory
case study of a loggerhead sea turtle protection programme is used to show how
estimates of these probabilities can be obtained from a sample survey and how
a change in probabilities determines contingent choice.  Empirical results
confirm that subjective probabilities are important when explaining ex ante
willingness to pay.  Attempts to estimate the determinants of ex ante
willingness to pay without controlling for subjective probabilities will
result in specification bias.  It is important that subjective probability
information is gleaned from contingent valuation survey respondents and
included in empirical models of contingent choice.

Mode choice models that combine both regional and behavioral aspects
were successfully developed and calibrated for the Chicago area.  The regional
aspects include the coverage of trip origins over the entire Chicago area and
the zonal nature of the data.  The form of the dependent variable, a dummy
indicating the mode chosen, and the analytic functions (logit and probit),
both yielding ""S"" shaped curves are the aspects of the models typical of
disaggregated and behavioral mode choice models.  Using a dummy for the
dependent variable solves the problem of errors in the dependent variable and
of aggregation over values of the independent variables.  Probit and logit
analysis restrict the value of the dependent variable suitably, and are
consistent with expected behavioral patterns.  The independent variables
chosen reflect characteristics of travelers, and of the modal options
available for a particular trip.

This paper examines the importance of hypotheses about fisherman
behavior for predicting, understanding, and designing efficient fisheries
regulation programs.  Particular attention is paid to flexible technology
fisheries where individuals are free to alter several dimensions of effort. 
It is suggested that the appropriate hypothesis of share-focused behavior
ensures that there will always be an incentive to combine inputs inefficiently
although technical conditions may limit or block the actual ability to do so. 
Some observations on the success of existing programs are also offered.

used to control allowable harvest.  Individual fishermen are assumed to make
decisions regarding potential fishing and capacity in light of how they
anticipate fellow fishermen and regulators to act.  An equilibrium occurs in
which there is excess capacity that is controlled at the fishery level to
ensure aggregate harvest targets are not exceeded.  Some discussion of
alternative mechanisms such as direct limitations or taxes on potential effort
and on individual fishermen is also presented.

This report summarizes an investigation of labor participation and
choices by fishermen involved in commercial fishing in California.  The
project arose out of both practical and basic questions about fishermen, their
labor markets, and their opportunities outside of fishing.  Little concrete
knowledge exists about fishing as an occupation and as an alternative or
complement to other nonfishing jobs.  Thus a primary objective of the study
has been to describe the fundamental nature of fishing as an employment
alternative on the Pacific coast.  A secondary objective has been to attempt
to measure alternative wages of fishermen who participate in Pacific coast
commercial fisheries.

This dissertation was designed to evaluate the current level of resource
use, determine the maximum sustainable and economic yield levels, and analyze
alternative lobster management programs.  Bioeconomic and firm harvest732analytical models were developed and estimated.  Maximum sustainable yield was
estimated to be approximately seven million pounds while maximum economic
yield was estimated to be 5.8 million pounds annually, slightly above current
levels.  Optimum levels of input use are 215 lobster firms each fishing 795
traps.  These levels require a 47 percent reduction in the number of firms in
the industry with no reduction in number of traps fished.  Specific management
programs considered in the analysis include licensing, quotas, and a harvest
rebate program.  For each program, maximum yield levels, costs, revenues and
profits were determined.  For the harvest rebate program alternative levels of
administrative costs and related sources of revenue were analyzed.

Laboratory during 1983.  The 1983 survey followed a pilot study in 1982 in
which nine captains, who conducted chartered fishing trips off the
southeastern United States coast, were contracted to provide daily records of
their catch and effort (Williams, Brusher, and Trent, 1984. NOAA TECh. Mem.

This paper develops an economic analysis appropriate to the biological

biological and social dynamics that are imperfectly understood and parameters
that are difficult to measure.   The argument (alien to traditional treatment
of fisheries economics) is that (1) the imperfections of our knowledge and the
uncontrollable variations in fisheries systems severely constrain the range of
economically feasible management options; (2) the social cost of rule making
and enforcement are high when a complex, uncertain, and highly variable
environment is the target of management; and (3) efficiency in this kind of
environment is much more closely related to the adaptive, learning behavior of
individual economic actors than to the traditional notion of input cost
minimization.

Draft report, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of

The Maine lobster fishery has long been described as a classic case of
over fishing; both biologically and economically.  To the discomfort of
standard management theory the fishery continues to produce high sustained
yields; in terms of biological performance it may be one of the best managed
fisheries in the world.   This result occurs without resort to limited entry735or individual transferable quotas (ITQs).  This paper argues there are strong
biological, social, and economic reasons to be skeptical that limited entry
will ever solve the fisheries conservation problem.  It suggests that the
reasons for the lobster fishery's continued success can be found in the
institutions of virtual user self-governance that have evolved over the years. 
Self-governance forces a consensus with regard to the kinds of rules used in
the fishery, assures wide-spread perception of their fairness and efficacy,
and leads to a situation where social sanctions are widely used for their
enforcement.  Self-governance in this fishery has led to mutual coercion,
mutually agreed upon and mutually enforced.

Marine Policy , 18(4):291-305.
For several decades, fisheries management has been based on stock
recruitment models, leading to policies designed to control the amount of
effort and the quantity of fish caught.  This approach has not been notably
successful.  In this paper we take the view that this problem arises from the
complex and likely chaotic nature of fisheries.  This attribute of fisheries
creates a very difficult and costly information problem, which renders
attempts to control the long term numerical abundance of individual species
virtually impossible.  We argue that feasible management must address the
relatively stable parameters of fisheries systems - habitat and basic
biological processes, and that this demands management attention to the fine
as well as the broad scale attributes of the system.  Attention to detail at
these differing scales implies the need for a layered or hierarchical
management structure.  The need to minimize information costs also suggests an
emphasis on decentralized, community based approaches to management.  A review
of the anthropological literature shows that such approaches are common in
many societies.

Conventional theory for the management of living ocean resources assumes
a predictable link between current management actions and the future state of
managed populations.  As a practical matter, however, it is very hard to
establish this kind of predictable relationship.  It is possible that the
dynamics of these populations exhibit chaotic variation.  This paper addresses
the question of appropriate management policies in a regime characterized by
chaotic population dynamics.  The problem is approached through a bioeconomic
simulator that has chaotic properties.  With light fishing, policies that
alter the conditions of fishing perform better than policies dependent upon
population predictions.  A lightweight paper that discusses the project in

Methodology.""  Presented at the International Conference on
Fisheries Economics, Os, Norway, May 26-28.
This paper attempts to explain, using neo-institutional economics, why
some of the most vaulted and comprehensive management programs have been
failures while others have been qualified successes.  It is argued that the
failures often occur with programs that take a more constructivist approach to
public management, proposing integrated solutions to common pool problems that
surpass the ability of managers and managed to foresee and predict outcomes.
Wilson, James R. and Rebecca Lent (1994).  ""Economic Perspective and the
Evolution of Fisheries Management Methods: Towards Subjectivist
Methodology.""  Marine Resource Economics , 9(4):353-373.
Some perspectives of neo-institutional economics are used to reexamine
the common pool fishery.  Applications of property rights theory in models
simulating the evolution of fisheries management suggest that even in the
presence of positive information and transactions costs (ITCs), resource users
may have incentives to sequentially negotiate rules of common pool use.  Such
a result might imply that fisheries managers should be more concerned with
ITCs than inefficiencies due to overcapitalization.  This impression is
further reinforced in collective choice examples taken from U.S. fisheries
management.  These comparative cases of public decision making in New England
and Alaska suggest that variations in the style of public management as well
as other aspects such as fleet heterogeneity might cause variations in
management effectiveness.  These variations in effectiveness may be related to
the ITC environment internal to the public agencies, as well as to the
external ITC environment they face.737Wilson, Robert R., Russell G. Thompson, and Richard W. Callen (1970).

A new conceptual model is needed to estimate the impact of demand,
supply, and marketing margins on retail food prices and farm prices.  This
model should be theoretically consistent with group behavior.  The present
study critiques past approaches to modeling farm to retail price spread
behavior, to emphasize the need for a larger framework for the analysis of
retail to farm linkages.  This enlarged model consists of reduced form retail
and farm price equations derived from the behavior relationships that
characterize aggregate output supply and input demand responses of the
marketing sector.  The model is then applied empirically to a set of eight
food commodities.  The results are generally consistent with theory that
indicates compatibility with competitive behavior and an aggregate constant
returns to scale technology of food processing.  The results also show the
need to allow for variable factor proportions between farm and marketing
inputs.  Farm level derived demand elasticities are more than 40 percent
larger than those obtained by assuming fixed proportions.

A total of 18,955 fish were tagged in an effort to obtain movement,
growth, and mortality characteristics of young Atlantic croaker ( Micropogon
undulatus ), Spot ( Leiostomus  xanthurus ), and Weakfish ( Cynoscion  regalis ). 
Samples were taken from trawler landed scrapfish.  Sixty-three species of fish
were identified.  Spot, croaker, and weakfish comprised 48.2% by weight of the
total scrap.  Seventeen edible species totaled 71.0% of the trawler discard. 
Comparison of landings and discard samples indicated that nearly 100%, 65%,
and 43% of landed spot, croaker, and weakfish, respectively, are discarded as
scrap.  Samples were collected to determine the ratio of discarded fish to
shrimp and the species composition of the fish discard.  Fifty-one species of
fish were identified in the samples.  Spot, croaker, and weakfish totaled
66.8% by weight of the discard.  Fifteen edible species accounted for 84.2% of
the discard.  The overall fish/shrimp discard ratio expressed in pounds was
determined to be 5.4:1.  The ratio for night samples was 46:1, while that for
day samples was 6.3:1.  Samples of spot, croaker, and weakfish were retained
during tagging operations for age analyses.  Forty-one percent of all spot,
49% of all croaker, and 81% of all weakfish discarded as scrap were 0 age.

The standard stochastic specification for a system of share equations is
obtained by assuming that the shares have a joint normal distribution with
means depending upon exogenous variables and a constant covariance matrix. 
This specification ignores the requirement that shares be between zero and
unity by giving positive probability to shares outside this range.  An
alternative stochastic specification involving the Dirichlet distribution,
that automatically limits shares to the unit simplex, is suggested.  A
comparison of results obtained from the two specifications is made using
sampling experiments and data from three different empirical studies.  The
sampling experiments and empirical applications show that the results are
generally quite close, thus providing some justification for the continued use
of the normal distribution specification in the estimation of share equations.

Surprisingly, the most distinctive characteristic of U.S. manufacturing

whether resource abundance reflected geological endowment or greater
exploitation of geological potential.  It was mainly the latter.
Wright, Sam (1981).  ""Contemporary Pacific Salmon Fisheries Management."" 
North American Journal of Fisheries Management , 1:29-40.
Successful salmon fisheries management requires effective data systems,
advance planning, well-supported spawning escapement objectives, dependable
population-size determinations and recognition of practical differences
between recreational and commercial fisheries.  Ocean fisheries must be
managed to ensure an escapement from the ocean that will support viable
""inside"" fisheries as well as meet spawning requirements, while the key to
commercial net fisheries management inside is the ability to make accurate,
in-season assessments of the runs.  A manager's primary client must be the
resource, not user groups.  In this context, an adequate surplus of fish is
required before a fishery is permitted rather than proof of overfishing before
a fishery is closed.  Management should normally attempt to maximize sustained
yields, but this can be legitimately modified by economic considerations in
both recreational and commercial fisheries management.  Management of mixed
stocks of hatchery and wild fish is a major challenge for today's manager who
needs to be directly involved in salmon-enhancement planning.
Yahaya, Jahara (1988).  ""Fishery Management and Regulation in Peninsular
Malaysia: Issues and Constraints.""  Marine Resource Economics ,
5(2):83-98.
In Malaysia, the official view held by fishery managers is that fishery
resources in the inshore waters (0-12 miles) have been biologically
overfished.  This has prompted the introduction of new management policies
such as license limitation, allocation of fishing grounds, and mesh size
regulation.  The paper examines a number of issues and constraints confronting
the implementation of these policies.  In most tropical fisheries countries
like Malaysia, these issues and constraints are more complicated than mere
operational difficulties (enforcement problems, bureaucratic inefficiencies,
etc.) commonly associated with fishery management in the developed countries. 
This stems from not only the dualistic nature of the Malaysian fisheries
sector - that is, large scale commercialized fisheries on the one hand, and
traditional small scale artisal fisheries on the other - but also the glaring
socioeconomic inequalities between the two.  Worse still, while the majority
of the commercialized fishermen are Chinese, the artisanal fishermen are
predominantly malays - and the New Economic Policy (NEP) seeks to reduce the
economic imbalance between races in the country.  The paper also examines the
potential effects of the license limitation, allocation of fishing grounds and741mesh size regulation policies on productivity of the individual fishermen,
employment, cost of fishing, and pressure on fish stock.

Community Based Fisheries Management.""  Presented at the

26-28.
In Japan, a fishing right is granted to a group of coastal fishermen who
are organized at the community level.  Such a fishing right system has been
developed over the past 250 years.  During this period there were three
fishery laws in effect.  Under the first two fishery laws (Ura and the old
fishery law), the fishing right was granted in an attitude that the government
was the resource manager.  Conversely, under the current fishery law,
fishermen are allowed to participate in the formulation of a coastal fisheries
management plan within a legal framework set out by the law.  This has given a
great motive to fishermen to create their own community based coastal
fisheries management systems.
Yamamoto, Tadashi (1995).  ""Development of a Community-Based Fishery
Management System in Japan.""  Marine Resource Economics , 10(1):21-
34.
The development of Japan s community-based fishery management system is
described.  Over the past 250 years, three fishery laws were in effect.  These
fishery laws commonly adopted a fishing rights system as a tool for coastal
fisheries management.  During the feudal era until 1867, the fishing right
system was used mainly to collect a fishery tax.  The fishing right system
established by the Old Fishery Law (1901-1947) helped to reduce conflicts
between fishermen exploiting the same resources with different gears.  The
Current Fishery Law, enacted in 1949, has led to  Territorial Use Rights in
Fisheries  by limiting its coverage to sedentary resources and non-mobile
gear.  At the same time, the Current Fishery Law created a system to establish
coastal fishery management plans through fishing rights and licenses.  These
innovations have motivated fishermen to create the community-based coastal
fisheries management system.  Since the inception of the Current Fishery Law
in 1949, the number of fishery management organizations created increased
annually to a total of 1524 in 1993.

Between the Capture Fishery and Aquaculture.   Marine Resource
Economics , 11(2):105-123.
This paper builds on the work of Anderson (1985a).  Interactions between
the capture fishery and aquaculture are modeled in two different cases: (1)
cultured fish has the same market value as wild fish, and (2) cultured fish
has only a substitute value for wild fish.  In agreement with Anderson s
conclusions, it is found that the entry of aquaculture lowers market price,
increases total supply, reduces fishing effort, and raises natural fish
stocks.  When culture cost is reduced in some way, the fish price will
decrease and fishing effort will decline.  This may represent another way to
reduce pressure on capture fisheries, with the advantage that the market
equilibrium has a higher supply and lower price than other effort control
measures.  The interactions in both cases are similar, but impacts of
aquaculture on price, supply, and effort in the second case are weaker than
the first.  Dynamic simulations are carried out and show more clearly the
process of dynamic iterations between the capture fishery and aquaculture.

In this paper, we consider a model in which fishing boats or firms share
the stock of fish in a fishing ground.  The catches made by each firm reduce
the stock available for the rest of the firms, which directly affects their
profits.  We aim to quantify in a static framework the gain in welfare
obtained by the firms if they decide to cooperate to attain an individually
rational efficient outcome.  One of the main results is that both the
incentives for the firms to cooperate and the minimum level of catches which
permits any gain in welfare decrease as real wage increases.  On the other
hand, the greater the asymmetry among boats or firms, the more difficult it
will be to reach any cooperative agreement.

direct fishery employment and income of individual crew are used in the
evaluation.  The implications for policy makers are discussed.
Yohe, Gary W. (1984).  ""Regulation Under Uncertainty: An Intuitive
Survey and Application to Fisheries.""  Marine Resource Economics ,
1(2):171-192.
This paper surveys the issues involved in setting or improving
regulatory activity in the presence of uncertainty.  It is conducted in a way
that will bring forth the underlying intuitions of the existing literature so
that the various policy options can easily be distinguished on grounds of
efficiency, as well as distributional and international considerations.  This
approach not only fits well into a section outlining the need for regulatory
review, but also provides a basis for suggesting the issues involved in
regulation fisheries.  Intuition more than modeling aids in initially applying
general analysis to specific areas, and the fisheries example illustrates how
that application can be scientifically accomplished.
Yohe, Gary W. (1991).  ""The Cost of Not Holding Back the Sea-Economic
Vulnerability.""  Ocean & Shoreline Management , 15:233-255.
A method for quantifying the economic vulnerability of developed
shoreline to the threat of greenhouse induced sea level rise is described and
applied to Long Beach Island, New Jersey, USA.  While the method carefully
accounts for structure, land and beach vulnerability along arbitrary sea level
rise scenarios from tax maps and careful geographical accounting, it does not
produce opportunity cost estimates for abandonment.  The data generated here
are, nonetheless, the foundation from which such cost estimates can be
constructed given market and individual reactions to subjective perceptions of
the threat and its timing.
Young, Richard H. (1982).  ""Strategy for Shrimp By-Catch Utilization."" 743FAO Fisheries Circular No. 745, Food and Agricultural Organization

This paper summarizes conclusions based on field experience gained in
various regions of the world on problems of bycatch utilization and on the
recommendations emanating from the Technical Consultation on Shrimp Bycatch
Utilization held in Georgetown, Guyana, 27-30 October 1981.  In view of the
considerable experience already gained, the paper proposes a strategy to
promote a fuller use of shrimp bycatch and outlines the objectives and the
structure of an initial two year coordinating project to achieve it.

Yucel, Mine Kuban (1989).  ""Severance Taxes and Market Structure in an
Exhaustible Resource Industry.""  Journal of Environmental Economics
and Management , 16:134-148.
This paper compares the effects of a severance tax on profit maximizing
competitive and monopolistic firms that explore and produce an exhaustible
resource.  The producers' response to the tax are studied and the deadweight
losses from the tax are calculated.  Time paths of exploratory effort,
extraction, and price are computed.  Severance taxes lead both producers to
reduce production and exploration and cause a shift in the time path for
prices.  The deadweight losses from the tax are low, especially in
competition.  The losses in the monopoly case are relatively higher, with the
tax burden falling mainly on the monopolistic producer.
Zarembka, Paul (ed.) (1974).  Frontiers in Econometrics .  Academic
Press, New York.
The contributions is this volume define a number of frontiers in
econometric theory.  Most of them illustrate with empirical applications.  It
is often through econometrics that theoretical hypotheses are confronted with
data, and it is often through econometrics that economists attempt to use
theory for purposes of quantitative policy.  While applied research cannot be
better than the underlying economic theory and available data, it also cannot
be better than statistical procedures utilized.
Zeckhauser, Richard (1981).  ""Preferred Policies When There is a Concern
for Probability of Adoption.""  Journal of Environmental Economics
and Management , 8:215-237.744A theory of effective policy choice is developed that recognizes that
the probability that a policy is adopted depends on who gains from it, who
loses, and by how much.  Ten pieces of recent environmental legislation are
assessed to see how mechanisms such as coupling with other legislation, phased
implementation, and the manipulation of uncertainty can spread benefits and
costs.  Several optimizing models are presented that explicitly incorporate
the probability of adoption.
Zeeman, E.C. (1974).  ""Levels of Structure in Catastrophe Theory

Catastrophe theory offers two attractions: on the one had it sometimes
provides the deepest level of insight and lends a simplicity of understanding. 
On the other hand, in very complex systems such as occur in biology and the
social sciences, it can sometimes provide a model where none was previously
thought possible.  This paper discusses various levels of structure that can
be superimposed upon an underlying catastrophe and illustrate them with an
assortment of examples.

Our discussion compares and contrasts responses of the two species to
single factors and their interactions, giving only limited literature
citations.  Implications for the two species are then explored.  The purposes
of this paper are to 1) provide, in an easily accessed tabular format,
representative information and literature sources relating environmental
factors to several inshore life stages of brown and white shrimp and 2) bring
attention to those factors, their interactions, and life stages for which
information is lacking.
Zellner, Arnold and Tong Hun Lee (1965).  ""Joint Estimation of
Relationships Involving Discrete Random Variables.""  Econometrica ,
33(2):382-394.
In this paper we present several models that have been utilized to
explain the variation of proportions.  For these models, we review single
equation estimation techniques that yield asymptotically efficient estimators. 
We then go on to consider the analysis of a set of correlated sample
proportions and develop a joint estimation procedure that yields
asymptotically efficient estimators.  The joint estimation procedure, by
taking account of heteroscedasticity as well as the correlations existing
between proportions, produces estimators with smaller asymptotic variances
than do single equation techniques that take account only of
heteroscedasticity.  Data on consumer decisions with respect to durable
purchases and use of instalment credit are analyzed to illustrate one use of
these techniques in economics.

Strategies for a Multiproduct Monopolist in a Discrete Choice Model.  
Draft Report, Oregon State University.
Supermarkets are multi-product sellers.  Under combined influences of
shopping complementarity, consumption complementarity and consumption
substitution, their pricing strategy could generate perfectly price-inelastic745input demands and cause a product s output and input prices to move in
opposite directions.  This may explain some observed behavior of seafood
processors.

A set of decision criteria for the choice between three popular
functional forms that have been employed previously in recreation demand
equations is presented.  The choice between linear and quadratic forms can be
made via conventional hypothesis testing procedures.  The Box and Cox
transformation procedure often allows choice between linear, semilog, and
other power transformations of the dependent variable.  The consequences of
the choice of a particular functional form on consumer surplus also are
investigated.

There has been no commercial harvesting of northern fur seals on the
Pribilof Islands, Alaska since the Interim Convention on Conservation of North
Pacific Fur Seals expired in 1948.  During 1985 and 1986, northern fur seals
were harvested on St. Paul and St. George Islands to meet only the dietary
(subsistence) needs of Aleut residents.  A summary of the 1985 subsistence
harvest on St. Paul Island is found in Zimmerman and Leacher (1986).  This
paper summarizes the 1986 harvest on St. Paul Island and contrasts the two
years.

The eight fishery management councils established by the Fishery
Conservation and Management Act of 1976 are mandated to manage U.S. marine
fisheries resources occurring in the fishery conservation zone based on the
concepts of maximum sustainable yield and optimum yield.  Fulfilling the
mandate requires a thorough understanding of these concepts.  It is the
purpose of this paper to present a nontechnical discussion of maximum
sustainable yield and optimum yield to facilitate understanding by the
councils, that are composed largely of laypersons, so that they may carry out
their duties under the Act.

Virginia Beach Drive, Miami, Florida.
There is no obvious method for relating sample size in terms of numbers
of fishing trips to be sampled to any quantitative measure or index of
efficiency which encompasses the totality of information on size, age, sex
composition, and distribution by time and area or to the estimate of yield per
recruit (YPR).  Estimation of the growth parameters and variances as well as
the YPR require nonlinear iterative solutions.  Further, given the greater
precision in estimation of the Gompertz growth parameters, considerable
improvement in estimating natural mortality would also be expected using the
same model.  The same is true of natural mortality.  Pauly (1980) used the
parameters of the von Bertalanffy equation to determine his empirical
relationship.  Similar methods using the Gompertz equation would likely result
in both improved accuracy and precision.  More importantly, variability in the
parameter estimates is a function of the unknown size (and age) distribution
in the population and the sample.  When so little is known, it is too early to
ask and impossible to answer how much better a 20% sample would be than a 10%,
etc.  The primary goal of the sampling design proposed here is to obtain a
representative sample of size, sex and age over the study area."

Notes / Assumptions: 
2017 TV inflation rate multiplier is actual
Uses 2016 millage rates - may see Headlee reductions again in 2017
Dexter Library capture ends six years after last renewal, per new State law.  Renewal approved by voters Nov 2016.
Wellness Center valuation is still in dispute and Tax Tribunal Case is being appealed.   Lower in 18-19 because parcel is now exempt, but assessed as building   
State Treasury sets inflation rate multiplier

Mayor’ s Thoughts  
Fire Station  Improvement Discussion  – at the March 26th City Council workshop, the idea  of moving the fire station to 
the MAVD property on Dexter Ann Arbor Road (across from Mill Creek Middle School) was discussed  by Council .  I have 
given a lot  of thought to the conversation that took place and would like to offer the following comments for Council 
and members of the public to consider:  
1. Moving the City of Dexter fire station from its current location to the Dexter Ann Arbor Road location will increase response times to the majority of the DAFD District by at least 2 minutes.  I don’t see any reason to do 
this.   Increased response times are  not in the best interest of the City or the two Townships that DAFD supports . 
2. If the station were relocated  to Dexter Ann Arbor Road, it would mean that approximately 350 runs to Dexter 
Township and over 300 runs to Webster Township would require the response from the City station to travel across approximately 80% of the City before it reached the borders of t hose communities.    This doesn’t make 
any sense.  
3. In order to get to Mast Road to get to Webster Township, Fire Trucks will have to travel down some combination 
of Inverness/Fourth/Central, Hudson/Fourth/Central, Edison/Fifth/Central, Hudson/Second/Central  or some 
other combination.  Most of these streets in the Original Village area were not designed as primary routes for 
fire trucks or rescue vehicles.   The right turns from Dexter Ann Arbor Road onto Inverness, Hudson, and/or 
Edison are all going to be very challenging turning movements for Fire Trucks, and all three require braking of a fire truck going down hill.  If there is another vehicle at these intersections waiting to turn, the fire trucks will have to slow down significantly and perhaps even wai t to make the turn.  
4. Many of the Old Village area streets do not have sidewalks (i.e. Second, Dover, Edison), which means fire trucks may be encountering more pedestrians in the streets during fire/rescue runs.  
5. Dexter Ann Arbor Road is a two lane roadway from Meadowview to Baker.  This will be the primary artery for 
Fire Trucks and rescue vehicles to travel to Dexter Township and Webster Township.   This road will see nearly 
800 runs or more per year  (over 650 to the Townships plus some City runs) .  This road is constricted at all the 
intersections where we designed pedestrian crossing movements.   
6. I have asked for staff assistance to analyze the City’s run data for the last couple of years.  Contrary to comments 
made at the last meeting, the majority of our fire/rescue runs are not in the area near the Dexter Ann Arbor 
Road property .  This data will be shared with Council prior to our next facility workshop on April 23rd.  
 I know a couple  members of City Council seem  anxious to make improve ments to  our fire station .  I concur that we need 
to make a few improvements.  However,  moving the station to Dexter Ann Arbor Road is a very poor (and I believe 
costly  as well ) idea .  There is a proposal in this packet to get an updated opinion of cost for the above option, but over 
the next couple of weeks I would ask you to consider the above problems we would be creating if we were to build a 
new station on Dexter Ann Arbor Road.

Page 283EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
HWA Analytics and the Bonner Advisory Group have assembled a team to 
help the city realize its strategic economic development goals. The team has 
assisted the city in the process of building consensus around a strategic vision 
and implementation plan to guide future economic development activities. 
Throughout this process, we have heard from the busi-
ness community and city representatives, compiled 
economic and demographic data, and held interim 
meetings to discuss what we were hearing and ﬁnd -
ing.  As a result of this process, we have compiled a 
series of recommendations that are our responses to the 
feedback from the city, local businesses, and the data.  
Our team was impressed throughout this engagement 
with the high quality of life for residents and businesses 
in the City of Dexter.  We didn’t feel that anything was “broken”, and had to be immediately ﬁxed.  Rather, we 
believe there are aspirational goals the city can pursue 
to add to the already high quality of the city.  Some of 
these recommendations are complex, and may take 
substantial time and effort to accomplish, but all are 
aimed at strengthening the functionality and enjoyment 
of the city. 
The City of Dexter appears to attract young families and 
is home to many highly-educated people with higher than average income levels. This is a result and beneﬁt 
of Dexter being in close proximity to the city of Ann 
Arbor—with its emerging tech industry, and the Univer-sity of Michigan. Continuing to attract such residents 
makes the city an appealing and vibrant place to live, 
work, and play. It also gives Dexter an opportunity to 
grow the types of businesses that would beneﬁt from 
this resident workforce. Many of the city’s residents 
currently travel from Dexter to work elsewhere in the 
county and beyond. The city should strive to create 
and grow employment opportunities for these outgoing 
commuters. It is apparent that the largest and fastest 
growing industries and occupations in the area offer a host of opportunities that the city can build upon. 
These include industry sectors that employ computer 
occupations, business operations specialists, operations 
managers, and manufacturing sales representatives. 
We suggest promoting the city as a rural, small town 
tech hub, with all the advantages of small town life, but 
with access to the types of businesses and employ -
ment that can help the city remain robust and thriving. 
The city should remain open to the growth of diverse 
businesses, but should particularly focus on attracting 
and promoting businesses, such as tech businesses and 
unique lifestyle and artisan brands, which can enhance 
while contemporizing Dexter’s unique rural and small-
town feel. 
In particular, we are recommending the city focus on 
the following initiatives:
Develop a “Dexter Arts and Entertainment 
Tech Council”—home to arts, entertainment, 
and tech
We propose creation of the “Dexter Arts and Entertain-
ment Tech Council” which covers the business corridor 
in Dexter from downtown to Bishop Circle Industrial Park.  
The purpose is to focus on both business growth and 
supporting the special place that Dexter has become. 
We have found through our project research in Dexter 
that business and quality of place co-exist, but these 
need additional structure to help Dexter evolve from 
passively growing to developing around a ﬁrm vision 
of what it wants to become.
DDA: 2018-04-19 
Page 294Education—Strengthen the school/business 
connection through industry and K-12 
collaboration
Our research found a clear interest in connecting the 
school district with industry for partnerships focused 
on training, mentoring, internships, and even curricu-
lum development. More importantly, there is genuine 
interest on behalf of the school district to meaningfully 
engage with industry. A key gap to overcome is ﬁnding 
a liaison between industry and education to formulate 
and shepherd these programs going forward. 
Marketing—Branding and communication
Our process has helped align the perspectives of multi -
ple stakeholders. We have clearly agreed that the City of 
Dexter has many assets to offer to internal and external investors. What appears to be lacking is a uniﬁed and 
consistent marketing message that will develop a brand 
for the city focused on technology, quality of life, down -
town, and the city’s culture. 
Business retention and expansion—
Dedicated economic development manager
The general rule of thumb for any business is that 85% 
of a company’s new business comes from its exist -
ing customer base. This can also be said of business 
investments in a local economy. Business retention 
and expansion is the single biggest factor in a local 
economic development function. Ideally, the economic 
development manager would not have a regulatory 
enforcement role at the city, which conflicts with the 
support of business investments and growth. The eco-
nomic development manager should be in a position 
to help businesses clear through bureaucratic red tape, 
conduct highly collaborative meetings, and act as an 
extra set of hands to the business community in accom -
plishing the goals of the strategic plan.
Grow existing businesses—Target 
destination businesses
There are two destination businesses that should receive 
immediate assistance—Northern United Brewing Com -pany and The Encore Theatre. These businesses add 
character and identity to the city, and as such, should 
receive extra attention; assistance should be provided 
without delay. These businesses can be the driver for 
a new brand identity and are key to making Dexter a 
destination for visitors.
Infrastructure Perception – Myths versus 
Reality 
Work closely with both business and utility service 
providers (including City of Dexter Water Authority) to 
understand both the existing opportunities and short-
comings, that may either enhance or suppress business 
growth.
Enable key city staff to work with 
businesses in a non-regulatory manner
The main purpose of an economic development man-
ager for a local community is to support and enable 
the expansion and relocation of businesses within the 
community. Therefore, it is important for a dedicated 
economic development professional to also be enabled 
to facilitate regulatory flexibility, to bring in partners 
to support expansion projects, and to make ﬁnancial 
commitments (subject to ﬁnal approvals) to move a 
project forward. It is difﬁcult, at best, for this function 
to be undertaken simultaneously by city staff who are 
also charged with upholding regulations and moder -
ating growth.

Page 305INTRODUCTION 
The City of Dexter, in central Washtenaw County, Michigan, has built a thriving downtown 
with Main Street businesses mainly catering to the retail and restaurant trades. The city has a business park with approximately 30 businesses operating there. Further, the city has built recreational amenities (park system, bike trails, canoe/kayak access) to take advantage of the Huron River and Dexter-Huron Metropark. The city wants to leverage these assets and develop a vision and strategy that will provide long-term value to current businesses 
and residents and create well-thought out approaches to economic development efforts. 
HWA Analytics and the Bonner Advisory Group have 
assembled a team to help the city realize its strategic 
economic development goals. The team has assisted 
the city in the process of building consensus around a 
strategic vision and implementation plan to guide future 
economic development activities. A key outcome of the 
process is this strategic planning document that can be 
referred to over the next ﬁve to seven years. This doc-
ument provides a blueprint for Dexter to connect with, 
recruit, and retain target businesses and industries that 
complement the city’s demographics, and quality of life.
Throughout the process of creating community long-
term strategies, we have been guided by seeking 
responses to following broad-based questions, and 
using the responses to help guide the rest of the stra-tegic process:
• What does the community do well?• What does the community want to become?
• How can the community get there?
• 
What are the available tools and assets that will help 
the community reach its goal?
To put the city in an ideal situation to answer these 
questions, the team undertook a multi-faceted process. 
At the beginning, the team initiated an electronic survey 
of key stakeholders and, later in the process, conducted a collaborative, all-day consensus-building session.
Prior to the consensus-building session, the team, led by 
its partner, Economic Modeling Specialists International 
(Emsi) collected demographic data on economic and 
business-related metrics, that has helped inform the 
team and community leaders as to the community’s 
current economic climate and its prospects for future 
growth. The ﬁndings of the survey and demographic 
data were shared with the business community stake-
holders as part of the consensus building process. At 
key stages in the process, the HWA team and business 
community leaders met to discuss ﬁndings and gather 
input on proposed directions. The results of the consen -
sus-building process and the results of the survey and 
benchmark demographic data have been incorporated 
into a list of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) speciﬁc to the city. 
We are conﬁdent this process has led to a well-thought 
out and developed strategic plan.
The survey, consensus building session, business and 
demographic analysis, and strategic planning document 
developed in this project will articulate the community’s 
strengths, provide data to respond to business inquiries, 
and put the community in an excellent position to com -
pete for future development projects.

Page 316ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC 
PROFILE
The City of Dexter has enjoyed strong growth with a relatively younger 
population residing within its city limits. Strong income levels and fewer 
people in poverty coupled with higher educational attainment levels position 
Dexter for strong business and economic growth. The demographics of 
a region affect the size and composition of the labor force and its overall 
economy. 
$88,000The average worker in the city’s labor force earns $88,000. 
274Businesses within the Dexter zip code experienced a net gain of 274 jobs from 6,016 
in 2011 to 6,290 by 2016—an average annual growth rate of 0.9%. Much of the gains 
were in manufacturing, which added nearly 100 jobs during that time.
Dexter’s population is growing at a faster rate than all of Washtenaw County.
500Dexter residents in the labor force remained unchanged over the past ﬁve years, 
while the number of workers in the zipcode region increased by 500 people—an 
annual increase of 1.3%.
67.8%The city has an extraordinarily high labor force participation rate—67.8% compared 
to 63.7% nationwide. 
Computer occupations are considered hot jobs (jobs that are abundant, fast-grow -
ing, and high paying) in the Dexter zip code area as well as manufacturing sales 
representatives, business operations specialists, and operations managers.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW
Strong population growth can strengthen the economic base and create a solid job market for residents. Table 
1 provides a regional overview and a comparison of the City of Dexter to the area encompassing the 48130 zip 
code, and for all of Washtenaw County. Throughout this report, zip code level data (or zip code tabulation area-
ZCT A) was used when government source data were not available. Furthermore, the City of Dexter is known to 
the Census as Dexter village and, therefore, that geography level was used. 
Average earnings for City of Dexter residents in the labor force stands out when compared to the household 
income of the zip code region and county. The average worker in the city’s labor force earns $88,000. The vast 
majority of residents, however, are not earning this income in the city. Approximately 92% of all Dexter city res-
idents commute outside the zip code for work with the largest share of residents commuting to Ann Arbor for 
work, over 32% in 2015. This earning power represents an opportunity for local businesses to capture more of 
residents’ earnings in Dexter restaurants, retail, recreation, and other establishments.

Page 349LABOR FORCE
1 Labor force and unemployment data are not calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics at the City of Dexter or the zip code level, 
therefore, data were derived from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). The labor force is comprised of people age 16 and over 
in the civilian noninstitutionalized population, includ -
ing those classiﬁed as unemployed. Understanding 
labor force composition, particularly in terms of skills 
availability, provides some indications of an economy’s 
dynamism. For example, some economists project lower 
rates of economic growth in coming years driven largely 
by the slowing growth of the labor force. Nationwide, 
slowing labor force growth may be due to several factors, 
including but not limited to the following: 
• Demographic shifts – increases or decreases in retir -
ees or youth 
• Discouraged workers who have dropped out due to 
lack of job prospects 
• People who stay in school longer or return to school 
Labor Force Trends
The City of Dexter had roughly 2,200 residents in the 
labor force in 2015, nearly unchanged from ﬁve years 
prior.1 The Dexter zip code (48130) saw a gain of nearly 
500 residents joining the labor force during this same 
time, an increase of 6.7% (an annual rate of 1.3%). Coun-
ty-wide, the labor force grew at a slower pace—barely 
1% annually (4.1% from 2011 to 2016). 
The recession took its toll on the labor force. In order to 
better understand the labor force since the recession, we 
analyze the labor force participation rate. This broader 
measure is another indicator of labor market supply 
and demand and is deﬁned as the share of population 
(age 16+) that is either working or actively seeking work. 
Across the country, the labor force participation rate has 
been steadily declining for the past 15 years. Some econ -
omists have attributed this to the recession followed by 
the unusually slow recovery that caused some workers to become discouraged and permanently drop out of 
the labor force—particularly the younger working-age cohorts—coupled with the demographic shift of an aging 
workforce, resulting in perhaps a structural shift in the nation’s labor force dynamics. 
This means that if workers who have dropped out of 
the labor force participation do not seek employment 
even if job prospects are strong, then there is no sizable 
influx of workers into the labor market as a recovery 
takes hold—which we are now seeing. Consequently, 
the unemployment rate falls much more quickly. Con-versely, a cyclical change occurs when willing workers, 
previously discouraged by the weak job market, are 
drawn back into the labor market by a robust recovery; they boost the labor force participation rate (since they 
are now actively looking for work) and also impact the 
unemployment rate—which is not what we have seen. 
This trend is occurring nationwide, and it is critical in 
understanding the current workforce and skills needed 
for a region to succeed in helping businesses prosper. 
The ﬁgure below illustrates labor force participation 
trends.
Although the labor force participation rate has declined 
in the City of Dexter, the city has an extraordinarily high 
labor force participation rate—67.8% compared to 63.7% 
nationwide (see Figure 3).

Page 3510Retirement Trends
One issue facing employers is retirement, which is 
the loss of employees, as well as the loss of valuable 
experience and company knowledge. On one hand, the 
growing number of young adults moving to the City of 
Dexter has driven the risk of retirements low. However, 
the people working in Dexter businesses are not neces -
sarily those that reside there, as further explained in the 
commuting trends section later in this report. 
Only data at the county-level is available for workforce 
demographics. Of the largest employing industries in 
Washtenaw County, 19% of their workforce is age 55 and 
older and set to retire over the next 10 years (see Table 2). This is rather low compared to other areas.FIGURE 4:  Labor Force Participation Rates by Age

Top Growing Industries
Zip code level data was used to analyze the Dexter 
labor market. Businesses within the Dexter zip code 
experienced a net gain of 274 jobs from 6,016 in 2011 to 
6,290 by 2016—an average annual growth rate of 0.9%. 
Most of the gains were in manufacturing, which added 
nearly 100 jobs during that time. 
Manufacturing jobs were in bolt, nut, screw, rivet and 
washer manufacturing along with electrical equipment 
and component manufacturing. Area restaurants and 
other food and drinking places along with jobs with 
software publishers were also contributors to the jobs growth. TOP GROWING INDUSTRIES

Page 3813FASTEST GROWING OCCUPATIONS
Industry data is often referred to for a sense of regional 
economic trends, but in order to better understand the 
quality of the jobs in a region, some knowledge of occu -
pations is needed. This is because the earning levels and education requirements of workers bear more of a rela -
tionship to their occupation than to the industry in which 
they work. For example, the manufacturing industry, 
while employing many assemblers and machine opera -
tors – also employs people in management occupations 
and in professional occupations such as engineering. All of these occupations have different pay scales and 
require varying levels of education and training.
Food and retail workers nearly always make up the larg -
est number of occupations in an area. It is no different 
in Dexter (zip code) where they comprise nearly 6% of 
all jobs. Software developers are the third largest occu -
pation, numerically, followed by customer service and 
sales representatives (manufacturing) and ofﬁce clerks. 
Occupations that appear to be highest on the regional pay scale and which also employ a sizeable number of 
workers are software developers, manufacturing sales 
representatives, general and operations managers, FA S T E S T  G R OW I N G

(Table 4). Only four of the top 15 occupations have a 
median wage under $15 per hour.
The fastest growing occupations differ from “hot jobs”— 
(see Table 5) which are those that are most abundant 
in the area, fastest-growing, and highest paying. Emsi 
projects job growth and industry growth for up to 10 
years for industries and occupations using regression models and past trends. 
Metal and plastic workers are the fastest growing occu -
pation but do not hit the mark on highest paying with a median wage of $16.50 per hour. Computer occupations 
are considered hot jobs in the Dexter zip code area as well as manufacturing sales representatives, business 
operations specialists, and operations managers. 
Printing, metal workers, manufacturing sales representa -
tives, scientists and technicians in both life science and 
physical science, computer occupations, and engineers 
are all heavily concentrated in Dexter. This metric of 
regional specialization is measured by looking at the 
share of an area’s employment compared to its share 
of employment at the national level, or location quo -
tient (LQ).

Page 4116COMMUTING PATTERNS
Commuting patterns show how far workers must travel 
from their places of residence to their places of work. 
City-level data is available for commuting patterns. This 
data shows employers or local ofﬁcials whether there is an adequate supply of workers or jobs within a given 
area. According to the Census’ LEHD on the Map pro-
gram, only 8% of residents live and work in the City of 
Dexter. Approximately 92% of all Dexter city residents 
commute outside the zip code for work with the largest 
share of residents commuting to Ann Arbor for work, over 32% in 2015. Of those who commute into the City of 
Dexter for work, 8% live in Ann Arbor and the remainder 
is split between residents from Saline, Chelsea, Livonia, 
Jackson, and Whitmore Lake—largely for manufacturing 
jobs. The data below illustrate the commuting patterns 
for the City of Dexter.
The large portion of residents commuting to Ann Arbor 
are working for University of Michigan, the hospital, or in the software industry. These earnings are spent and 
circulated locally in and around the city.

Page 4217RESIDENT WORKERS
Resident worker analysis examines where workers live 
in comparison to where they work. Net commuters are 
the minimum number of workers who commute in or 
out of the region to satisfy the regional numbers of jobs 
held. A positive number (shown in GREEN in the ﬁgure 
below) describes commuters entering a region, while a 
negative number (shown in RED) describes commuters 
leaving a region. 
Net commuter data (see Table 8) allows economic devel -
opment professionals to understand which occupations 
and skills are leaving the area or vice versa. The top 25 
jobs in the Dexter zip code are losing over 530 residents 
to businesses outside the area. This is a large untapped 
segment of the labor pool that could work in the Dexter 
zip code. The top occupations leaving the area for work elsewhere 
are registered nurses, ofﬁce clerks and secretaries, health 
technologists, and nursing and home health aides. 
Note that Emsi jobs and commuting data do not match 
the Census on the Map data. Emsi uses zip code-level 
data while the Census uses drive-time radii. Emsi also 
uses place of residence data derived from the Census LODES data, speciﬁcally from Origin and Destination 
data, Regional Area Characteristics, and Workforce Area 
Characteristics data which Emsi applies to the occupa -
tion jobs ﬁgures for context. This data is referred to here 
as “Resident Workers.”

Page 4520INDUSTRY CLUSTER ANALYSIS
This section of the report provides descriptions and 
analyses for industry clusters that drive the Dexter econ -
omy. From this analysis, we can determine the busi -
nesses and industry sectors that offer the most potential 
for growth in Dexter.The Region
The larger area of zip code 48130 is the region used 
for this industry cluster analysis. This zip code area 
and Washtenaw County comprise the area from which 
businesses located in Dexter source local goods and 
services, and from which Dexter companies can rea -
sonably expect to draw their workforce. For this reason, 
the analyses that follow will highlight opportunities 
within the zip code (which is slightly larger than the City 
of Dexter), using the greater county region to further 
understand economic development potential. As can 
be seen in Table 9, the Dexter economy is about 3% 
of the county’s economy, but some sectors, such as 
information services, are strong contributors to both 
the Dexter and county economies. The industry clusters 
generating the largest market value of all ﬁnal goods and 
services produced in Dexter are highlighted in Figure 11.
Industry Clusters
Industry clusters are a geographic concentration of 
industries that share common markets, suppliers, tech-
nologies, and workforce needs. Businesses within a 
cluster beneﬁt from their proximity to shared resources 
including a skilled workforce, specialized suppliers, infra -
structure, and a localized base of sophisticated knowl-edge about their industry. Each cluster has a high level 
of economic integration and interdependency. Industry 
cluster analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses 
of different industries within a region and shows where focus needs to be placed to encourage growth.
When analyzing industry clusters, one measure of clus -
ter viability is its ‘location quotient’ (or LQ). The LQ for 
a particular industry measures its share of an area’s 
employment compared to its share of employment at the national level. For example, an LQ of 2.0 indicates 
that an industry accounts for twice the share of employ -
ment in the area than it does nationally, and a LQ of 0.5 
indicates that an industry’s share of employment is only 
half the national average. This comparison reveals the 
industry’s relative concentration in the region. Industries

Page 4722with a high relative concentration – or high LQ – are said 
to be specialized in a region.
More than 40% of the Dexter economy is represented by 
four industry clusters: manufacturing, business services, 
distribution and electronic commerce, and real estate 
and construction. Table 10 shows the speciﬁc industry 
sector that is included in each cluster.
In Dexter, two manufacturing sectors, Bolt, Nut, Screw 
Manufacturing and Plastic Plumbing Fixtures have very high concentrations – 248 LQ and 323 LQ. This means 
that these two sectors are 248 times more concentrated 
and 323 times more concentrated in Dexter than would 
be expected in another economy of similar size.
The above four clusters are dominated by for-proﬁt 
entities. In addition to these clusters, there are another six clusters that are prevalent in the Dexter economy. 
These clusters, however, are comprised primarily of 
either low-paying jobs or not-for-proﬁt/public entities. 
For economic development and strategic planning 
purposes, the government sector, community organi-zations, education, and healthcare establishments are 
not considered here as targets for development. They 
are listed here to provide a fuller characterization of the 
local economy.Therefore, for the analysis that follows, we consider the 
following four clusters:
• Manufacturing
• Business Services
• Distribution and Electronic Commerce• Real Estate, Construction, and Development
Each cluster represents opportunities for diversiﬁca -
tion for Dexter’s economy as well as opportunities for 
regional businesses to diversify their market base. Figure

average growth for these clusters over the next ﬁve 
years is projected to be 3.5%, while general economic 
growth for the city is projected to be 2%. These clusters 
comprise more than 60% of the Dexter economy (as 
measured by GRP). The jobs in these clusters pay, on 
average, a third more than other jobs in the city.The data show that the business services cluster may 
require some attention as projected employment is 
expected to fall over the next ﬁve years. The real estate, 
construction, and development cluster is still emerging 
with much potential for growth. Manufacturing and 
distribution and commerce remain important clusters in the area.
SUPPLY CHAIN ANALYSIS
Supply chain analysis is a process by which the inputs 
and outputs of an area’s industry clusters are evaluated – 
which goods and services are being bought and sold, in 
what quantities, and where they are being bought from or sold to. The analysis can help identify the different 
types of businesses that comprise an industry clus -
ter and, most importantly for economic development, can identify segments of the supply chain that may be 
absent from the region. These supply chain gaps, as they 
are known, can represent opportunities for new develop -
ment that can strengthen existing industry clusters and 
may support other non-related industries in the region.
Table 13, on the next page, shows in-region sales and 
exported (out-of-region) sales for each industry cluster. 
This is useful for understanding how much revenue a 
cluster is bringing into the region through its sales of goods and services outside of the region. Industries that 
predominantly export their products bring new money 
into the economy, which in turn drives other regional 
businesses. Distribution and electronic commerce enter -
prises, for example, sell 84% of their products outside of Dexter, bringing an estimated $330 million in sales 
into the region.
Purchases of services and manufactured goods, respec -
tively, made by Dexter businesses are shown in Table 14 
below. This information helps quantify the supply chain 
needs of businesses within the city. By comparing the 
proportion of supply chain needs met by companies 
within the region to the proportion met by importing 
goods and services from outside the region we can 
identify potential opportunities for new development.

others. Certain clusters, such as machine shops and 
nut and bolt manufacturing, are strong in the region but 
primarily export their products. At the same time, other 
companies are heavily importing about 60% of total 
needs from these same industry clusters. 
Table 14 shows more detailed industry sectors that have 
potential to sell more of their goods and services within the region. Construction products and services are heav -
ily imported by Dexter businesses, yet these sectors are 
also well-represented within the city. Many of the indus -

sell to other businesses – such as management services, 
transportation, wholesale services, and manufacturing 
that supports other manufacturing businesses.

Page 5429DIVERSITY
Diversity in the workforce can be a driving factor in help -
ing businesses appeal to larger markets and customer 
preferences. The variety of backgrounds and experi-
ences that can be found in diverse employee groups 
often brings more creativity into the workplace. Many 
local economies have economic development efforts 
that seek to attract a diverse population base in efforts to 
increase local entrepreneurship and grow local creative 
endeavors, such as in the arts.
The indicators below are for the entire Dexter zip code 
area. However, these provide a good representation of 
the City of Dexter as well. There were 683 millennials 
(ages 20-34) living within the city limits in 2015, nearly 15% of the total population. There is a high proportion 
of young families that live within the Dexter city limits. 
However, diversity is low in the City of Dexter. As shown 
in Table 15, only about 4% of Dexter city residents iden-
tify themselves as ethnic or racial minorities. 
Organizations and communities stand to gain several 
beneﬁts from having a diverse workforce. Many ﬁrms experience growth in market share and are able to pene -
trate new markets or experience greater innovation with 
increasing diversity. Likewise, many communities have achieved greater success in attracting creative, skilled 
talent as their communities grow more diverse.

Page 5530BUSINESS COMMUNITY OUTREACH
Along with collecting demographic and economic data—which paints a 
picture of the Dexter economy—the team planned a multi-pronged business 
community outreach effort consisting of interviews, survey and a consensus 
building session. A description and takeaways of this business community 
outreach process are detailed below. 
ELECTRONIC SURVEY
An electronic survey was sent to approximately 160 
Dexter businesses asking for their views on a variety of 
topics. The goal of the survey was to establish a list of 
topics that were important to the business community 
and to discuss these topics during the group consensus 
building session later in the process. The survey con-
sisted of ﬁve open-ended questions asking the respon -
dents to answer what comes to mind when they think 
of the City of Dexter. These ﬁve questions asked about 
quality of life, business growth, talent, downtown, and 
schools. Seven additional questions asked respondents 
to identify the city’s strengths and weaknesses—as they 
pertain to their businesses, what additional services the 
respondents would like to have provided by the city, and 
a few others. Of the 160 invitations sent to participate 
in the study, 52 responses were received for a response 
rate of 32.5%. It should be noted that 17 responses were 
completely blank, indicating the survey had a high drop -
out rate. The actual full response rate was approximately 
21%. All questions and responses can be found in the 
appendices of this report. INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS
Five individual, conﬁdential one-on-one interviews were 
conducted in the early stages of the strategic planning 
process. The conﬁdentiality ensured these business 
owners spoke openly to the team during the one-hour 
interviews.  This is another technique to ﬁnd out the 
issues, and expectations in a region.  The owners repre -
sented businesses in retail, tech, and agri-business sec -
tors. These interviews helped supplement the responses 
the team received from the electronic survey. Overall, 
these interviews tended to focus on the relationship 
between the city’s staff, Council, and the business com -
munity. Each of the interviewees had their own particular 
issues they wanted to discuss. The interviewees were 
quite forthcoming in describing particular situations and 
the resulting interactions with city staff. 
CONSENSUS BUILDING 
SESSION
The HWA/Bonner AG team convened a consensus 
DDA: 2018-04-19 
Page 5631building session as part of the business community 
outreach portion of the strategic plan development. 
The consensus session attendees were briefed on the 
outcomes of the electronic survey and takeaways from 
individual interviews. Also presented were the results of the demographic and economic proﬁles developed by Emsi for the strategic planning project. The group 
discussed the key takeaways from the research and 
interviews, and participants provided additional feed-
back, along with additional issues. 
SUMMARY OF THE SESSION AND COMMENTS 
As a result of the research conducted for the community 
proﬁle and the business community outreach phase 
of the overall strategic plan development process, we have compiled several ﬁndings that have helped guide 
the recommendations the team will present to the city. 
Feedback from participants in the three phases of the 
business community outreach indicate there are some 
important assets that the city can leverage. Businesses 
told us:

imity to Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan
 ·This provides access to the U-M’s health care 
network
• Dexter has access to major highways to facilitate 
commuters and trade
• Housing opportunities have supported strong pop-
ulation growth in recent years
 ·However, there are also concerns about the limits 
of housing stock—especially affordable housing
• The city has a desirable small-town feel, with high 
quality-of-life, including easy access to nature and 
recreational opportunities
• Generally, the schools are very good
A few issues and concerns have also been identiﬁed 
through the business community outreach process. 
Respondents spoke about infrastructure and a discon-
nect between the city and business. More speciﬁcally 
these issues include:
• There is a perception that infrastructure at times fails 
to meet current demands, which places a question mark on whether future growth could be hindered.
• A lack of young people moving into, or staying in the 
community, could be an issue for long-term business 
growth
• Some concerns have been conveyed about the city’s 
inability to meet demands and requirements of start-
ups and new tech businesses, because of limited 
space, internet, and lack of “user-friendliness” of the 
city government towards business
This last point, citing concerns regarding city-business 
working relations, came up frequently during interviews 
and discussions. A substantial number of comments 
were made regarding the transition the city is making 
as technology permeates most businesses. Some of 
these were best summed up by this comment, “There 
are growing pains with the integration of old and new. 
We have a small town feel with high tech internet needs.” 
Businesses view this transition as not happening effec -
tively. Many expressed the view that there should be 
closer interaction between the business community 
and city staff. For instance, one respondent said, “…we’re 
driving with the parking brake on.” Others said there 
were, “lots of opportunities for positive change.”, “50 
years ago we were a farming area.”, and, “…with respect to business there are some signiﬁcant gaps.” A major 
emphasis should be made to improve relations between 
city government and the business community. Both 
sectors working toward the same goals can be more 
effective than each group operating at cross purposes. 
There are several key external dynamics that have the 
potential to impact the city’s growth and economic 
development efforts—both positively and negatively. 
Being close to Ann Arbor has been a major blessing, 
DDA: 2018-04-19 
Page 5732because university towns are somewhat recession proof. 
Additionally, the presence of the university and its health 
system has provided the county with a dynamic health 
care system and a major employer.
Participants discussed their perceptions of the diversi-
ﬁcation of Michigan’s business portfolio, and observed 
that the region has moved towards a service economy 
featuring lifestyle businesses and craft industries. For 
example, farm-to-table and regional and local trends 
are changing the landscape for agri-business and craft 
industries. Further, technology is creating new industries, 
changing the manufacturing base, and offering a host 
of opportunities. 
Participants in the business community outreach activ -
ities cited the development of neighboring towns and 
townships as an issue, with the Jackson Road corri -
dor in Scio Township offering both retail and housing opportunities. There was also some concern that cur-
rent residents of the city are actively seeking to restrict agri-business. Traditional agri-business such as dairy 
and hog farms may be what these residents hope to 
ban, but this subsequently has restricted craft busi -
nesses that focus on brewing beer, distilling alcohol and 
wineries, along with making it very difﬁcult to establish 
businesses hoping to capitalize on farm-to-table, such 
as Cornman Farms. 
People also cited a few other pressures on the city, such 
as online retail, which can be detrimental to a small retail 
downtown. And population shifts are affecting Michigan 
as it faces negative in-migration and a subsequent aging 
and stagnating population. Millennials, who may be a 
solution to a decreasing and aging population, have 
different priorities in choosing a city. Aligning Dexter’s 
offerings to the needs and desires of young people will 
be key to transitioning to a destination of choice.
The following table is a representation of the strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that the team 
compiled during the strategic planning process

Page 5833STRATEGY: A TECH AND LIFESTYLE HUB WITH 
SMALL TOWN FEEL
Through the process of research, business sector out-
reach, meetings with city staff and elected ofﬁcials, we 
have crafted a strategy that reflects many of the com-
ments, ideas and aspirations of the participants, while 
focusing on changing dynamics and of the workforce, 
business and demographics of the population at large. 
We propose the city begin a campaign to market itself 
as a “tech and lifestyle hub with small town feel”. The city 
can do this while retaining and building on the current 
quality of life, values, and central character of Dexter. 
The values of the marketing campaign can appeal to 
the changing workforce; many high tech workers, as well 
as others, may not want to travel every day, preferring 
instead to tele-commute. This in turn can attract more 
tech businesses, and encourage existing businesses 
to grow in ways that are attractive to a younger work-
force. The city should remain generally open to diverse 
businesses but particularly focus on attracting and pro -
moting tech businesses and unique lifestyle or artisan brands, which enhance while contemporizing Dexter’s 
unique rural and small-town feel.
To bring about this vision, there are factors to address 
in the process. These include:
• 
Address infrastructure issues — perception or reality?
• Address trafﬁc and parking issues
 ·Leverage new tech solutions to manage trafﬁc 
flow
 ·Address bike and foot trafﬁc needs for better 
access to downtown
• Address regulatory barriers--this may require 
increased flexibility as the city targets particular 
business sectors
• Explore incentives to attract target businesses
 · Look at leases and work with real estate profes-sionals to promote targeted businesses
 ·Research which incentives could attract desirable 
businesses
• Benchmarking other communities to comprehen -
sively identify requirements for success, and best 
practices
 ·Commission a market research study to compile 
case studies of similar communities
 · Small cities near major university city
• Develop a marketing and branding plan
 · Create a Dexter brand and story that people can 
relate to 
 · Employ spokesperson personalities that exem-
plify the vision
 ·Integrate this vision into the expanded down -
town plan
Longer-term initiatives include 
• Expand affordable housing
 · Develop rental as well as single family housing 
options
 ·Explore options for accessory spaces or tiny 
homes on existing single family lots
• Build capability to adapt over time
 ·Diverse businesses will have diverse needs so the 
city should be user-friendly and nimble enough 
to respond through a dynamic, flexible process
• Foster school-business connection
 ·Develop culinary programs or “farm to school/
institution” programs
 · Serve fresh food in schools, possibly with a his-
toric tie-in through Gordon Hall
 · Build up the role of natural assets

Page 5934RECOMMENDATIONS
Throughout this process, we have heard from the 
business community and city representatives, 
compiled economic and demographic data, and 
held interim meetings to discuss what we were 
hearing and ﬁnding.  As a result of this process, we 
have compiled a series of recommendations that are 
our responses to the feedback from the city, local 
businesses, and the data.  Our team was impressed 
throughout this engagement with the high quality 
of life for residents and businesses in the City of Dexter.  We didn’t feel that anything was “broken”, 
and had to be immediately ﬁxed.  Rather, we believe 
there are aspirational goals the city can pursue to 
add to the already high quality of the city.  Some 
of these recommendations are complex, and may 
take substantial time and effort to accomplish, but 
all are aimed at strengthening the functionality and 
enjoyment of the city. 
 
Develop a “Dexter Arts and Entertainment 
Tech Council”—home to arts, entertainment and tech
We propose this geographic area to cover the busi -
ness corridor in Dexter from downtown to Bishop Circle 
Industrial Park. The purpose is to focus on both business 
growth and supporting the special place that is Dexter, 
and agglomerating them around the most visible areas. 
We have found through our project research in Dexter 
that business and quality of place co-exist, but these 
need additional structure to help Dexter evolve from 
passively growing to developing around a ﬁrm vision 
of what it wants to become.Education – Strengthen school/business connection through industry and K-12 
collaboration
Our research demonstrated a clear interest in connect-
ing the school district with industry for partnerships on 
training, mentoring, internships, and even curriculum 
development. More importantly, there is genuine interest 
on behalf of the school district to meaningfully engage 
with industry. A key gap to this ultimately is ﬁnding a 
liaison between industry and education to formulate 
and shepherd these programs going forward. 
• Develop “Farm to School” and “Farm to Institution” 
programs
• Promote fresh food in schools—preferably locally 
grown/supplied
• Gordon Hall – grow food for schools (historical tie-in)
• Offer internships in the agribusiness and food man-
ufacturing industries
• Expand the culinary arts programming in school 
system 
• Provide co-share ofﬁce spaces for Career Tech Ed 
and Industry
• Create a Manufacturing Day style event for exposure 
to career pathways
Benchmark other communities
We recommend Dexter benchmark other communi -
ties that are similarly situated as Dexter is—near a city 
that is home to a major university. We have suggested 
four communities that ﬁt this description—Louisville, 
Colorado (University of Colorado, Boulder), Middleton, 
Wisconsin (University of Wisconsin, Madison), Fountain 
DDA: 2018-04-19 
Page 6035Hills, Arizona (Arizona State University), Polk City, Iowa 
(Iowa State University). We have provided economic and 
demographic data on these communities, and compared 
each to Dexter in the Appendix. We suggest looking 
closely at these communities to better understand the 
dynamic between them and their much larger neighbor, 
with the goal being to adapt some of their initiatives and 
best practices to the Dexter city region.
Marketing – branding and communication
Our process has helped align the perspectives of mul-
tiple stakeholders. There is clear agreement that the 
City of Dexter has many assets to offer to internal and 
external investors. What appears to be lacking is a uni-
ﬁed and consistent marketing message that will develop 
a brand for the city focused on technology, quality of 
life, downtown, and the city’s culture. A clear priority 
in this marketing initiative are destination businesses.  Any marketing effort should focus on the Dexter Cider 
Mill, Northern United Brewing Company, The Encore 
Theatre, Downtown Dexter as a whole, and any other unique businesses such as Jenny’s Farmstand.  These 
entities provide a unique opportunity to attract visitors 
all year long.
Business retention and expansion – 
Dedicated economic development manager
The general rule of thumb for any business is that 85% 
of a company’s new business comes from its exist -
ing customer base. This can also be said of business 
investments in a local economy. Business retention and 
expansion is the single biggest factor in a local eco -
nomic development function. The sole purpose, often 
times, of an economic development manager for a local 
community is to support and enable the expansion and 
relocation of businesses within the community. 
Grow existing businesses – Target destination businesses
There are two destination businesses that should receive immediate assistance—Northern United Brewing Com -
pany and The Encore Theatre. These businesses add 
character and identity to the city, and as such, should 
receive extra attention; assistance should be provided 
without delay. These businesses can be the driver for 
a new brand identity and are key to making Dexter a 
destination for visitors.
• New Encore Theatre
 · Assist Encore in ﬁnding a no cost site option as 
a non-proﬁt
 ·Connect Encore with local property owners in 
downtown that might be a development partner
 ·Seek MEDC RRC program dollars to off-set cost 
for Encore
 · USDA Loan Program
 ·Bring together Encore and NUBCO in an arts and 
performance centric real estate development in 
downtown Dexter. 
The park system in Dexter provides a unique opportu-
nity to draw people into downtown for a short leisurely 
respite before hitting the trails again, or perhaps an even 
longer stay to enjoy local businesses.  The City informed 
our team that nearly 300,000 people use the park sys-
tem.  We recommend the City consider deploying the 
following pilot program.  
 ·Recruit local restaurants to provide food trucks or 
food carts in close proximity to the nearest trail 
access point to downtown.  Clear directions to 
the food trucks need to be provided in order for 
pedestrians, runners, joggers, and bikers to take 
a break from the trail for a quick refreshment.  
This type of pilot project can allow the city and businesses to determine if a more concentrated 
and consistent effort could be put into place to 
actively recruit people off the trail system and 
into Dexter’s downtown.

Page 6136Infrastructure Perception – Myths versus 
Reality 
Throughout the strategic planning process, our team 
heard of business challenges with infrastructure in all 
phases of our research.  This includes the survey, indi-
vidual interviews, and the consensus building session.  
Our ﬁndings suggest that there is an overall gap in 
communications between business, government, and 
utilities in regards to existing infrastructure, and needed 
improvements.  This gap in communications has led to 
both misperceptions of what infrastructure is available, 
but also what improvements need to be made.  
Making direct recommendations for infrastructure 
improvements is difﬁcult without more extensive and 
technical investigation by our team. 
Work closely with both business and utility service 
providers (including City of Dexter Water Authority) to understand both the existing opportunities and short-
comings, that may either enhance or suppress business 
growth. 
• We suggest the City of Dexter develop a detailed 
survey instrument for distribution to all businesses.  
Results of the survey should be shared with busi -
nesses and utility providers in an open forum, such 
as a “lunch-and-learn” style format.  In preparation 
for this event, businesses should come ready to dis -
cuss their problems and utility providers should be 
prepared to explain current service levels and future 
plans for expansion and improvement.    The City of Dexter is a perfect mediator for this event to create 
a plan of action for the future.  
• 
Investigate installation of high-speed ﬁber connect -
ing downtown with Industrial park
 ·Connectivity will allow for more “pop up” co-shar -
ing work spaces and aid existing businesses by 
improving their internet accessibility and speed 
of connection
• Address regulatory barriers that have been deemed 
“not business friendly” 
 ·For artisan businesses, especially food, there will be a speciﬁc set of regulatory (and maybe 
infrastructure) barriers to address (water/sewer 
waste treatment and landscaping needs). This 
may require some new flexibility in planning.
• Assist Northern United Brewing in solving water 
issues
 · This may involve upgrading the water treatment 
infrastructure
 ·Pursue USDA loan for water treatment if nec -
essary
 · NUBCO is a magnet business and could be part 
of the Dexter Brand marketing strategy
 ·NUBCO could add more opportunities to down -
town
Parking and Trafﬁc – Technology and 
Planning
Investigate trafﬁc technology that helps with traf¬ﬁc 
congestion and flow and that doesn’t create the need 
for bigger roads.  Offer a collaboration session amongst 
downtown businesses to poll ideas on how to improve 
customer parking for visitors into downtown.
• Investigate trafﬁc technology that helps with trafﬁc 
congestion and flow and that doesn’t create the 
need for bigger roads.
• On several instances our team heard directly from 
businesses, that they are their own worst enemy.  
Oftentimes, business owners and their employees 
park in front of their own business and are taking 
prime parking spaces away from potential shop -
pers.  Communication and proper planning is one 
way to solve these issues.  Out-of-town visitors to 
downtown Dexter critically important to support 
local business growth.  Therefore, the goal should 
be to create a parking situation that affords plenty of 
spaces, allowing easy access to the local businesses.  
Technology development is beginning to enable 
solutions to parking and trafﬁc. The city should 
research if these technologies can help Dexter.
DDA: 2018-04-19 
Page 6237 ·Smart parking applications. This technology 
requires occupancy sensors that communicate 
with a central system, where data would be ana-
lyzed in real time and then sent to a navigation 
device, which then indicates the number of avail -
able spaces and the best route to get there. 
 ·Smart trafﬁc applications.  Collect, store and ana -
lyze data in real time from road sensors, trafﬁc 
lights, GPS on vehicles, Wi-Fi networks and CCTV 
to better understand trafﬁc flows in the city.  By 
combining this data with road closures and main -
tenance schedules, the city staff can design trafﬁc 
models and get real-time insights about trafﬁc 
performance, conditions and incidents to help 
optimize trafﬁc flow.  
• Intentional and safe connections for pedestrians and 
bikers into downtown.
Explore incentives to attract target busines
Work with existing property owners in downtown 
to emphasize the city’s interest in attracting more 
lifestyle companies
 · Explore incentives and favorable regulations to 
attract target businesses
 · Work with real estate professionals to promote 
target businesses
 ·Research what incentives can attract target busi -
nesses
 · Help businesses secure incentives, grants, etc.
Enable key city staff to work with 
businesses in a non-regulatory manner
The main purpose of an economic development man-
ager for a local community is to support and enable 
the expansion and relocation of businesses within the 
community. Therefore, it is important for a dedicated 
economic development professional to be enabled 
to facilitate regulatory flexibility, to bring in partners 
to support expansion projects, and to make ﬁnancial 
commitments (subject to ﬁnal approvals) to move a project ahead. It is difﬁcult, at best, for this function to 
be undertaken simultaneously by city staff who are also 
charged with upholding regulations and moderating 
growth.

Page 6338APPENDIX A: BENCHMARK REGIONS
Dexter, Michigan is located 10 miles northwest of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. To ﬁnd appropriate 
peer regions for Dexter, a wide range of methodologies and parameters used. Parameters include: proximity to 
a university of similar size and prestige to that of the University of Michigan, similar economic and demographic 
characteristics to those of Dexter, and a community emphasis on small business and local economic development. 
Per the requirements, the following four regions were found: 
• Louisville, Colorado.
• Middleton, Wisconsin. • Fountain Hills, Arizona.• Polk City, Iowa.
Each of these regions have been benchmarked against Dexter to approximate similarities which will bring out 
Dexter’s unique characteristics. By benchmarking Dexter to these other regions, a more in-depth mapping for 
future goals and developments can be achieved.

2 All peer region data, including that for Dexter, uses zip code level data, which may include more area and population than the city properLocated nine miles southeast of the University of Col-
orado in Boulder, Louisville is the largest of the Dexter 
peer regions. In 2016, Louisville had a population of 
37,584 people, well over double the population of Dex-
ter (16,557).2 Louisville is growing faster than Boulder. 
From 2016 to 2017 Louisville experienced a popula -
tion increase of .92% compared to Dexter’s growth of 
.34%. Despite Louisville’s current advantages in size and 
growth trends, it does suffer from a much higher cost of living. By using the Cost of Living Index (COLI), it is 
possible to asses exactly how much more expensive it 
is to live in Louisville versus Dexter. Louisville’s COLI is 
113.1, a full 13.1 points higher than the national average. 
Dexter has a COLI of 98.6, 1.4 points below the national 
average. Dexter is the only peer region to have a cheaper 
cost of living than the national average. To get a more in-depth picture for the COLI and what it means for a 
community the average earnings have been compared 
both without and with the COLI applied. Average earn-
ings in Louisville are $78,424 a year and in Dexter they 
are $66,984 a year. This is a difference of almost $12,000. 
However, this is before the COLI is considered. After 
the COLI has been considered, average earnings in 
Louisville decrease to $69,401 a year and in Dexter the 
average wage goes up to $67,660. When adjusting for 
the cost of living, the $12,000 wage gap is narrowed to 
just over$1,500. The low cost of living in Dexter is an 
asset that can be employed to retain and attract talent. 
In 2016, the average wage in the United States was 
$62,100. In Dexter, all but one of the fastest growing 
industries pays well above the national average. How-
ever, in Louisville, only two of the fastest growing indus -
tries pay a wage that is signiﬁcantly different than the 
national average. Professional and Commercial Equip-
ment and Supply Merchant Wholesalers, the highest 
paying industry in ﬁgure 2.1, pays employees an average 
wage of almost $180,000 a year and has grown 98% in the last 5 years. POPULA TION TRENDS

Page 6540The Louisville workforce is over 
three times the size of Dexter. 
The Louisville workforce grew .5% 
whereas the Dexter workforce expe -
rienced a -.07% decline in jobs. As 
with the industry analysis, the work -
force wages in Louisville are quite a 
bit higher in Louisville until adjusted 
for the cost of living. Once the COLI 
has been applied, the wages are almost even. The median hourly 
wage adjusted for COLI is $19.67 in Louisville and $19.03 in Dexter.
The workforce in Louisville is aug-
mented by a steady inflow of com-
muters. In 2017, Louisville had a 
positive net commuting number 
of 1,570. Dexter, on the other hand, 
had a negative net commuting num -
ber of 1,400 residents commuting 
to areas immediately surrounding 
Dexter. The negative commuter number is validation of the high 
level of talent living in Dexter who go elsewhere for work. TA B L E  2 . 1 :  Industry Characteristics

Page 6742MIDDLETON, WISCONSIN
Located four miles west of the University of Wisconsin 
at Madison, Middleton is the second largest peer region 
in terms of population. As of 2016, Madison had 26,409 
people, 24,000 jobs, and a GRP that was almost the 
equivalent of Louisville’s. The export market in Middle-
ton is exceptionally strong. In 2016, Middleton exported 
$3 billion more in goods and services than Dexter. 
Despite the size and strength of Middleton industries, 
the average wage is only$2,000/year more than in Dex -
ter. When adjusted the for cost of living, Middleton’s 
average earnings drop to $64,118 a year, over $3,000 
less than the COLI average earnings in Dexter ($67,660). 
It should be noted, that even after the COLI has been 
applied, Middleton’s COLI adjusted earnings are still well 
above the national average earnings of $62,100 a year. 
In Middleton, Support Activity for Air Transportation 
grew over 1,000% in the last ﬁve years. Unfortunately, 
this is an industry that pays less than $30,000 a year, well 
below the national average of $62,100 a year. The two 
highest paying industries, Software Publishers ($128,539) 
and Management Companies and Enterprises ($123,704), 
grew by 66% and 93% the last two years. 
As with the industry earnings, the wages seen in table 3.2 
undergo a transition when the Cost of Living is applied. 
The largest difference between the regions would be the 
number of jobs and turnover rate. The annual openings in 
Middleton is more than four times the amount in Dexter. 
One of the keys to Middleton’s industry success is the 
large number of in-commuters flooding into the region 
each day for work. In 2017, Middleton had a positive net 
commuter count of 9,747 workers. This has enabled 
Middleton to keep up in terms of production with larger 
regions and push industry and business development throughout the region. POPULA TION TRENDS

Page 7045FOUNTAIN HILLS, ARIZONA 
Located 22 miles northeast of Arizona State University 
in Scottsdale, Fountain Hills has a population of 25,327 
people. This is the third largest of all the peer regions 
and is roughly 9,000 more people than the population 
of Dexter (16,557). Despite a larger population base, the 
Fountain Hills job market (6,673) is smaller than the job 
market in Dexter (6,952). In addition to a smaller job mar -
ket, the Fountain Hills average earnings are $52,131 a year. 
This is more than $14,000 below the average earnings in Dexter, which are $66,984 a year. This is before cost 
of living has been considered. The COLI in Fountain 
Hills is 114.1, the highest of all the peer regions. When 
taking into consideration the COLI for Fountain Hills, 
the average wage drops to $45,729, well over $20,000 
dollars less than the average earnings adjusted for cost 
of living in Dexter, which was $67,660 in 2016.
Of Fountain Hills’ fastest growing industries, only two pay 
yearly earnings above the national average of $62,100. 
Agencies, Brokerages, and Other Insurance Related 
Activities is not only the highest paying of the Fountain 
Hill industries in ﬁgure 4.1 but is also the fastest growing 
of the Fountain Hills industries. Management, Scientiﬁc, 
and Technical Consulting Services, while not growing 
as quickly as Agencies, Brokerages, and Other Insurance 
Related activities, is a high-tech industry with the poten -
tial to continue its rate of growth into the next ﬁve years. 
The workforce in Fountain Hills experienced .62% growth 
from 2016 to 2017. Hourly earnings throughout the work -
force are considerably lower than the hourly wages in 
Dexter, and once the COLI is applied the difference 
becomes more signiﬁcant. When adjusted for cost of living, the median hourly wage in Fountain Hills drops 
from $15.31 an hour to $13.43 an hour while in Dexter, 
median hourly earnings increase from $18.84 an hour 
to 19.03 an hour. POPULA TION TRENDS

Page 7146Commuting patterns in Fountain 
Hills are one of the reasons for its 
low job count and high cost of living. 
In 2017, Fountain Hills had a nega-
tive net commuter number of 2,979 
workers a day, more than double the 
amount of Dexter out-commuters. 
This is an example of having a large 
number of talented workers without 
the quality jobs to keep them in the 
region. Commuters leaving the area 
means a loss of jobs, spending, and 
beneﬁts providing by the businesses 
that might otherwise be located in 
town. As with Dexter, Fountain Hills 
can use this as a marketing tool to 
attract potential business to the 
region. TA B L E  4 . 1 :  Industry Characteristics

Page 7348POLK CITY, IOWA 
Located 20 miles south of Iowa State University, Polk 
City is the smallest of all four peer regions. With a pop-
ulation of 5,722 people in 2016, Polk City has almost 
11,000 less people than Dexter (16,557). From 2016 to 
2017, Polk City increased its population by 1.07%. This is 
the second most growth of any of the peer regions. Out 
of all the peer regions, Polk City has the second lowest 
cost of living (only Dexter is lower). With a COLI of 101.7, 
the average earnings in Polk City change from $58,968 
to $57,812 when applying the COLI. Even before the 
COLI has been considered, the average earnings in Polk 
City are almost $3,000 less than the national average 
($62,100), and roughly $8,000 less than Dexter ($66,984). 
Of the fastest growing industries in Polk City, only two 
pay an average wage above the national average of 
$62,100. Other General Purpose Machinery Manufac -
turing grew by over 50% in the last ﬁve years and pays 
an average wage of $87,000 a year. This manufacturing 
industry is very promising for Polk City. Manufacturing businesses have large supply chains and ripple effects 
in downstream job creation. 
The Polk City workforce grew by .16% from 2016 to 2017. 
In the last year, Polk City had 149 openings, the least of 
any peer region and 643 fewer openings than Dexter 
last year. 
Polk City has a negative net commuter number of 1,644 
commuters a day, 244 more than Dexter. The negative 
net commuter number in Polk City is also larger than 
the number of jobs located in the city. Highly talented 
workers leaving the area does more harm than just miss -
ing out on potential spending and job creation, the 
region misses out on the community development that 
employers can bring to an area. POPULA TION TRENDS

160 invitations were sent. 52 responses were received for a response rate of 32.5%. It should be noted that 17 
responses were completely blank (which do not include project team checks), indicating the survey had a high 
dropout rate. The actual response rate was about 21%.
Cover letter
Dear Stakeholder,
The City of Dexter is undertaking a strategic visioning and planning process.  The city is looking to build con-
sensus around future economic development activities and create a published document that can be referred 
to over the next three to ﬁve years to assist in guiding the organization.  We are commissioning HWA Analytics, 
LLC (HWA) to assist us with this visioning and planning process.  As part of that process, HWA is conducting a targeted survey to help identify initial thoughts from community leaders as to what the city is doing well, and 
what could be improved, in terms of economic development activities.  The insights obtained from this survey 
will help guide the discussion at a consensus building session, to be held later in the strategic planning process.
We are asking for your assistance in starting that discussion by taking a few minutes to ﬁll out this survey. 
In the following section, we list the question that was asked, then there is a compilation of the responses to each 
question.
1) Please tell us in a few words what ﬁrst 
comes to mind when considering the City 
of Dexter in the following Areas:
Quality of Life?: 
• Access to biking and outdoors activities is a plus
• Beautiful venues and love the city country look but 
trafﬁc can be a problem
• Clean
• Downtown is welcoming 
• Great destination
• Great downtown and parks
• Great small town feel and atmosphere. Trafﬁc is 
becoming more of a problem.
• High quality, small town community• 
I enjoy doing business in Dexter. The people are 
friendly and pleasant to work with. I also consider it to be safe. We can walk anytime anywhere without concern.
• On the whole great. Concerned about Mayor/City 
council being developer focused and not resident focused
• 
Property taxes force me to live elsewhere; trafﬁc and 
parking are issues
• Safety, Parking, Ability to walk to businesses• Small town close to bigger city amenities
• Small town feel
• Still a true community that looks out for it’s own.
• The walking path and the ability to walk down town
• Up and coming!
• Vibrant but quiet. We love the proximity to all of the 
amenities we need, but that they are not located 
within the city limits
• Wonderful park, terrible trafﬁc
DDA: 2018-04-19 
Page 7752Business Growth? 
• We appreciate the city management. We need cap -
ital to improve and eventually expand but not nec-essarily from the city.
• A little over the top regarding landscaptin• 
Business growth comes with growth of the pop -
ulation and town, increasing housing with proper 
planning is good for the city and local buisness
• Business growth is good, however there are not many 
incentives for expansion. Dexter does promote that it wants to grow more business and provides some 
good seminars and workshops
• Business has been growing rapidly the last 7 years• Dexter needs more restaurants, especially for busi-
ness lunch
• Lake of parking; more support/marketing in Dexter 
and surrounding areas
• Lots of room to expand
• My business is located here, satisﬁed• Nice Downtown; heavy trafﬁc
• Parking issues
• 
Plenty of opportunities for our business with the 
attraction of people to our area
• Seems great so far
• Slow but picking up
• Stifled by lack of parking
• Struggle with trafﬁc, lack of hotel, not on a bus route
Talent? 
• Access to talent is good with close proximity to the 
University
• All of our employees come from out of town. No 
residents have applied. There is no technical way 
to prepare for work at our company except to have basic math skills and most importantly a good work 
ethic and social maturity. 
• Close to AA• Fantastic region for ﬁnding talent
• Great
• Great access to local and Ann Arbor
• Great access to talent
• Hard to ﬁnd people in the trades skilled area
• Lack of bus route• Need to have better access and ability to ﬁnd tech-
nical people
• No problem attracting talent• 
Schools are very good. My 3 kids attend. Need to 
stop hiring Dexter grads, as schools suffer from nar-row perspective and cliques.
• Skilled talent is laking• 
Talent for manufacturing is average. We typically 
ﬁnd that we have to ﬁnd employees from Ypsilanti, Jackson, and Saline.
• Workforce skill sets are lacking
Downtown?
• Downtown activity is fantastic• Downtown does not need more residents
• Downtown is beautiful and needs to more sustan-
able retail.
• Downtown is great but it needs an Art Center
• 
Downtown should be even more pedestrian friendly 
(such as making central street adjacent to monument 
park pedestrian only) and have increased number of 
restaurants and/or lunch options
• Good core
• Great
• Great access
• High quality for its size
• I love the downtown for its coffee, bakery, ice cream, 
and a few restaurants. Dexter needs a really good 
deli/sandwich shop like the one in Chelsea. If Zing-erman’s expanded here it would be excellent
• Investment in data transmission will pay off in many 
ways.
• Inviting, walkable with exception of park to A&W• Less service providers, more sellers of merchandise
• Love downtown! 
• Quaint - very welcoming
• Quaint, safe, proud to show others
• We are satisﬁed with the mix of businesses down-
town
• 
Would be nice to have more residential choices 
along the river
Schools? (examples – the schools are great, my kids 
go here, schools need a more tech focused Career 
Tech Ed program): • Close to many great schools
• Completely happy with schools
• Difﬁcult to answer since my children do not attend 
the schools in Dexter.
DDA: 2018-04-19 
Page 7853• Don’t have kids in the school but love working with 
them
• Great
• Great schools.
• I hear from people they are good, lacking in skiiled 
trades exposure.education
• My kids just started at Dexter schools they are great
• Schools are good but lack resources for broad offer -
ings
• Schools could not be better• 
Son graduated from DHS. Sorry we did not do IB. 
That is the wave of the future!
• Tech Ed not needed• 
Technical emphasis (engineering, manufacturing) 
would be great
• The one lane railroad bridge limits Dexter’s growth 
and in a few years will make trafﬁc a true turn-off.
• Very well-maintained, good variety of restaurants 
available
• We do not need more technical training. We need 
mature employees who have the discipline to put 
aside personal desires to work together with a team on long term goals; people that are emotionally 
mature, responsible, and base their actions on prin-
ciple and not driven by their feelings and insecurities. 
We will provide the technical training. 
2) Rate each of the following factors in 
terms of how important it is to growing and 
sustaining a business. 
3) Rate how each of these factors are readily 
accessible to you and your business.  
The following table gives the average score for how 
important respondents rated the factor in the blue col-
umn, while the tan column represents the score given 
by how accessible that factor is to the respondent. The 
green column shows the differential between the two 
scores. If the differential is zero, the factor is accessible 
relative to its importance. In other words, that factor is 
being supplied at the level that is demanded. A high 
negative score for the differential (green column) means 
that respondents feel the factor is being undersupplied, 
such as “flow of trafﬁc”.

Page 7954In the following questions, you will use your own words 
to tell us what you think are the City’s strength’s, its weak -
nesses, what’s missing, and what are the most helpful 
factors related to the Growth Factors we outlined above.  
4) What are the city’s strengths in 
supporting your business (or business in 
general)?
• Clean, safe, good internet speed, close to Hwy 94, 
23, M14
• Growing educated community that likes to do busi-
ness with Dexter business
• Historical character and way of life attract business 
who want to be part of that culture.
• I ﬁnd the people in the city administration are helpful 
and good to work with. I appreciate their concern for 
our problems and objectives.
• Proximity to highways. Proximity to UM. 
• They’ve done a great job with park and attracting 
people to the area. City services are prompt - recent 
example being leaf pick up. 
5) What are the city’s weaknesses in 
supporting your business (or business in 
general)?
• Bishop Circle has only one exit and it’s getting con-
gested. Be great to have a south exit away from 
schools.
• City leadership over reach and personal agenda 
focus.
• Data services Electrical services (dirty power, lots of 
outages. this is a MAJOR problem)
• Lack of clear set guidelines for planning and zoning 
commission. This allows debate of opinions but does 
not put forth a united idea of what the city wants to 
look like. 
• Parking and trafﬁc congestion. Trafﬁc is especially 
poor during morning work and school commutes 
and afternoon/evening commutes. 
• Skilled workforce and some infrastructure short -
comings.
• The city is not up to date in technology and ease 
of doing business. The mindset is to stifle the small business owner and listen to the big corporations 
with all the money. Quite a few people in the City Government are way too powerful and elitist. This 
also includes people like       who skirts 
around proper procedures and isn’t honest. People 
like         are honest and working hard 
without his own speciﬁc agenda.
6) What are the beneﬁts of the University 
of Michigan, Eastern Michigan, and 
Washtenaw County Community College 
being located within close proximity to the City of Dexter?
• Access to resources, talent, training
• Access to talent
• Contact movement and activity in the county of 
business, academia, residents, etc.
• Draws people to the area and increases the average 
level of education in the area. 
• Excellent resource and powerful employers.• Great source of talent and innovation
• 
Overflow from these areas make Dexter a great rental 
market (landlord perspective), they are large sta -
ble employers which helps stabilize the area during 
recessionary periods, they create wealth and a posi -
tive economic outlook which helps in terms of local spending.
• 
We draw on the colleges for part time technical 
employees.
7) What opportunities should the City of 
Dexter pursue to support growth of the 
city?
• Develop surrounding area with housing. Asphalt 
many of the dirt roads around the area. Develop 
downtown as a pedestrian area with increased num -
ber of businesses. increase parking. Flow of trafﬁc is 
a big issue. many people who drive through Dexter on a daily commute deliberately stay away at other 
times due to their hatred of trafﬁc issues. 
• Get out of the way so that small business can thrive 
as an example of what character, sense of place, and 
community can do for an area. Focus on supporting 
business groups, chambers, etc.

Page 8055• I believe the success of the city to draw people to our 
area can be seen by our current parking and trafﬁc 
issues. I don’t believe i have the background to advise 
on opportunities to support growth but I can say 
they need to somehow address trafﬁc and parking. 
• PARKING!!!!!!!
• Promote high speed internet, and it’s other great 
advantage mentioned above.
• Strengthen infrastructure (data, electric). Attract more 
diverse restaurant and entertainment choices. Meet -
ings over all 3 meals are important to businesses, and 
they provide exposure and spending in the city. We 
usually go to Chelsea or Ann Arbor for these meet-
ings, because Dexter has very limited business-ap-
propriate options.
• Technology and infrastructure.
8) What services or activities available from 
government or non proﬁts are most helpful 
to supporting your business (or business in 
general)?
• Ease of permits and development planning
• Effort to keep store fronts occupied with quality 
merchants in all areas of the City. Continue to focus 
on improving trafﬁc flow. Protect the character by 
sensibly governing residential development.
• Government should focus on ensuring Dexter con-
tinues to grow in a properly planned way. Including 
adequate housing development and different types 
of housing development. Also ensuring the schools, 
library and parks are funded to the highest standard. 
This makes the Dexter a popular place to move to and ensures growth of business.
• MNJT and STTF.• Recruiting services are very helpful. Dexter has a lot 
to offer, and it would be helpful if someone could 
support our recruiting through tours, welcome 
wagon, etc.
• The city ofﬁces, Fire department and Utilities are 
great to work with.• Trash pick up, yard debris pick up are nice. Other than 
that I can’t think of any services that the city provides 
me that are essential to my business. 
9) What services or activities are missing 
that the city should provide to help your 
business (or business in general)?
• I believe it’s up to the individual business owner to 
make their business successful. I also think its local 
governments job to minimize their interference with 
that success. To date, I believe the city has accom-
plished this.
• It’s a challenge ﬁnding talent. And that won’t be 
going away any time soon. How can we connect 
High Schools students with local business to create 
a program that starts at the Jr. Level of high school 
where those students are given summer jobs that 
can lead to careers at the company after graduation?
• Local bus routes. Trafﬁc congestion assessment • None
• Parking
10) What areas do you think the business 
community can collaborate on to the 
beneﬁt of growing the community and 
companies in the city.
• Businesses can work together to approach data and 
electrical service providers to improve these services.
• Buy local. Businesses should collaborate for group 
purchasing power of products and services that are 
commonly sourced across many companies. 
• Education and work experience opportunities• 
Find a Unique way to connect High School talent 
and the local businesses. I would consider offering 
College T uition grants in exchange for a commit -
ment to work at our company after graduation for 
a short time.
• Promoting the city and celebrating the community
