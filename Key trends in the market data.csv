The Changing Consumer 
and Market Landscape 
This chapter reviews key market and consumer trends  that have been observed, 
primarily focusing on the main problems that consume rs and consumer authorities 
are confronting. The more demanding markets for consu mers have raised related 
challenges for policy makers; those responsible for  consumer protection must 
quickly respond to a rapidly changing and highly so phisticated marketplace. 1. THE CHANGING CONSUMER AND MARKET LANDSCAPE 
CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 16 Introduction 
The markets for, and the marketing of, goods and se rvices have undergone profound 
transformations over the past 20 years. Regulatory r eform, more open global markets, new 
technologies, and the growth of services as an incr easing component of economic activity 
have been agents of change and in many instances ha ve provided significant benefits to 
consumers. However, relatively little attention has  been paid to the challenges these recent 
developments have posed for consumers – often makin g it more difficult for them to 
compare and assess the value of products and servic es. 
Consumers themselves have also changed. Children an d young adults are more 
significant forces in markets, as are the growing n umber of older adults. While better 
educated overall, many consumers today lack the qua ntitative and literacy skills necessary 
to cope with more complex, information-intense marke tplaces. These and other changes 
in socio-economic conditions can have implications for consumer policy. Such trends are 
being followed by consumer authorities both within their countries and through co- 
operation with their colleagues in foreign countrie s, with a view to addressing emerging 
issues in timely and effective ways. 
Changes in markets 
One of the most distinctive changes in markets over  time has been the expansion in 
the choice of goods and services available to consu mers. This growth has been spurred by 
regulatory reform, trade liberalisation, and advanc es in information and communication 
technology. At the same time, there has been a prono unced change in the structure of 
economies, with services accounting for more than 7 0% of GDP in many OECD countries 
in 2006. This is up by more than four percentage poi nts in only ten years in five of the seven 
G7 countries ( i.e. France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U nited States) 
(OECD, 2008a). 
Regulatory reform 
Most OECD countries have liberalised important secto rs over the last two decades, 
thereby promoting more competition. The energy, fin ancial services, telecommunications, 
and transportation industries are cases in point. T he liberalisation has generally been 
beneficial for consumers, promoting greater diversi ty and more choice in products, lower 
prices, and more innovation in the types of goods a nd services offered. 
At the same time, more choice has meant that consum ers have had to learn more 
about markets in order to make good decisions. Util ities are a case in point. Prior to market 
liberalisation, there were few or no choices to be made, so consumers were not required to 
develop knowledge about the market. With deregulati on, additional firms entered the 
market. As the electricity and gas that they were o ffering were identical, the firms sought 
to differentiate their offers by bundling related p roducts or offering various contract terms 
and conditions which were difficult for consumers t o compare. The challenges facing 1. THE CHANGING CONSUMER AND MARKET LANDSCAPE 
CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 17 consumers included complex terminology that could b e confusing, contracts that bound 
consumers for long periods, high exit costs, and/or difficulties in assessing the c osts and 
benefits of choosing fluctuating versus  fixed-price contracts for supply. 
In addition, consumers have had to deal with new fi rms, some of whom have used 
deceptive practices to increase business, thereby p rompting intervention by consumer 
protection authorities. In the telecommunications m arket, for example, companies found 
ways to switch the service providers of consumers w ithout their authorisation (a practice 
known as “slamming”) or falsely described the purpos e and content of documents that 
consumers were asked to sign, and/or found ways to add charges or services that were not 
requested by consumers to their subscription (a prac tice known as “cramming”) (see OECD, 
2008b). In the utilities market, false claims of en ergy savings and reductions in energy costs 
and false environmental claims have been used by so me companies to boost business. 
As a result, consumers who once were accustomed to buying a standard good or 
service provided by a regulated monopoly firm now f unction in a market environment that 
requires careful analysis and assessment of what the y are buying, from whom they are 
buying it, and the length of the contract commitmen t. Greater choice in a deregulated 
market sometimes requires consumers to deal with co mplex information, since they must 
now make decisions that will affect their welfare a nd finances, often in markets in which 
they have limited experience and expertise. Further  complicating the situation is the 
incentive that firms may have to purposely design p roducts that are difficult to compare. 
Evidence suggests that many consumers end up making  sub-optimal decisions in some 
complex markets, completely forgoing potential savi ngs by choosing not to switch to a firm
that would be lower cost or, because of a lack of u nderstanding, choosing to switch to a 
plan that is actually higher cost (Wilson and Wadda ms-Price, 2005). 
As further discussed in Chapters 2 and 4, accurate in formation that consumers can 
easily access and assess is the key to good decisio n making and contributes to a fair and 
efficient marketplace. 
Trade liberalisation 
Despite the recent contraction in world trade, the long-term trend is positive. Over the 
last few decades freer international trade, more ef ficient international transportation 
services and new information and communications tech nology (notably the development 
of the Internet as a global trading platform) have created more open international markets 
for goods and services. Tariffs, for example, have fallen from an average rate of 14.5% 
globally in 1995 to 9.9% in 2007, helping to fuel inc reases in cross-border trade (World Bank, 
2008). World trade in merchandise (as measured by i mport volumes) grew from
USD 5.2 trillion to USD 14.1 trillion during the time p eriod, while trade in services grew 
from USD 1.3 trillion to USD 3.1 trillion (UNCTAD, unda ted). 
Increased trade has promoted competition, thereby b oosting consumer welfare 
worldwide. For example, imports generally benefit co nsumers by providing a wider array of 
products in the marketplace. In most instances, these imported products are purcha sed 
through domestic retailers. Oftentimes, the domesti c retailer provides a guarantee for the 
imported good and the return/exchange policy is tha t of the retailer, regardless of the 
origin of the product. In these circumstances, inte rnational trade does not appear to limit 
a consumer’s ability to seek redress after making a  purchase. On the other hand, 
consumers may face challenges or have some concerns  when purchasing an imported 1. THE CHANGING CONSUMER AND MARKET LANDSCAPE 
CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 18 product, even via a domestic retailer. For example,  a consumer’s willingness to purchase a 
product made in a foreign country may be affected b y a concern about the quality or safety 
of the products and/or the conditions under which t he products were made. There may, for 
example, be questions about weak environmental poli cies in a foreign country, worker 
exploitation and/or inadequate or lax product or la belling standards. Such concerns can be 
triggered by a single or limited number of events. 
With the development of e-commerce, there are also opportunities for consumers to 
benefit by making purchases directly from foreign s ellers. However, consumers’ ability and 
willingness to do so often depends in great measure on the confidence that they have in 
entering into a transaction with a vendor about who m they may know relatively little. The 
situation is further complicated since it may be di fficult to resolve disputes or seek redress 
from a foreign seller when transactions are not con cluded in a satisfactory manner or 
when problems with the good or service surface after  a sale. 
As further discussed in Chapter 4, consumer authorit ies are aware of issues related to 
cross-border trade and have been working together i n various forums in order to address 
problems encountered by consumers. Furtherm ore, the OECD itself has also been very 
active during the last decade in promoting instrume nts that address consumer issues 
related to cross-border trade. 
New technologies 
The development and rapid diffusion of information and communication technology 
(ICT) have significantly affected the array of good s and services that people buy and the 
manner in which they buy these products. Not only h ave the attributes of a typical 
consumer market basket in the OECD countries change d profoundly, but new technologies 
are being brought to market sooner and are being ad opted faster by consumers. For 
example, whereas it took 71 years for the telephone to be adopted in over half of American 
households, it took a bit less than ten years for this penetration to occur with Internet 
access (see Figure 1.1).

THE CHANGING CONSUMER AND MARKET LANDSCAPE 
CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 19 The rapid development of new products has been high ly beneficial to consumers. The 
Internet, for example, has developed into a global trading platform, transforming the way 
consumers learn about and purchase goods and servic es. Some 58% of households in the 
OECD area had home access to the Internet in 2007 (OE CD, 2008c), while about 35% of adult 
individuals in the OECD ordered or purchased goods on the Internet in 2008 (see Figure 1.2). 
Airline and hotel bookings by consumers using the I nternet have grown sharply, while a 
broad range of other items, including cars, food, a ppliances and electronic equipment, are 
also being sold online. Moreover, mobile phones hav e become ubiquitous in today’s society 
and wireless providers are actively working to faci litate the development of new mobile 
commerce services. The new opportunities have given  rise to new challenges, however, as 
Internet fraud has become a substantial problem. In  the United States, 221 226 Internet- 
related fraud complaints were filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission 
in 2007; it is one of the leading complaint areas (U SFTC, 2008). Other key challenges include 
deceptive “upselling” (selling consumers who are purc hasing an item online additional 
products or services without adequately disclosing what the consumer is buying or how 
much it costs), spam (unsolicited commercial electr onic messages), phishing (the process of 
counterfeiting a legitimate website in order obtain  credit-card numbers, banking 
information, passwords and/or other sensitive infor mation), spyware (software that collects 
information about a user without that user’s knowle dge or consent) and malware 
(i.e. malicious software, such as computer viruses, worms  and Trojans). Ferris Research has 
reported that the global cost of spam alone increas ed from USD 50 billion in 2005 to 
USD 100 billion in 2007 (as reported in International Telecommunications Union, 2008). 
Enhancing the benefits that the Internet can bring to consumers will require that 
privacy and security concerns be addressed. A 2007 s tudy by the UK’s Office of Fair Trading 
estimated that 3.4 million people were prepared to us e the Internet, but not willing to shop Figure 1.2. Individuals who ordered or purchased goods or servi ces

savings could amount to between GBP 175 million and G BP 350 million each year 
(UKOFT, 2007a). 
Beyond fraud, the new technologies introduce new te chnical and legal issues. In the 
case of mobile commerce, consumers are using device s with small screens that have 
limited availability to display information. Moreov er, minors now comprise a significant 
component of mobile phone users, which raises issue s when, for example, they enter into 
commercial agreements by misrepresenting their ages or purchase products or services 
that are not intended for minors. Finally, the role  and obligations of service operators, 
mobile commerce vendors and related parties are unc lear. 
Finally, the rapid development of new products has been accompanied by a related 
acceleration in product obsolescence. The developmen t of faster and more sophisticated 
computer hardware, for example, has spurred advance s in new software, and vice versa .
Older computers and operating systems may, as a res ult, not be able to run new programmes, 
rendering them obsolete. In the field of mobile dev ices, the first phone-enabled version of a 
popular handheld e-mail device, for example, requir ed early adopters to use cumbersome 
headphones and wires to make and receive a phone ca ll. Within months, a new series that 
had a built-in speaker and microphone was released (Manes, 2003). Knowing when or even 
whether to buy a product is thus an ongoing challen ge for consumers, as there is no way to 
know at what time an innovative product will be int roduced on the market or when a 
product may become obsolete. Toshiba’s decision to abandon development and manufacture 
of the high-definition DVD (HD DVD) optical storage  format in light of the success of Blu-Ray 
technology is a case in point (full product support  and after sales service was, however, 
maintained for those who owned HD DVD devices) (Tos hiba 2008). 
Growth in services 
Another major change in markets concerns the growin g role of services and the 
impact that ICT has had on the way that many servic es are delivered. Today over half of 
household consumption in many OECD countries is compose d of services, which differ 
from goods in a number of key areas (OECD, 2007). T hey are intangible and often difficult to 
evaluate before a purchase (experience goods), and in some instances even after purchase 
(credence goods). Many require consumers to rely on  the expertise of the service providers. 
Medical treatment, car repair and home maintenance services (electricity and plumbing) 
are examples of such services. Moreover, many servi ce contracts bundle the provision of 
specific service options with goods (for example, c ell phone handsets and service plan 
contracts), thereby blurring the traditional distin ction between goods and services. 
Another key difference between goods and services i s that services cannot be returned 
and when problems occur, redress is often difficult to  obtain. These characteristics can 
make services more vulnerable to fraudulent and mis leading practices, especially in 
markets with low entry and exit barriers, such as h ome renovations. As a result, 
consumers must trust the person or company that the y are buying the service from. Such 
trust can be built on the basis of reputation and/o r the licensing or accreditation of firms. 
Governments can play a role in the latter, while al so potentially helping consumers when 
problems arise, by, for example,  i) providing guidance on selecting a service provider;
ii) establishing legal rights and protections for consu mers; and iii) supporting advisory 
services and/or mechanisms for resolving conflicts.  Consumer policy tools available to 
governments are discussed in Chapter 4. 1. THE CHANGING CONSUMER AND MARKET LANDSCAPE 
CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 21 The nature of some services is being transformed by  ICT. One of the most prominent 
examples concerns the market for financial services . T wenty years ago most people needed 
to visit a bank to deposit or withdraw cash; they w rote paper cheques, received monthly 
bank statements in the post, and were physically in volved in fairly simple, routine, and 
recurring transactions, such as mailing monthly bil l payments. Since then, financial 
services deregulation and technological advances ha ve combined to fundamentally 
transform the relationship between consumers and th eir financial institutions, and how 
individuals conduct their financial operations. For  instance, consumers are increasingly 
banking, paying household bills and purchasing comp lex saving and investment products 
online, as well as conducting financial transaction s using automated teller machines and 
debit cards, and thus rarely need to visit a bank. 
The increased convenience has, however, given rise to a number of important issues 
for consumers. The first concerns additional costs.  For example, a decision by the 
Canadian Competition Tribunal in 1996 opened up the market for automatic banking 
machines (ABMs) to non-financial institution provid ers. Many of these ABMs, commonly 
referred to as “white label” machines, operate in l ower-traffic areas. In order to be 
profitable, they may impose a “convenience fee” on consumers, in addition to regular 
account fees. Most traditional financial institution s have also implemented a “network 
access fee” to non-customers using their networks. While consumers now have more 
available options to withdraw money, they must be c areful as to where they withdraw their 
money as it can cost more than CAD 6.00 to use an ABM  that is not owned by their financial 
institution (Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, u ndated). 
Actions have also been taken in the United Kingdom o n bank charges. In 2006, the 
Office of Fair Trading raised questions about the l evel of charges assessed on credit card 
holders who failed to pay a minimum payment on the due date, exceeded a credit limit or 
failed to honour a payment made. Following the inte rvention, credit card issuers agreed to 
reduce their default charges, with the majority red ucing the charges by almost one half 
(UKOFT, 2006a). In further work an in-depth study of  retail bank pricing investigated the 
fairness of similar charges on cheque accounts (UKO FT, 2007b and UKOFT, 2007c). In 
Hungary, the Competition Authority ( www.gvh.hu ) conducted several investigations in 2006 
and 2007 that examined commercial practices used in marketing credit cards. Fines were 
imposed when it was determined that investigated co mpanies failed to include basic 
material information and conditions that had to be met in order for consumers to qualify 
for credit that advertised as interest-free (GVH, 2 009). 
In Chile, efforts are being made to curb practices whereby department stores impose fees 
on credit transactions which are in excess of contr actual and legally permissible rates 
(SERNAC, 2009). In Belgium, the Federal Ministry of  Economic Affairs recently presented a 
legislative proposal to fight consumer credit abuses.  The proposal includes the following 
measures: i) prohibition of advertisements for credit bundling; ii) limitation on cash advances, 
or “cash credit”; iii) increased fines for infringements of consumer credi t rules; iv) use of a 
standard information form for credit offers; and v) mandatory disclosure in consumer credit 
advertisements that reminds consumers that credit c osts money (FPS Economy, 2009). 
The transparency and complexity of markets for finan cial services are also raising 
challenges. The European Commission carried out a s tudy in 2009 on retail services that 
found widespread problems with the way banks inform  and advise their customers. 
Specific problems included information which in man y cases is difficult to understand, 1. THE CHANGING CONSUMER AND MARKET LANDSCAPE 
CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 22 opaque bank fees and problems with advice. (Van Dij k Management Consultants and 
Centre for European Policy Studies, 2009). In the U nited Kingdom, a recent study revealed 
i) a low level of transparency on fees related to ban k charges ( e.g. insufficient fund charges); 
ii ) complexities in the manner in which these fees are  imposed, resulting in difficulties for 
consumers in predicting when they will be incurred;  and iii ) a significant proportion of 
consumers incurring charges who appear to have unde restimated both their level and 
frequency (UKOFT 2008a, UKOFT, 2008b). In response, g overnments in some jurisdictions 
have determined it is in the public interest to eli minate or reduce certain banking fees and 
have taken actions to do so. In Finland a series of reforms have been made to bett er protect 
consumer interests. Short message service (SMS) len ders, for example, will no longer be 
able to charge loan fees in lieu of interest; the w ay fees were being imposed was deemed 
an unfair contract term (Consumer Agency and Consume r Ombudsman, 2009). Moreover, 
penalty interest ceilings have been introduced on l oan payments that are more than six 
months overdue. 
A similar set of problems arises from the convenien ce of systems used by mobile 
phones, utilities and other industries that automat ically deduct payments from
consumers’ checking accounts or automatically bill th eir credit cards. While increasing 
billing and payment efficiency, the absence of a st ep under which consumers confirm
billing could cause many to be less vigilant. As a r esult, additional charges that could be 
easily avoided could go unnoticed, as could billing  mistakes. 
Another important issue concerns the security of tr ansactions carried out 
electronically. Most traditional banks now offer on line banking services and strongly 
encourage customers to do online banking, assuring their customers that security is high. 
There are, however challenges in this regard. A 2007 survey in Canada found that many 
security requirements are too difficult for regular  users to follow, and that some 
marketing-related messages about safety and securit y are misleading (Mannan and van 
Oorschot, 2007). It is important that the obligatio ns and responsibilities of consumers, 
financial institutions, and vendors be clearly esta blished to avoid confusion and 
misunderstandings when incidents occur. This is of gr owing importance in light of the 
increasing collection, trafficking, and illicit use  of financial information in many OECD 
countries. It is an area where governments have bee n active, through legislative, education, 
and awareness-raising activities. 
ICT advances have also contributed importantly to t he development of new financial 
products that can be tailored to meet individual co nsumer needs and changing 
circumstances. The products are, however, often com plex instruments that require 
consumers to make difficult decisions that weigh sh ort-term benefits and costs against 
long-term considerations. This new reality clearly r aises the issue of whether consumers – 
even those who are financially savvy – have adequate information, tools, and skills to 
assess these new products. The mortgage-related fin ancial crisis that rattled world 
financial markets in 2007-2009 indicates that many ma y not, suggesting that governments 
and other stakeholders need to be more active on th is front. 
Higher education and literacy requirements 
With the proportion of the population obtaining a u niversity education generally 
rising in the OECD area (OECD, 2004, OECD, 2008d), one would expect consumers to be well- 
equipped to deal with today’s more challenging, inf ormation-driven economy. 
Unfortunately, literacy levels are relatively low. Surveys carried out during the 1990s in 1. THE CHANGING CONSUMER AND MARKET LANDSCAPE 
CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 23 many countries revealed that only a small proportio n of respondents had skills needed to 
deal with many standard consumer contracts, such as  car rental agreements and 
insurance contracts (see Figure 1.3, levels 4/5.) A la rger number (level 3) were judged as 
having skills suitable for coping with the demands o f ordinary life and work. But in all 
countries, there was a sizeable population of perso ns who were ill-equipped to cope with 
modern-day challenges (levels 1 and 2). 
One sector of particular concern with respect to li teracy is the market for financial 
services; in this sector, the principle of disclosu re is often the basis of consumer protection. 
Therefore, the ability of consumers to make good cho ices depends on their capacity to read 
and understand detailed information. However, an as sessment on the readability of 
common financial documents in Canada found that near ly all of them were “difficult” or 
“very difficult” to read. Furthermore, the authors found that the primary purpose of 
disclosure documents appeared to be to meet regulat ory requirements, rather than 
providing plain-language information to consumers ( Colbert, Carty and Beam, 1999). Other 
authors are more critical; some suggest that modern  financial service contracts are 
dangerous to consumers in part because disclosure is designed in a manner to confuse 
rather than inform (Warren, 2008). With respect to credit cards, one observer notes that a 
typical contract in the 1980s was a single page long ; as of the early 2000s these contracts 
had grown to more than 30 pages, with much of the ad ditional language adding terms – all 
of which favour the credit-card companies – that ar e difficult to understand (Pacelle, 2004). 
The increasing need for consumer literacy skills, c ombined with the low level of 
financial literacy of some consumers, clearly poses  challenges for policy makers wishing to 
address information shortcomings in markets. As dis cussed in Chapters 2 and 4, mandated 
information disclosure, the provision of technical tools such as online calculators, and the Figure 1.3. Percentage of population aged 16-65 at each quantitat ive literacy level,

CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 24 promotion of plain-language contracts can be helpfu l for consumers, but their value will be 
limited if financial literacy is low. Moreover, whi le education can improve the situation, its 
limitations need to be recognised. Work carried out  by Meza, Irlenbusch and Reynier (2008) 
suggests that attempts to improve financial capabil ity ( i.e. knowledge and skills) may not 
result in improved outcomes as what people choose t o know and what they do with their 
knowledge may primarily depend on their intrinsic p sychological attributes and may, 
therefore, vary considerably despite educational ef forts by governments. 
Changes in consumers 
Just as the market for consumer goods and services h as changed over the last 20 years, 
so have the characteristics that define consumers. Sharper distinctions can be drawn 
between different groups of consumers, and there is  greater diversity among these 
characteristics. The key changes relate to demograp hics, the management of individual 
household finances, and time constraints. 
Consumer demographics 
The age structure in OECD countries has been changi ng, and is expected to further 
evolve over the coming years. As shown in Figure 1.4 , the percentage of consumers aged 
65 and older has increased significantly during the past 40 years, while the share of 
younger persons has declined. This trend is expected  to continue through 2050, with the 
share of senior citizens accelerating to over 25% b y 2050. In absolute terms, the number of 
seniors will climb from about 74 million (in 1960), t o 336 million in 2050. This is capturing 
the attention of consumer authorities. Korea’s Fram ework Act on Consumer protection, for 
example, contains specific provisions calling for p referential measures to protect the 
elderly and other certain other groups deemed vulne rable (Korean Government, 2007). 
Research on ways to assist the elderly in making go od choices, obtaining redress and 
ensuring safety are being carried out by the govern ment (Korea Consumer Agency, 2009). 
One issue concerns the increased vulnerability of s enior adults to certain sales 
techniques, such as door-to-door marketing. In Japa n, problems that senior adults, 
in particular, were experiencing with respect to exc essive purchases of goods and services

consumers to withdraw from contracts arising from door-to- door sales within a year of 
the sale. 
The ability of senior adults to adopt and/or adapt to new technology is also a concern. 
Although many can and do adapt, a sizeable number d o not. While some firms and 
industries have launched initiatives to help out in  this regard (UK Ofcom, undated), this is an 
area that will require ongoing attention as the ina bility or reluctance to identify and use 
goods and services that could be beneficial may hav e significant negative consequences on 
older persons. In addition, the ability to use new technology could help senior adults to 
overcome the challenges many will face as their mob ility decreases (Statistics Canada, 2002). 
The issue surrounding the ability to adopt and use technology is not, however, 
confined only to elderly persons. In Canada, for ex ample, a provincial assessment carried 
out in 1999 on students in grades 5, 8 and 11 revealed  that while students had a good broad 
and global understanding of technology, knowledge a nd skills when using specific 
technologies, such as the Internet or a “tech” prod uct, generally fell far below the levels 
that educators had expected (Saskatchewan Education , 2001). The challenge for policy 
makers in this regard will be to recognise the exte nt to which different societal groups do, 
or do not, keep up with technological advances, and  to explore ways to ensure that those 
who do not benefit from the new technologies are no t left behind. In Germany, the German 
Railway (Deutsche Bahn AG) had planned to encourage  travellers to use self-service 
ticketing machines, by imposing an extra charge for  tickets bought at the personalised 
service desk in train stations. The measure was aba ndoned, however, when it become 
apparent the self-service machines were very diffic ult to access for physically-challenged 
persons (Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and C onsumer Protection, 2009). 
With rising family incomes, young people, whose spe nding is almost wholly 
discretionary, have become increasingly important c onsumers, despite their declining share 
of the population in many OECD countries. While the y may have relatively significant 
discretionary spending capacities, young people may  not have the skills and knowledge 
required to make well-informed and well-reasoned ch oices. Overconfidence, for example, 
often makes young consumers more susceptible to poor  decision making or fraud. A US 
report on the use of credit cards by college studen ts, for example, concludes that many 
students are responsible for making important finan cial decisions for the first time in their 
lives yet are naïve about managing a budget. As a r esult they may be at greater risk of 
incurring substantial debt (including credit-card d ebt) compared to more experienced 
consumers (United States General Accounting Office, 2001). Furthermore, adolescents may 
be vulnerable as they are susceptible to fashions, trends and styles, and may be influenced 
to purchase “hip” or popular items. These factors m ay partially explain the heavy adoption 
of cell phones by youth, with empirical evidence fr om all regions in the world showing that 
adolescents have been the most eager to embrace thi s technology (Geser, 2006). 
Moreover, young adults, defined as those who are un der 30 years old, face a number of 
decisions with major financial consequences that th ey may be making for the first time 
and that could have long-term consequences on their  well-being. These include renting or 
purchasing a home, buying a car, having children, p ursuing costly higher education or 
starting to save for retirement. The fact that thes e young adults are increasingly 
encountering problems related to significant consum er debt further complicates the 
situation, potentially raising challenges for polic y makers (Box 1.1). 1. THE CHANGING CONSUMER AND MARKET LANDSCAPE 
CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 26 Household finances 
By and large, the last several decades have been pr osperous and characterised by 
unprecedented economic expansion. Incomes in many O ECD countries rose, and 
household wealth grew substantially, reflecting app reciating housing assets and rising 
home ownership, in addition to other assets. At the same time, consumer debt rela tive to 
disposable income increased in some countries. As s hown in Figure 1.5, the increases were 
often driven by mortgage and related long-term debt , but other forms of indebtedness also 
rose in most countries. Box 1.1. Loans and savings by youth in Chile, Denmark and Fi nland 
Chile 
The National Consumer Service (SERNAC) and the Nati onal Institute of Youth (INJUV) 
carried out a study in 2007 on the indebtedness of C hilean youth (SERNAC, 2009). The study 
indicates that some 1 237 191 young borrowers (33.2%) b etween 15 and 29 years of age were 
in debt. The highest youth indebtedness levels were  found in department store credit cards 
(28.5% had at least one card and 69% of them had de bts) and in bank credit cards (7.8% had 
at least one card and 57.7% of them had debts). Mos t Chilean indebted youth were between 
25-29 years old (51.4%); some 51% had only finished secondary education, while 29.8% had 
attended college. Most of the debt of young borrowe rs was concentrated in housing, 
education and payment of credits. On average, some 45% of young borrowers’ debt 
(i.e. USD 371) was in default. It should be noted that cre dit is not viewed in a negative way in 
Chile; it is often viewed as a positive indicator o f economic growth. That said, overall level of 
indebtedness, caused in large measure by lack of kn owledge of the credit system, is still 
worrying to consumer authorities. 
Denmark 
In 2008, the Danish Money and Pension Panel conducte d a study of 18-25 year olds’ loans 
and savings (Money and Pension Panel, 2009). Among other things the study shows that 
some 49% of young Danish persons took out a loan in  the two years covered by the study. 
At the same time, some 76% accumulated savings. You ng borrowers reported an average 
debt of DKK 58 000. T ypically, men had more debt than  women. About one in three young 
borrowers (corresponding to 16 per cent of all 18-25 year old Danes) have taken out a less 
favourable loan, with some 86% of young borrowers n ot making inquiries about other loan 
offers before obtaining their loan. Further, some 7 3% of young Danish people did not know 
or had little knowledge of the annual percentage ra te of their loans (APR) and 64% bought 
goods on credit, thinking that these types of loans  have low interest rates. 
Finland 
In 2008, the Finnish National Research Institute of Legal Policy published research on 
payment difficulties associated with SMS loans (Val kama and Muttilainen, 2008). The research 
revealed that 20-24 year olds are the biggest single  group (43%) among SMS loan debtors. 
Research data from District Courts also showed that the average age of individuals facing 
payment difficulties because of SMS loans are 26 yea rs old. Another study on indebtedness by 
Statistics Finland, segmented by age group, showed that the rate of indebtedness was highest 
(189% of income) among households in which the refe rence persons were between the ages of 
25 and 34.

CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 27 As discussed in Chapter 2, consumers can be short-si ghted when it comes to financial 
matters, and overconfident in their ability to manag e debt. Increases in debt levels are 
therefore a concern as the risk of experiencing fin ancial difficulties is higher, as are the 
consequences. The problems that have arisen during the recent financial crisis illustrate 
this point. Given the importance of the issue, most  governments have adopted measures 
to help protect consumers; these include measures r anging from disclosure requirements 
to education and restrictions on certain lending pr actices. 
Finally, while not a consumer protection issue as s uch, the inability of many consumers 
to save for long-term retirement needs, which in ma ny cases may need to cover 30 or more 
years of retirement, poses another challenge for po licy makers. Initiatives to raise awareness 
in this regard, through education, are being pursue d. 
Time constraints 
Another issue consumers routinely confront is findi ng adequate time to properly 
analyse the expanding number of propositions and ch oices that are available. In the 
United Kingdom, for example, the proportion of marri ed or cohabiting couples with 
dependent children where both adults were working ro se from 50% in the 1980s to 62% in 
the 1990s (UK Office for National Statistics, 2000).  By 2008, some 81% of married or 
cohabiting adults (72% of women and 91% of men) wit h dependent children were working 
(UK Office for National Statistics, 2009). In respo nse, time-pressed consumers are likely to 
make key decisions by  i) limiting searches; ii) deferring to an intermediary for advice; 
iii) employing a “rule of thumb” technique to decide ( i.e. a heuristic technique); or 
iv) forgoing making a purchasing decision because of th e effort that would be required to 
properly research and evaluate a proposition. Chapt ers 2 and 3 describe how these 
responses can lead to consumers making decisions tha t can be costly and they may later 
regret. To address these time constraints some cons umers rely on intermediaries (such as Figure 1.5. Household indebtedness in 1988, 1998 and 2008 1
Note: Data for 1988 are not comparable to subsequent years for France, Italy and Japan, due to changes in defi nitions 
or accounting systems. Data for 2008 were not availa ble for Italy and Japan; data for 2007 have been use d instead.

CONSUMER POLICY TOOLKIT © OECD 2010 28 travel consultants, financial advisors and mortgage  brokers). The services provided by 
intermediaries can be highly beneficial both in ter ms of time savings and in terms of 
helping consumers make more informed and better dec isions, provided of course that the 
intermediaries are “honest” brokers who are not inc lined to oversell or recommend overly 
expensive products to generate higher fees and commissions. 
Time considerations are also an important factor wh en consumers experience a 
problem with a good or service. If considerable tim e would be required, they may be 
reluctant to complain or seek redress. Moreover, th e expense, time commitment, and the 
complexity of legal proceedings can make complaint processes impractical for claims 
involving relatively modest transactions. 
Summary 
As indicated above, dynamic changes in the marketpl ace driven by technology 
advances and more open markets and regulatory struc tures have been highly beneficial to 
consumers, providing them with a broader range of i nnovative products from a wider 
selection of firms. The more dynamic markets have, however, created new challenges for 
consumers, and changed the nature of the issues tha t consumer authorities need to 
address. In the consumer protection area, increased  trade and the development of the 
Internet have provided new opportunities for consum ers, but also have increased the need 
for international co-operation to help detect and a ddress consumer problems, particularly 
those with a cross-border dimension, more effective ly. 
In most OECD countries, greater emphasis is being p laced on policies and programmes 
that can help consumers make better decisions, by p romoting market transparency and by 
providing information and guidance on ways to  i) make better decisions;  ii) avoid problems; 
and iii) obtain satisfaction when goods or services do not m eet expectations. Efforts to 
“empower” consumers in these ways are also based on  the increasing recognition by 
governments that confident, informed consumers who make well-reasoned decisions 
represent powerful drivers of innovation, productiv ity and competition. 
In light of the rapid changes in markets and the pr ofound impact they may have on 
consumers, it is particularly important for policy makers to be able to both identify and 
measure sources and instances of consumer detriment  (see Chapter 3). While 
policymakers have a wide array of tools available to  correct market failures when they 
occur (see Chapter 4), it is critical that any polic y decision taken be based on sound and 
objective evidence and careful assessment of the co rrective options available 
(see Chapter 5). Understanding how markets operate an d how consumers make decisions 
is critical in this regard. Chapter 2 provides insigh ts in this area, exploring how the findings 
from work in the field of information economics hel ps to identify when problems are likely 
to exist and cause the greatest detriment and how b ehavioural economics can be useful in 
better understanding consumer behaviour.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSA MORE CONTESTED WORLDvFOREWORD
Welcome to the 7th edition of the National Intelligence Council’s Global Trends 
report. Published every four years since 1997, Global Trends assesses the key 
trends and uncertainties that will shape the strategic environment for the 
United States during the next two decades. 
Global Trends is designed to provide an analytic framework for policymakers early in each 
administration as they craft national security strategy and navigate an uncertain future. The 
goal is not to offer a specific prediction of the world in 2040; instead, our intent is to help 
policymakers and citizens see what may lie beyond the horizon and prepare for an array of 
possible futures. 
Each edition of Global Trends is a unique undertaking, as its authors on the National Intel -
ligence Council develop a methodology and formulate the analysis. This process involved 
numerous steps: examining and evaluating previous editions of Global Trends for lessons 
learned; research and discovery involving widespread consultations, data collection, and 
commissioned research; synthesizing, outlining, and drafting; and soliciting internal and ex -
ternal feedback to revise and sharpen the analysis. 
A central component of the project has been our conversations with the world outside our 
security gates. We benefited greatly from ongoing conversations with esteemed academ -
ics and researchers across a range of disciplines, anchoring our study in the latest theories 
and data. We also broadened our contacts to hear diverse perspectives, ranging from high 
school students in Washington DC, to civil society organizations in Africa, to business lead -
ers in Asia, to foresight practitioners in Europe and Asia, to environmental groups in South 
America. These discussions offered us new ideas and expertise, challenged our assump -
tions, and helped us to identify and understand our biases and blind spots. 
One of the key challenges with a project of this breadth and magnitude is how to organize 
all the analysis into a story that is coherent, integrated, and forward looking. We constructed 
this report around two central organizing principles: identifying and assessing broad forces 
that are shaping the future strategic environment, and then exploring how populations and 
leaders will act on and respond to the forces. 
Based on those organizing principles, we built the analysis in three general sections. First, 
we explore structural forces  in four core areas: demographics, environment, economics, 
and technology. We selected these areas because they are foundational in shaping future FOREWORDImage / BigstockGLOBAL TRENDS 2040vidynamics and relatively universal in scope, and because we can offer projections with a 
reasonable degree of confidence based on available data and evidence. The second sec -
tion examines how these structural forces interact and intersect with other factors to affect 
emerging dynamics at three levels of analysis: individuals and society, states, and the inter -
national system. The analysis in this section involves a higher degree of uncertainty because 
of the variability of human choices that will be made in the future. We focus on identifying 
and describing the key emerging dynamics at each level, including what is driving them 
and how they might evolve over time. Finally, the third section identifies several key uncer -
tainties and uses these to create five future scenarios  for the world in 2040. These scenarios 
are not intended to be predictions but to widen the aperture as to the possibilities, exploring 
various combinations of how the structural forces, emerging dynamics, and key uncertain -
ties could play out. 
When exploring the long-term future, another challenge is choosing which issues to cov -
er and emphasize, and which ones to leave out. We focused on global, long-term trends 
and dynamics that are likely to shape communities, states, and the international system for 
decades and to present them in a broader context. Accordingly, there is less on other near-
term issues and crises.
We offer this analysis with humility, knowing that invariably the future will unfold in ways 
that we have not foreseen. Although Global Trends is necessarily more speculative than 
most intelligence assessments, we rely on the fundamentals of our analytic tradecraft: we 
construct arguments that are grounded in data and appropriately caveated; we show our 
work and explain what we know and do not know; we consider alternative hypotheses and 
how we could be wrong; and we do not advocate policy positions or preferences. Global 
Trends reflects the National Intelligence Council’s perspective on these future trends; it does 
not represent the official, coordinated view of the US Intelligence Community nor US policy.
We are proud to publish this report publicly for audiences around the world to read and 
consider. We hope that it serves as a useful resource and provokes a conversation about our 
collective future. 
Finally, a note of gratitude to colleagues on the National Intelligence Council and the wider 
Intelligence Community who joined in this journey to understand our world, explore the 
future, and draft this report.

     March 2021A MORE CONTESTED WORLD1Key ThemesINTRODUCTION
DURING THE PAST YEAR, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS REMINDED THE WORLD OF 
ITS FRAGILITY AND DEMONSTRATED THE INHERENT RISKS OF HIGH LEVELS OF IN -
TERDEPENDENCE. IN COMING YEARS AND DECADES, THE WORLD WILL FACE MORE 
INTENSE AND CASCADING GLOBAL CHALLENGES RANGING FROM DISEASE TO CLIMATE 
CHANGE TO THE DISRUPTIONS FROM NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND FINANCIAL CRISES.  
These challenges will repeatedly test the resilience and adaptability of communities, states, and 
the international system, often exceeding the capacity of existing systems and models. This 
looming disequilibrium between existing and future challenges and the ability of institutions and 
systems to respond is likely to grow and produce greater contestation at every level. 
In this more contested world, communities are increasingly fractured as people seek security with 
like-minded groups based on established and newly prominent identities; states of all types and 
in all regions are struggling to meet the needs and expectations of more connected, more urban, 
and more empowered populations; and the international system is more competitive—shaped 
in part by challenges from a rising China—and at greater risk of conflict as states and nonstate 
actors exploit new sources of power and erode longstanding norms and institutions that have 
provided some stability in past decades. These dynamics are not fixed in perpetuity, however, 
and we envision a variety of plausible scenarios for the world of 2040—from a democratic renais -
sance to a transformation in global cooperation spurred by shared tragedy—depending on how 
these dynamics interact and human choices along the way. Image / BigstockGLOBAL TRENDS 20402FIVE THEMES APPEAR THROUGHOUT 
THIS REPORT AND UNDERPIN THIS 
OVERALL THESIS. 
GLOBAL CHALLENGES
First, shared global challenges —in-
cluding climate change, disease, financial 
crises, and technology disruptions—are likely 
to manifest more frequently and intensely 
in almost every region and country. These 
challenges—which often lack a direct human 
agent or perpetrator—will produce wide -
spread strains on states and societies as well 
as shocks that could be catastrophic. The 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic marks the most 
significant, singular global disruption since 
World War II, with health, economic, political, 
and security implications that will ripple for 
years to come. The effects of climate change 
and environmental degradation are likely to 
exacerbate food and water insecurity for poor 
countries, increase migration, precipitate new 
health challenges, and contribute to biodi -
versity losses. Novel technologies will appear 
and diffuse faster and faster, disrupting jobs, 
industries, communities, the nature of power, 
and what it means to be human. Continued 
pressure for global migration—as of 2020 
more than 270 million persons were living in 
a country to which they have migrated, 100 
million more than in 2000—will strain both 
origin and destination countries to manage the 
flow and effects. These challenges will intersect 
and cascade, including in ways that are difficult 
to anticipate. National security will require not 
only defending against armies and arsenals but 
also withstanding and adapting to these shared 
global challenges.
FRAGMENTATION
Second, the difficulty of addressing 
these transnational challenges is compounded 
in part by increasing fragmentation  within 
communities, states, and the international system. Paradoxically, as the world has grown 
more connected through communications 
technology, trade, and the movement of 
people, that very connectivity has divided and 
fragmented people and countries. The hyper -
connected information environment, greater 
urbanization, and interdependent economies 
mean that most aspects of daily life, including 
finances, health, and housing, will be more 
connected all the time. The Internet of Things 
encompassed 10 billion devices in 2018 and 
is projected to reach 64 billion by 2025 and 
possibly many trillions by 2040, all monitored 
in real time. In turn, this connectivity will help 
produce new efficiencies, conveniences, and 
advances in living standards. However, it will 
also create and exacerbate tensions at all lev -
els, from societies divided over core values and 
goals to regimes that employ digital repression 
to control populations. As these connections 
deepen and spread, they are likely to grow in -
creasingly fragmented along national, cultural, 
or political preferences. In addition, people are 
likely to gravitate to information silos of people 
who share similar views, reinforcing beliefs 
and understanding of the truth. Meanwhile, 
globalization is likely to endure but transform 
as economic and production networks shift 
and diversify. All together, these forces por -
tend a world that is both inextricably bound 
by connectivity and fragmenting in different 
directions.
DISEQUILIBRIUM
The scale of transnational challenges, 
and the emerging implications of fragmen -
tation, are exceeding the capacity of existing 
systems and structures, highlighting the third 
theme: disequilibrium . There is an increasing 
mismatch at all levels between challenges and 
needs with the systems and organizations to 
deal with them. The international system—in -
cluding the organizations, alliances, rules, and 
norms—is poorly set up to address the com -
pounding global challenges facing populations. 
Images / BigstockA MORE CONTESTED WORLD3The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a stark 
example of the weaknesses in international co -
ordination on health crises and the mismatch 
between existing institutions, funding levels, 
and future health challenges. Within states and 
societies, there is likely to be a persistent and 
growing gap between what people demand 
and what governments and corporations can 
deliver. From Beirut to Bogota to Brussels, 
people are increasingly taking to the streets 
to express their dissatisfaction with govern -
ments’ ability to meet a wide range of needs, 
agendas, and expectations. As a result of these 
disequilibriums, old orders—from institutions 
to norms to types of governance—are strained 
and in some cases, eroding. And actors at ev -
ery level are struggling to agree on new models 
for how to structure civilization. 
CONTESTATION
A key consequence of greater imbal -
ance is greater  contestation  within communi -
ties, states, and the international community. 
This encompasses rising tensions, division, 
and competition in societies, states, and at the 
international level. Many societies are increas -
ingly divided among identity affiliations and at 
risk of greater fracturing. Relationships be -
tween societies and governments will be under 
persistent strain as states struggle to meet 
rising demands from populations. As a result, 
politics within states are likely to grow more 
volatile and contentious, and no region, ide -
ology, or governance system seems immune 
or to have the answers. At the international 
level, the geopolitical environment will be more 
competitive—shaped by China’s challenge to 
the United States and Western-led interna -
tional system. Major powers are jockeying to 
establish and exploit new rules of the road. This contestation is playing out across domains 
from information and the media to trade and 
technological innovations. 
ADAPTATION
Finally, adaptation  will be both an 
imperative and a key source of advantage for 
all actors in this world. Climate change, for ex -
ample, will force almost all states and societies 
to adapt to a warmer planet. Some measures 
are as inexpensive and simple as restoring 
mangrove forests or increasing rainwater stor -
age; others are as complex as building massive 
sea walls and planning for the relocation of 
large populations. Demographic shifts will 
also require widespread adaption. Countries 
with highly aged populations like China, Japan, 
and South Korea, as well as Europe, will face 
constraints on economic growth in the absence 
of adaptive strategies, such as automation and 
increased immigration. Technology will be a 
key avenue for gaining advantages through ad -
aptation. For example, countries that are able 
to harness productivity boosts from artificial 
intelligence (AI) will have expanded economic 
opportunities that could allow governments 
to deliver more services, reduce national debt, 
finance some of the costs of an aging popula -
tion, and help some emerging countries avoid 
the middle-income trap. The benefits from 
technology like AI will be unevenly distributed 
within and between states, and more broadly, 
adaptation is likely to reveal and exacerbate 
inequalities. The most effective states are likely 
to be those that can build societal consensus 
and trust toward collective action on adapta -
tion and harness the relative expertise, capa -
bilities, and relationships of nonstate actors to 
complement state capacity. Images / BigstockGLOBAL TRENDS 20404This edition of Global Trends 
constructs its analysis of the future 
in several stages. 
First, we examine structural forces in 
demographics, environment, economics, 
and technology that shape the contours 
of our future world. 
Second, we analyze how these structural 
forces and other factors—combined 
with human responses—affect emerging 
dynamics in societies, states, and the 
international system. 
Third, we envision five plausible scenarios 
for the distant future in 2040.

poverty reduction will be difficult to 
build on or even sustain. Pressure for 
migration is likely to increase.
Many populations are increasingly pessi -
mistic and distrustful as they struggle to 
deal with disruptive economic, techno -
logical, and demographic trends. Newly 
prominent identities, resurgent established

The world is in the midst of a resurgence 
of open democracies led by the United

other democratic societies are transform -

and improving the quality of life for 
millions around the globe. In contrast, 
years of increasing societal controls and

The international system is 
directionless, chaotic, and 
volatile as international rules 
and institutions are largely 
ignored. OECD countries are 
plagued by slower economic 
growth, widening societal di -
visions, and political paralysis. 
China is taking advantage of 
the West’s troubles to expand 
its international influence. 
Many global challenges 
are unaddressed.The United States and China 
have prioritized economic 
growth and restored a robust 
trading relationship, but this 
economic interdependence 
exists alongside competition 
over political influence, gover -
nance models, technological 
dominance, and strategic 
advantage. The risk of major 
war is low, and international 
cooperation and technolog -
ical innovation make global 
problems manageable.The world is fragmented 
into several economic and 
security blocs of varying size 
and strength, centered on 
the United States, China, the 
EU, Russia, and a few region -
al powers, and focused on 
self-sufficiency, resiliency, and 
defense. Information flows 
within separate cyber-sover -
eign enclaves, supply chains 
are reoriented, and interna -
tional trade is disrupted. Vul -
nerable developing countries 
are caught in the middle.A global coalition, led by the EU 
and China working with NGOs 
and revitalized multilateral 
institutions, is implementing 
far-reaching changes designed to 
address climate change, resource 
depletion, and poverty following 
a global food catastrophe caused 
by climate events and environ -
mental degradation. Richer 
countries shift to help poorer 
ones manage the crisis and then 
transition to low carbon econ -
omies through broad aid pro -
grams and transfers of advanced 
energy technologies. Climate change will increasingly ex -
acerbate risks to human and national 
security and force states to make hard 
choices and tradeoffs. The burdens 
will be unevenly distributed, height -
ening competition, contributing to 
instability, straining military readiness, 
and encouraging political movements.
Governments will face mounting pres -
sures from the combination of economic 
constraints; demographic, environmen -
tal, and other challenges; and more 
empowered populations. A growing gap 
between public demands and what gov -
ernments can deliver will raise tensions, 
increase political volatility, and threaten 
democracy. The mismatch may also 
spur new or shifting sources and models 
of governance. The pace and reach of technolog -
ical developments will increase, 
transforming human experiences 
and capabilities while creating new 
tensions and disruptions for all ac -
tors. Global competition for the core 
elements of technology supremacy 
will increase. Spin off technolo -
gies and applications will enable 
rapid adoption.
Power in the international system 
will evolve to include a broader set of 
sources, but no single state is likely to 
be positioned to dominate across all 
regions or domains. The United States 
and China will have the greatest influ -
ence on global dynamics, forcing starker 
choices on other actors, increasing 
jockeying over global norms, rules, and 
institutions, and heightening the risk of 
interstate conflict. Several global economic trends, 
including rising national debt, a more 
complex and fragmented trading 
environment, the global spread of 
trade in services, new employment 
disruptions, and the continued rise 
of powerful firms, are shaping condi -
tions within and between states. Calls 
for more planning and regulation will 
intensify, particularly of large platform, 
e-commerce corporations.Image / Bigstock | Bagir Bahana / UnsplashGLOBAL TRENDS 20406STRUCTURAL FORCES SETTING  
THE PARAMETERS
Trends in demographics and human develop -
ment, environment, economics, and technology 
are laying the foundation and constructing the 
bounds of our future world. In some areas, 
these trends are becoming more intense, such 
as changes in our climate, the concentration 
of people in urban areas, and the emergence 
of new technologies. Trends in other areas are 
more uncertain—gains in human development 
and economic growth are likely to slow and may 
even reverse in some areas, although a mix of 
factors could change this trajectory. The conver -
gence of these trends will offer opportunities for 
innovation but also will leave some communities 
and states struggling to cope and adapt. Even 
apparent progress, such as new and advanced 
technologies, will be disruptive to many people’s 
lives and livelihoods, leaving them feeling inse -
cure and forcing adaptation. 
The most certain trends during the next 20 
years will be major demographic  shifts as 
global population growth slows and the world 
rapidly ages. Some developed and emerging 
economies, including in Europe and East Asia, 
will grow older faster and face contracting 
populations, weighing on economic growth. In 
contrast, some developing countries in Latin America, South Asia, and the Middle East and 
North Africa benefit from larger working-age 
populations, offering opportunities for a de -
mographic dividend if coupled with improve -
ments in infrastructure and skills. Human 
development, including health, education, 
and household prosperity, has made historic 
improvements in every region during the past 
few decades. Many countries will struggle to 
build on and even sustain these successes. Past 
improvements focused on the basics of health, 
education, and poverty reduction, but the next 
levels of development are more difficult and 
face headwinds from the COVID-19 pandem -
ic, potentially slower global economic growth, 
aging populations, and the effects of conflict 
and climate. These factors will challenge gov -
ernments seeking to provide the education and 
infrastructure needed to improve the produc -
tivity of their growing urban middle classes in a 
21st century economy. As some countries rise to 
these challenges and others fall short, shifting 
global demographic trends almost certainly will 
aggravate disparities in economic opportunity 
within and between countries during the next 
two decades as well as create more pressure for 
and disputes over migration.
In the environment , the physical effects of 
climate change are likely to intensify during the 
next two decades, especially in the 2030s. More Executive SummaryINTRODUCTIONA MORE CONTESTED WORLD7extreme storms, droughts, and floods; melting 
glaciers and ice caps; and rising sea levels will 
accompany rising temperatures. The impact 
will disproportionately fall on the developing 
world and poorer regions and intersect with 
environmental degradation to create new 
vulnerabilities and exacerbate existing risks 
to economic prosperity, food, water, health, 
and energy security. Governments, societies, 
and the private sector are likely to expand 
adaptation and resilience measures to man -
age existing threats, but these measures are 
unlikely to be evenly distributed, leaving some 
populations behind. Debates will grow over 
how and how quickly to reach net zero green -
house gas emissions. 
During the next two decades, several global 
economic trends,  including rising national 
debt, a more complex and fragmented trading 
environment, a shift in trade, and new employ -
ment disruptions are likely to shape conditions 
within and between states. Many governments 
may find they have reduced flexibility as they 
navigate greater debt burdens, diverse trading 
rules, and a broader array of powerful state 
and corporate actors exerting influence. Large 
platform corporations—which provide online 
markets for large numbers of buyers and sell -
er—could drive continued trade globalization 
and help smaller firms grow and gain access 
to international markets. These powerful firms 
are likely to try to exert influence in political 
and social arenas, efforts that may lead gov -
ernments to impose new restrictions. Asian 
economies appear poised to continue decades 
of growth through at least 2030, although po -
tentially slower. They are unlikely to reach the 
per capita gross domestic product (GDP) or 
economic influence of existing advanced econ -
omies, including the United States and Europe. 
Productivity growth remains a key variable; an 
increase in the rate of growth could alleviate many economic, human development, and 
other challenges. 
Technology  will offer the potential to mitigate 
problems, such as climate change and disease, 
and to create new challenges, such as job 
displacement.  Technologies are being invent -
ed, used, spread, and then discarded at ever 
increasing speeds around the world, and new 
centers of innovation are emerging. During 
the next two decades, the pace and reach 
of technological developments are likely to 
increase ever faster, transforming a range of 
human experiences and capabilities while also 
creating new tensions and disruptions within 
and between societies, industries, and states. 
State and nonstate rivals will vie for leadership 
and dominance in science and technology with 
potentially cascading risks and implications for 
economic, military, and societal security.
EMERGING DYNAMICS
These structural forces, along with other 
factors, will intersect and interact at the levels 
of societies, states, and the international 
system, creating opportunities as well as chal -
lenges for communities, institutions, corpo -
rations, and governments. These interactions 
are also likely to produce greater contestation 
at all levels than has been seen since the end 
of the Cold War, reflecting differing ideolo -
gies as well as contrasting views on the most 
effective way to organize society and tackle 
emerging challenges. 
Within societies , there is increasing fragmen -
tation and contestation over economic, cultur -
al, and political issues. Decades of steady gains 
in prosperity and other aspects of human de -
velopment have improved lives in every region 
and raised peoples’ expectations for a better 
future. As these trends plateau and combine 
with rapid social and technological changes, Image / BigstockGLOBAL TRENDS 20408large segments of the global population are 
becoming wary of institutions and govern -
ments that they see as unwilling or unable to 
address their needs. People are gravitating to 
familiar and like-minded groups for communi -
ty and security, including ethnic, religious, and 
cultural identities as well as groupings around 
interests and causes, such as environmental -
ism. The combination of newly prominent and 
diverse identity allegiances and a more siloed 
information environment is exposing and ag -
gravating fault lines within states, undermining 
civic nationalism, and increasing volatility. 
At the state level , the relationships between 
societies and their governments in every 
region are likely to face persistent strains and 
tensions because of a growing mismatch be -
tween what publics need and expect and what 
governments can and will deliver. Populations 
in every region are increasingly equipped with 
the tools, capacity, and incentive to agitate 
for their preferred social and political goals 
and to place more demands on their govern -
ments to find solutions. At the same time that 
populations are increasingly empowered and 
demanding more, governments are coming 
under greater pressure from new challenges 
and more limited resources. This widening 
gap portends more political volatility, erosion 
of democracy, and expanding roles for alter -
native providers of governance. Over time, 
these dynamics might open the door to more 
significant shifts in how people govern. 
In the international system , no single state 
is likely to be positioned to dominate across 
all regions or domains, and a broader range of 
actors will compete to shape the international 
system and achieve narrower goals. Acceler -
ating shifts in military power, demographics, economic growth, environmental conditions, 
and technology, as well as hardening divisions 
over governance models, are likely to further 
ratchet up competition between China and 
a Western coalition led by the United States. 
Rival powers will jockey to shape global norms, 
rules, and institutions, while regional powers 
and nonstate actors may exert more influence 
and lead on issues left unattended by the 
major powers. These highly varied interactions 
are likely to produce a more conflict-prone 
and volatile geopolitical environment, under -
mine global multilateralism, and broaden the 
mismatch between transnational challenges 
and institutional arrangements to tackle them. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR 2040
Human responses to these core drivers and 
emerging dynamics will determine how the 
world evolves during the next two decades. Of 
the many uncertainties about the future, we 
explored three key questions around condi -
tions within specific regions and countries and 
the policy choices of populations and leaders 
that will shape the global environment. From 
these questions, we constructed five scenarios 
for alternative worlds in the year 2040.
• How severe are the looming global 
challenges? 
• How do states and nonstate actors en -
gage in the world, including focus and 
type of engagement?
• Finally, what do states prioritize for 
the future? 
In Renaissance of Democracies , the world is 
in the midst of a resurgence of open democ -
racies led by the United States and its allies. 
Rapid technological advancements fostered A MORE CONTESTED WORLD9by public-private partnerships in the United 
States and other democratic societies are 
transforming the global economy, raising 
incomes, and improving the quality of life for 
millions around the globe. The rising tide of 
economic growth and technological achieve -
ment enables responses to global challenges, 
eases societal divisions, and renews public 
trust in democratic institutions. In contrast, 
years of increasing societal controls and 
monitoring in China and Russia have stifled 
innovation as leading scientists and entrepre -
neurs have sought asylum in the United States 
and Europe.
In A World Adrift , the international system 
is directionless, chaotic, and volatile as in -
ternational rules and institutions are largely 
ignored by major powers like China, regional 
players, and nonstate actors.  Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) countries are plagued by slower eco -
nomic growth, widening societal divisions, and 
political paralysis. China is taking advantage of 
the West’s troubles to expand its international 
influence, especially in Asia, but Beijing lacks 
the will and military might to take on global 
leadership, leaving many global challenges, 
such as climate change and instability in devel -
oping countries, largely unaddressed.
In Competitive Coexistence , the United 
States and China have prioritized economic 
growth and restored a robust trading rela -
tionship, but this economic interdependence 
exists alongside competition over political 
influence, governance models, technological 
dominance, and strategic advantage. The risk 
of major war is low, and international coopera -tion and technological innovation make global 
problems manageable over the near term for 
advanced economies, but longer term climate 
challenges remain.
In Separate Silos,  the world is fragmented 
into several economic and security blocs of 
varying size and strength, centered on the 
United States, China, the European Union 
(EU), Russia, and a couple of regional powers; 
these blocs are focused on self-sufficiency, 
resiliency, and defense. Information flows 
within separate cyber-sovereign enclaves, 
supply chains are reoriented, and internation -
al trade is disrupted. Vulnerable developing 
countries are caught in the middle with some 
on the verge of becoming failed states. Global 
problems, notably climate change, are spottily 
addressed, if at all.
In Tragedy and Mobilization , a global coa -
lition, led by the EU and China working with 
nongovernmental organizations and revital -
ized multilateral institutions, is implementing 
far-reaching changes designed to address cli -
mate change, resource depletion, and poverty 
following a global food catastrophe caused 
by climate events and environmental degra -
dation. Richer countries shift to help poorer 
ones manage the crisis and then transition 
to low carbon economies through broad aid 
programs and transfers of advanced energy 
technologies, recognizing how rapidly these 
global challenges spread across borders. GLOBAL TRENDS 2040 10A MORE CONTESTED WORLD11THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC EMERGED GLOBALLY IN 2020, WREAKING HAVOC ACROSS

and created new uncertainties about the economy, governance, geopolitics, and technology.
To understand and assess the impact of this crisis, we examined and debated a broad range of 
our assumptions and assessments related to key global trends. We asked a series of questions: 
Which existing trends will endure, which trends are accelerating or decelerating because of the 
pandemic, and where are we likely to experience fundamental, systemic shifts? Are the disrup -
tions temporary or could the pandemic unleash new forces to shape the future? Much like the 
terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to produce some changes 
that will be felt for years to come and change the way we live, work, and govern domestically and 
internationally. How great these will be, however, is very much in question. 
ACCELERATING, SHARPENING SOME TRENDS 
The pandemic and corresponding national responses appear to be honing and accelerating 
several trends that were already underway before the outbreak. COVID-19 brought global health 
and healthcare issues into sharp relief, exposed and in some cases widened social fissures, 
underscored vast disparities in healthcare access and infrastructure, and interrupted efforts to 
combat other diseases. The pandemic also highlighted weaknesses in the international coordina -
tion on health crises and the mismatch between existing institutions, funding levels, and future 
health challenges. The COVID-19 Factor: Expanding UncertaintyGiacomo Carra / UnsplashGLOBAL TRENDS 204012Catalyzing Economic Trends.  Lockdowns, 
quarantines, and the closing of international 
borders have catalyzed some pre-existing 
economic trends, including diversification 
in global supply chains, increased national 
debt, and greater government intervention in 
economies. Moving forward, the character of 
globalization may retain some of the changes 
from this crisis period, and debt, particularly 
for developing economies, will strain national 
capacities for many years. 
Reinforcing Nationalism and Polarization.  
Nationalism and polarization have been on 
the rise in many countries, especially exclu -
sionary nationalism. Efforts to contain and 
manage the virus have reinforced nationalist 
trends globally as some states turned inward 
to protect their citizens and sometimes cast 
blame on marginalized groups. The response 
to the pandemic has fueled partisanship and 
polarization in many countries as groups argue 
over the best way to respond and seek scape -
goats to blame for spreading the virus and for 
slow responses. 
Deepening Inequality.  The disproportionate 
economic impact of COVID-19 on low-income 
earners has caused them to fall further behind. 
When COVID-19 is finally controlled, many fam -
ilies are likely to have experienced further set -
backs, especially those working in the service 
or informal sectors or who left the workforce 
to provide dependent care—predominantly 
women. The pandemic has exposed the digital 
divide within and between countries while 
spurring efforts to improve Internet access. 
Straining Governance.  The pandemic is 
straining government capacity for services and 
contributing to already low levels of trust in 
institutions in countries that have not effec -
tively handled the response. The pandemic 
is exacerbating the confusing and polarized 
information environment that is undermining 
public confidence in health authorities, particu -
larly in open societies. Illiberal regimes in some 
countries are using the pandemic as a pretext to more severely crack down on dissent and 
restrict civic freedoms, conditions that may 
outlive the disease. 
Highlighting Failed International Cooper -
ation.  The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the 
weaknesses and political cleavages in interna -
tional institutions, such as the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and United Nations, and 
called into question countries’ ability and will -
ingness to cooperate multilaterally to address 
common challenges beyond infectious disease, 
particularly climate change. The WHO, which 
has faced significant funding difficulties and 
resistance to mandatory surveillance regimes, 
is facing its gravest shock in nearly two de -
cades. The crisis, however, may ultimately lead 
actors to make deeper reforms, standardize 
data collection and sharing, and forge new 
public-private partnerships. 
Elevating the Role of Nonstate Actors.  Non -
state actors, ranging from the Gates Founda -
tion to private companies, have been crucial to 
vaccine research or retrofitting equipment to 
mass produce medical supplies and personal 
protective equipment. Nonstate networks will 
complement national and intergovernmental 
action in future health crises, including early 
warning, treatment, facilitation of data-sharing, 
and vaccine development. 
WHILE OTHERS DECELERATE OR REVERSE
COVID-19 is slowing and possibly reversing 
some longstanding trends in human develop -
ment, especially the reduction of poverty and 
disease and closing gender inequality gaps. 
The longest lasting reversals may be in poverty 
reduction across Africa, Latin America, and 
South Asia, followed by losses in gender equal -
ity. The resources devoted to fighting COVID-19 
and social restrictions could reverse years of 
progress against malaria, measles, polio, and 
other infectious diseases by consuming key 
financial, material, and personnel resources. 
The COVID-19 emergency may bring regions 
together in ways that previous crises have not. A MORE CONTESTED WORLD13Although European countries early in the crisis 
imposed restrictions on border traffic and ex -
ports of critical medical supplies, the European 
Union has rallied around an economic rescue 
package and other emergency measures that 
could bolster the European integration project 
going forward. COVID-19 could also lead to re -
direction of national budgets toward pandemic 
response and economic recovery, diverting 
funds from defense expenditures, foreign aid, 
and infrastructure programs in some coun -
tries, at least in the near term. 
MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS
The unanticipated second- and third-order 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have re -
minded us how uncertain the future is—both 
in the long and short term. As researchers 
and analysts, we must be ever vigilant, asking 
better questions, frequently challenging our 
assumptions, checking our biases, and looking 
for weak signals of change. We need to expect 
the unexpected and apply the lessons of this 
pandemic to our craft in the future.

improving a range of human experiences and capabilities while also creating new tensions 
and disruptions within and between societies, industries, and states. During the next two 
decades, several global economic trends, including rising sovereign debt, new employment 
disruptions, a more complex and fragmented trading environment, and the rise of power -

shape conditions within and 
between states. 
These structural drivers may 
redound in unpredictable

growth, at least through 2030, and are looking to use their economic and population size to

Key Takeaways
Slowing population growth and a rising global median age are presenting poten -
tial economic opportunities for some developing economies, but rapidly aging 
and contracting populations in some developed economies and China will weigh 
on economic growth.
Relatively poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia will account for al -
most all global population growth during the next two decades and will be rapidly 
urbanizing at the same time, most likely overwhelming their capacity to provide 
the infrastructure and education systems necessary to fully harness their econom -
ic growth potential. 
During the next two decades, demographic shifts and economic incentives are 
likely to increase pressure for migration out of developing countries, mostly from 
Sub-Saharan Africa, and primarily into aging, developed countries. Conflict and 
climate disruptions will compound these broader migration trends. 
These demographic and human development trends will put pressure on gov -
ernments to increase public investment and control immigration, potentially fuel 
instability in some countries, contribute to a rising Asia, and add to the agenda of 
already strained international development institutions.STRUCTURAL FORCES

the median age rises, most 
developed and many emerging 
economies will see their 
populations peak and then start 
to shrink by 2040.
SLOWING POPULATION GROWTH,  
AGING POPULATIONS 
During the next 20 years, the world’s popu -
lation will continue to increase every year, 
adding approximately 1.4 billion people to 
reach an estimated 9.2 billion by 2040, but 
the rate of population growth will slow in all 
regions. Population growth in most of Asia will 
decline quickly, and after 2040, the population 
will begin to contract. Although India’s pop -
ulation growth is slowing, it will still overtake 
China as the world’s most populous country 
around 2027. As birthrates remain low and 
the median age rises, most developed and a 
handful of emerging economies will see their 
populations peak and then start to shrink by 
2040, including China, Japan, Russia, and many 
European countries. In contrast, Sub-Saha -
ran Africa will account for around two-thirds 
of global population growth and is poised to 
nearly double its current population by 2050, 
portending extensive strains on infrastructure, 
education, and healthcare.
Aging: An Opportunity and a Burden
The combination of fewer children per woman 
and people living longer will see the global 
population age rise from a median of about 
31 years in 2020 to 35 in 2040. In middle-in -
come countries, falling birthrates and older 
populations can facilitate human development improvements through an increased share of 
working age adults in the population, more 
female participation in the workforce, and 
increased social stability associated with older 
cohorts. However, shifting age structures will 
challenge some governments, including some 
developing countries that are aging before 
reaching higher incomes, such as China and 
Eastern Europe, and poor countries with surg -
ing youth cohorts that will struggle to build 
sufficient infrastructure. 
Older Populations.  Rising old-age dependen -
cy ratios—the population age 65 and older 
relative to the working-age population—can 
weigh on growth even with adaptive strate -
gies, such as automation and increased immi -
gration. In many older countries, including a 
number of advanced economies, the cohort 
over 65 is likely to approach 25 percent of 
the total population by 2040, up from only 15 
percent as recently as 2010. Japan and South 
Korea are likely to reach median ages of more 
than 53 in 2040, up from 48 and 44 respec -
tively. Europe is not far behind with a project -
ed average median age of 47, and Greece, 
Italy, and Spain are likely to age faster. These 
countries are likely to see further productivity 
slowdown in the coming decades because 
older workers usually show fewer productivity 
gains and a greater share of national income 
will be diverted to pensions and health care 
for seniors. 
Working Age Populations.  Countries with 
large working-age cohorts and relatively few 
young and old dependents have the potential 
for higher household savings that can be di -
rected to investment in human development. 
During the next 20 years, South Asia, Latin 
America, and the Middle East and North Africa 
will be in this window of high working-age 
populations relative to below-working-age 
and retired dependents. Sixty-eight percent 
of South Asia’s population will be of working SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA LIKELY TO DOMINATE

percent in 2020. Latin America and the Middle 
East and North Africa probably will also benefit 
from peak working-age population propor -
tions of above 65 percent in the coming 20 
years. These opportunities for higher poten -
tial economic growth will occur only if those 
workers are adequately trained and can find 
jobs. South Asia’s ongoing challenges in job 
creation, technology adoption, and skills train -
ing suggest that it will have difficulties fully 
leveraging its potential labor force. 
Youthful Populations.  During the next two 
decades, most countries with large youth pop -
ulations will be challenged to meet the basic 
needs of their populations, particularly in light 
of the social volatility often associated with 
youth bulges. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the me -
dian age is likely to rise only slightly to 22 by 
2040, still well short of the median age thresh -old of 30 which is often associated with higher 
levels of human development. More than 
one-third of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population 
will be younger than 15 in 2040, compared 
with only 14 percent of the population in East 
Asia. Other populous countries that most likely 
will still be below the median age threshold in 
2040 are Afghanistan, Egypt, and Pakistan. 
URBANIZATION CHANGING DEVELOPMENT NEEDS 
During the next 20 years, the success or failure 
of cities will shape opportunities and quality of 
life for a growing share of the world’s popula -
tion. The urban population share is expected 
to rise from 56 percent in 2020 to nearly two-
thirds by 2040, with nearly all of the growth 
in the developing world. Globally, large cities 
of more than 1 million residents have been 
growing at twice the rate of the overall pop -

population will live in such a large city by 2035, 
up from 20 percent in 2020, according to the 
United Nations’ (UN) projection. Some of the 
world’s least developed countries will have the 
world’s fastest growing urban populations. The 
number of urban residents in poor countries 
is likely to rise by 1 billion to more than 2.5 
billion by 2040, according to UN Population 
Division projections. Sub-Saharan Africa and 
South Asia will contribute nearly half and 
one-third respectively of the increase in poor 
country urbanization.
Urbanization has historically been a key driver 
of economic development, as workers move 
into more productive jobs in cities and urban 
families benefit from better education and 
infrastructure. However, poorer countries 
that are rapidly urbanizing are likely to see a lower payoff from this virtuous cycle of de -
velopment. Many developing country govern -
ments—even working with the private sector 
and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)—
will be challenged to fund the necessary urban 
transportation, public services, and educa -
tion infrastructure. A 2017 World Bank study 
documented how urban areas in Sub-Saharan 
Africa often become stuck in a poverty trap in 
which insufficient worker skills and poor trans -
portation networks have resulted in higher 
costs but lower incomes for workers. In addi -
tion, birth rates in Sub-Saharan Africa’s cities 
are higher than in other developing regions, 
potentially aggravating unemployment over 
time by increasing the labor supply in cities 
more quickly than jobs can be created. 
These low- and lower-middle-income countries 
will also be at greater risk for food insecuri -
ty as they urbanize. They currently produce 
only one-third of the food per capita that 
upper-middle- and high-income countries 
produce, leaving many dependent on imports. 
Food distribution systems in these countries 
are under greater strain and are less resilient 
to shocks such as droughts or floods, and 
urban households lack access to subsistence 
farming opportunities. 
Environmental events are likely to have a 
greater human impact on newly urbanizing re -
gions where dense populations are located on 
coasts and in other vulnerable areas, but pro -
tective infrastructure—most importantly flood 
control and storm-hardy housing—has not 
kept pace. Booming cities of middle-income 
East, Southeast, and South Asia as well as the 
low-income urban areas of eastern and south -
ern Africa are already exposed to the highest 
number of disasters per capita, based on sta -
tistics from the Emergency Events Database. PROGRESS ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

21ASSOCIATED HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 
Many countries will struggle to build on or 
even sustain decades of significant improve -
ments in education, health, and poverty re -
duction. During the past 20 years, at least 1.2 
billion people were lifted out of poverty—that 
is their income surpassed $3.20 a day, which 
is equivalent to the average poverty line in 
low-income countries. In addition, nearly 1.5 
billion reached the middle-class income level 
of at least $10 a day through a virtuous cycle 
of economic growth and human develop -
ment in every region. Basic improvements in 
healthcare, education, and gender equality 
generated rising per capita incomes and, in turn, the fiscal capacity for households and 
governments to fund further improvements, 
especially in less developed countries. 
However, sustained progress in some coun -
tries is likely to be more difficult during the 
coming two decades, particularly given the 
potential for slower and uneven economic 
growth. Many of the next levels of human 
development, including secondary and 
higher education and digital skills training, 
networked and efficient urban infrastructure, 
and improved opportunities for women and 
minority groups, require overcoming social 
impediments, improving political stabili -
ty, and increasing government or private Yannis H / UnsplashGLOBAL TRENDS 204022investment in public services. In much of 
the developing world, initial gains in human 
development focused on moving people out 
of subsistence farming into wage-earning jobs 
and making basic progress on health, educa -
tion, and gender equality. In middle-income 
countries, these easier targets have already 
been achieved—infant mortality, for example, 
is minimal and almost everyone receives pri -
mary education—but complex new challeng -
es, such as pollution and noncommunicable 
disease, are arising. Given the rapid expansion 
of middle-income households during the past 
two decades, governments may struggle to 
meet the needs and expectations of a more 
urbanized, connected, and vastly expanded 
global middle class.
Progress for Women.  The world has seen 
remarkable progress in women’s basic health 
and education in recent decades as well as 
an expansion of legal rights in many coun -
tries. Birthrates in most developing econo -
mies dropped to less than three children per 
woman of child-bearing age by 2020, and 
the age of first birth has risen, increasing the 
opportunities for education and work outside 
the home. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to 
be the greatest outlier on this metric: birth -
rates have decreased in recent years but still 
averaged 4.9 in 2020 and are likely to remain 
high. Maternal mortality has been reduced by 
more than one-third during the past 20 years, 
with South Asia accounting for most of the im -
provement. Most developing economies have 
rapidly reduced the gap in educational attain -
ment for girls, although the average number 
of years of education for girls is still only 81 
percent of the years for boys across Sub-Saha -
ran Africa, a gap between that region and the 
rest of the developing world that is unlikely to 
close during the next two decades. The patriarchal societies of the South Asia 
region and the Arab states exhibit the greatest 
gaps in overall gender equality in the home, 
at the workplace, and for medical care, and 
this shortfall is likely to continue for the next 
20 years. Although women are the primary 
producers of food globally, they have limited 
or no rights to land ownership in many parts 
of the world. Subordination of women to men 
regardless of educational level is enshrined in 
family law in many parts of the Middle East, 
South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. According 
to a 2020 UN review, women held only 25 per -
cent of seats in national legislatures in 2020—
although that is twice the level in 2000—held 
one quarter of corporate managerial posi -
tions, and accounted for less than one-tenth of 
chief executive officers of major companies. 
Improved Childhood Survival and Welfare. 
In many countries the past two decades saw 
rapid advances in reducing malnutrition and 
infant mortality, which is mostly because of 
decreases in preventable communicable dis -
ease; there is little room for further dramatic 
improvements on this front. Progress will be 
especially slow in areas where conflict and cri -
sis are on the rise. In the 1960s, 13 percent of 
infants died in the first year of life throughout 
the developing world; today it averages just 
over 3 percent in the developing world. The 
region with the greatest continuing challeng -
es is Sub-Saharan Africa, where 5 percent of 
infants die within the first year, in large part 
because poverty and communicable disease 
rates remain high. 
Expanding Access to Education.  Educa -
tional attainment is an extremely powerful, 
slow-moving driver of human development, 
with expanding education contributing to 
lifetime expected earnings. Globally, the pro -FUTURE GLOBAL HEALTH CHALLENGES
Advances in basic healthcare during the past few decades, such as wider availability of medicines and vac -
cines and improvements in medical procedures, have reduced disease, improved overall health outcomes, 
and extended longevity for large numbers of people globally. During the next two decades, however, several 
health challenges are likely to persist and expand, in part because of population growth, urbanization, and 
antimicrobial resistance. 
Stalled Progress on Combating Infectious Disease
International progress against tuberculosis and malaria has stalled in recent years. From 2015-19, the num -
ber of cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide increased, and malaria cases declined just 2 percent, 
compared to 27 percent in the preceding 15 years, in part because of the leveling of international investments. 
Looking forward, longstanding, emerging, and re-emerging infectious diseases will continue to endanger 
individuals and communities. The incidence of new pandemics also is likely to grow due to increased risk of new 
animal pathogens infecting humans and factors that enable spread, such as human mobility and population 
density. 
Growing Antimicrobial Resistance
Resistance to antibiotic treatment is rising globally, due in part to overuse and misuse of antibiotics in livestock 
and antimicrobials in human medicine. Drug-resistant infections cause more than half a million deaths annual -
ly, and the cumulative economic cost could reach $100 trillion between 2020 and 2050 because of productivity 
loss and the high cost of extended hospital stays or treatment. 
Rising Levels of Noncommunicable Disease
Noncommunicable diseases now cause the majority of deaths worldwide—principally because of diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma. Health experts project that 
by 2040, noncommunicable diseases could cause 80 percent of deaths in low-income countries, up from 25 
percent in 1990, due in part to longer life expectancies but also to poor nutrition, pollution, and tobacco use. 
In many countries, health systems are not adequately equipped to respond to this shift, which could increase 
human suffering. Periods of economic slowdown exacerbate those risks by straining public health systems and 
putting downward pressure on foreign assistance and private health investments. 
Increasing Strains on Mental Health, Especially Among Youth
Mental health and substance abuse disorders increased 13 percent during the past decade, principally because 
of increases in population and life expectancy but also because of the disproportionate prevalence of mental 
illness among adolescents. Currently, between 10 and 20 percent of children and adolescents globally suffer 
from mental health disorders, and suicide is the third leading cause of death among people between 15 and 
19 years old. 
Health experts project that the economic cost of mental illness worldwide could exceed $16 trillion during the 
next 20 years, with much of the economic burden resulting from lost income and productivity as a result of 
chronic disability and premature death. Preliminary research suggests that because of the pandemic, people in 
every region will experience increased rates of mental distress caused by economic losses and social isolation 
stress disorder. Vera Davidova / Unsplash
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD23
GLOBAL TRENDS 204024portion of adults who have completed primary 
education reached 81 percent in 2020, reflect -
ing a rapid increase across most regions and 
income groups since the 1960s. This level of 
attainment varies across developing countries, 
from up to 92 percent of all adults in develop -
ing countries in Latin America, East Asia and 
Pacific, and Europe down to only 60 percent in 
Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Expanding access to secondary education, 
however, is likely to be harder for developing 
countries because of its relatively higher costs, 
higher dropout rates as some students choose 
work over education, and cultural factors such 
as early marriage that pull women away from 
formal education. Educating a majority of 
the workforce to the secondary school level 
has historically been a driver for countries to 
achieve upper-middle-income status. Cur -
rently, this majority threshold is reached in 
developing countries in Europe and Central 
Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and Latin Amer -
ica, but only a quarter of the Sub-Saharan 
workforce has a secondary school education. 
Moreover, Sub-Saharan Africa is not likely to 
reach the threshold during the coming two 
decades because government, religious, and 
other private sector investment will struggle to 
keep up with population growth. This struggle 
will also dampen economic growth as workers, 
particularly those who choose early entry into 
the workforce over education, will lack the 
skills for higher paying jobs. South Asia is mak -
ing better progress than Sub-Saharan Africa 
on this front and has the potential to reach the 
key development threshold for secondary edu -
cation by around 2040. 
RISING, SHIFTING GLOBAL MIDDLE CLASSES
Globally, the number of households falling 
into a broad definition of the middle class 
has soared in the past two decades, raising expectations for continued improvements. In 
2020, approximately 36 percent of the global 
population was in the middle class with annual 
incomes of $4,000-$40,000, up 13 percent -
age points from 2000, judging from a World 
Bank database of income surveys. The largest 
growth in middle-class populations during 
2000-18 (the latest survey data available) by 
percentage of population occurred in Russia, 
Turkey, Thailand, Brazil, Iran, China, Mexico, 
and Vietnam, in descending order.
During the next two decades, the middle class 
is unlikely to grow at a similar pace, and devel -
oping-country middle-income cohorts could 
well perceive that their progress is slowing. 
Across many countries, the high per capita in -
come growth of the past 20 years is unlikely to 
be repeated, as global productivity growth falls 
and the working-age population boom ends 
in most regions. Global models of household 
income suggest that, under a baseline scenar -
io, the middle class share of the global popula -
tion will largely remain stable during the next 
twenty years, although this outcome will be 
contingent on social and political dynamics.
East Asia, and to a lesser extent South Asia, 
appear better positioned to achieve further in -
creases in per capita income relative to other 
regions, thereby reducing to some extent their 
income, education, and life expectancy gap 
with advanced economies. These regions ben -
efit from effective education systems, general -
ly stable social networks, and competent gov -
ernance. On the other hand, some developing 
countries, including several in Latin America, 
are at high risk of falling into the middle-in -
come trap in which inflation of take-home pay 
outpaces worker productivity, leading to a 
stagnation of economic growth. The problems 
in Latin America’s outlook stem in part from 
poor infrastructure and technology adoption 
and inadequate education systems. A MORE CONTESTED WORLD25

In advanced economies, the middle class is 
contracting with many rising to higher in -
comes and a smaller portion dropping below 
the poverty line. Moreover, the middle class 
in many countries is strained by rising costs 
for housing, healthcare, and education. The 
percent of the population falling below the 
national poverty line in advanced economies has increased in 19 of 32 countries between 
2007 and 2016, including in France, Germany, 
Italy, and Spain, while the majority of those 
that left the middle class across all advanced 
economies rose to higher income levels. This

GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
26Economic Inequality Here to Stay
The factors contributing to the slowing of progress on human development will also contribute to the persistence of 
within-country income inequality. Around half of all countries experienced a widening gap between the rich and the poor 
between 1990 and 2018, including the world’s most powerful states—China, India, Russia, and the United States. Mean -
while, the large countries that experienced declines in inequality during these decades mostly remained above the global 
average for inequality. A number of structural causes combined to contribute to this growing inequality, including technologi -
cal advancements that favored advanced educations and specialized skills while automating low-skill jobs; the outsourcing of 
many jobs and industries to developing economies; and an ideological shift toward market-driven solutions and away from 
redistributive, government policies. A MORE CONTESTED WORLD27at the same time. Most high-skill workers 
probably will continue to benefit from work -
place technology, while middle-skill workers 
doing repetitive tasks that can be automated 
will face declining wages and job losses. Even 
some workers in high paid professions may 
see their earnings challenged by artificial 
intelligence (AI) and machine learning. House -
hold debt has already soared across advanced 
economies in recent years because of these in -
come strains and higher costs for healthcare, 
housing, and education.
MIGRATION: PEOPLE ON THE MOVE 
Demographic trends and economic incentives 
will continue to drive large-scale migration 
during the next two decades. Although there 
is little certainty about the level of migration 
as government policies fluctuate, the push and 
pull factors for cross-border movements of 
people will endure globally—feeding debates 
in destination countries over migration and 
aggravating social divisions in some areas. 
The past 20 years saw a large increase in 
cross-border migration, not only in absolute 
numbers but also as a percent of the global 
population. More than 270 million persons 
in 2020 were living in a country to which 
they had migrated, 100 million more than in 
2000, representing an increase of more than 
half a percent of the global population. Most 
migrants left their homes to pursue better 
economic prospects, but tens of millions were 
fleeing conflict, crime, religious and social 
repression, and natural disasters. 
For the vast majority of migrants who are 
workers, migration flows clearly reflect wage 
differentials between countries—the flows 
are from smaller, middle-income economies 
to larger, high-income economies. Almost 
two-thirds of migrants in 2019 originated from 
middle-income economies, and more than half migrated to high income countries for 
higher pay and to send remittances home. The 
fastest growth in emigration begins at around 
$4,000 per capita GDP, the point at which peo -
ple have reached lower-middle-income and 
can afford to travel, and then begins to slow 
when per capita GDP reaches $10,000-$12,000 
where people are nearing the World Bank’s 
definition of high income, making employment 
opportunities at home more attractive. 
Looking forward, rapid population growth al -
most certainly will add to existing push factors 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, while many other devel -
oping countries are nearing the end of peak 
emigration. The population in the middle-in -
come migration window of $4,000 to $10,000-
$12,000 peaked around 2010 for several 
regions, including Latin America, Central Asia, 
and parts of Eastern Europe. East Asia, South -
east Asia, and South Asia are also nearing or 
past the strongest period for this income push 
factor, but the percent of the population in 
Sub-Saharan Africa in this income window will 
continue to rise during the next 20 years. 
Greater need for workers in aging countries 
is a growing pull factor in European and Asian 
countries. European countries had the largest 
total number of cross-border immigrants at 
the end of 2019 at nearly 70 million, according 
to 2020 UN statistics. One-third came from 
Eastern Europe, which had a working-age 
population that was peaking just as advanced 
European economies were beginning to 
rapidly age. Aging European countries and 
Japan are expanding policies that provide visas 
for workers. 
During the coming 20 years, people fleeing di -
sasters and conflict will continue to contribute 
to migration flows. UN and NGO data show 
that domestic civil and political turmoil have 
pushed 80 million people out of their homes GLOBAL TRENDS 204028as of yearend 2019, of which about a third 
have migrated to other countries. 
BROADER IMPLICATIONS AND DISRUPTIONS
These demographic and human development 
trends will put pressure on governments to 
increase public investment and manage immi -
gration, lead to instability in some countries, in 
some ways contribute to a rising Asia, and add 
to the agenda of already strained international 
development institutions. 
Setbacks for Women, Children, and 
Minorities.  The current pandemic exempli -
fies the fragility of progress against poverty 
in some regions and the potential for regres -
sion for women, minority groups, and others 
lower in economic, political, and social stat -
ure. Although so far mortality in low-income 
countries, outside Latin America, has been 
lower than in the advanced economies, the 
economic impacts have been severe. Beyond 
overwhelmed healthcare systems and the 
negative impact on income for millions of the 
near poor, broader disruptions include lack of 
or limited education and the diversion of med -
ical resources from other priorities, including 
vaccinations and maternal health. 
Growing Pressure For Public Investment.  
Growing populations, especially middle classes 
in developing countries, are putting increased 
pressure on governments for the provision of 
public goods, such as affordable housing, ed -
ucation, healthcare, and infrastructure. Poorly 
governed urban areas, especially those with 
access to infrastructure such as international 
ports or airports, are also ideal habitats for 
organized crime syndicates.
Double-Edged Sword For Political Stability . 
Older populations tend to be less violent and 
ideologically extreme, thus reducing the risk of internal armed conflict. East Asia and Latin 
America will have a median age above 30, sug -
gesting a potential for greater social stability. 
Such populations also have strong preferenc -
es for democracy; where authoritarian re -
gimes remain, instability from so-called color 
revolutions is likely to persist. In addition, 
in countries with fast growing and youthful 
populations, the growing gap between the ex -
pectations of growing urban cohorts and their 
governments’ ability to provide for their edu -
cation, healthcare, and job opportunities has 
the potential to increase political instability. In 
such countries, recruitment to radical extrem -
ist movements will be a major risk as well.
Increased Debate Over Migration.  Immi -
grants can help developed economies miti -
gate the downsides of an aging population by 
improving economic productivity, providing 
services, and expanding the tax base. How -
ever, countervailing pressures such as strong 
cultural preferences for maintaining national 
identity and ethnic homogeneity could con -
tinue to fuel an antimigrant backlash in many 
developed countries and increasingly in some 
developing and middle-income countries 
with declining workforces, such as China. As a 
result, many are likely to choose technological 
innovation and automation and limit migration 
to highly skilled labor. Within and between 
countries, debates and division will continue 
over how much migration to allow and how to 
control flows. 
Some Shifts Could Benefit A Rising East.  
Many developing countries in Asia will either 
gain potential advantages from demographic 
trends or are relatively well positioned to over -
come demographic headwinds. As a result per 
capita incomes and human development lev -
els probably will rise more in Asia than in any 
other region. Most Asian countries will con -Photo / Shutterstock
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD29tinue to have large working-age populations, 
high secondary-level graduation rates, and, for 
many, substantial investments in health and 
infrastructure that bolster levels of well-be -
ing. The greatest variable is likely to be how 
China handles the demographic crunch it will 
see during the next two decades—the deep 
decline in fertility from its one-child policy has 
already halted the growth of its labor force 
and will saddle it with a doubling of its pop -
ulation over 65 during the next two decades 
to nearly 350 million, the largest by far of any 
country. Even if the Chinese workforce is able 
to rise closer to advanced-economy produc -
tivity levels through improved training and 
automation, China remains in danger of hitting 
a middle-income trap by the 2030s, which may 
challenge domestic stability. 
Strained International Development 
Institutions . International institutions fo -
cused on human development will face a more 
complicated operating environment as de -
mands for their coordination efforts grow. Any 
increase in humanitarian and refugee crises 
stemming from natural and human-created causes will divert international resources from 
efforts to make systemic improvements in 
poverty and disease. The likely failure of many 
countries to meet the UN’s 2030 Sustainable 
Development Goals will have the largest 
impact on middle-income societies where 
populations that have recently emerged out 
of poverty are demanding progress toward 
next levels of education, medical care, and 
environmental quality. Traditional providers of 
development assistance might not be able to 
keep up with needs. Shortfalls in multilateral 
development assistance could facilitate plans 
by China and other countries to gain advan -
tage from financing critical urban infrastruc -
ture in developing countries.ENVIRONMENTSTRUCTURAL FORCES
Photo / Pexels30Key Takeaways
During the next 20 years, the physical effects from climate change of higher tem -
peratures, sea level rise, and extreme weather events will impact every country. 
The costs and challenges will disproportionately fall on the developing world, in -
tersecting with environmental degradation to intensify risks to food, water, health, 
and energy security. 
There will be increased emphasis on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions to 
achieve net zero with new energy technologies and carbon dioxide removal 
techniques to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees 
Celsius. However, as the world gets closer to exceeding 1.5°C—probably within the 
next 20 years—calls will increase for geoengineering research and possible deploy -
ment to cool the planet, despite possibly dire consequences. 
Debate will increase over how and how fast the world should reach net zero as 
countries face hard choices over how to implement drastic emissions cuts and 
adaptive measures. Neither the burdens nor the benefits will be evenly distributed 
within or between countries, heightening competition, contributing to instability, 
straining military readiness, and encouraging political discord.Photo / Pexels

31CLIMATE CHANGE HERE AND INTENSIFYING
We are living in a world already affected by 
climate change caused by growing human-in -
duced concentrations of greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere. The world has warmed on 
average 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th 
century, causing diminished glaciers and ice 
caps, higher sea levels, more intense storms 
and heat waves, and a more acidic ocean, 
according to the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change. The past 10 years were the 
hottest on record, and every decade since 
the 1960s has been hotter than the previ -
ous one. On the current path, it is probable 
that within the next 20 years global warming 
will surpass 1.5°C while heading toward 2°C 
possibly by mid-century. Cumulative emis -
sions already in the atmosphere will drive 
temperature increases in the next two de -
cades even if emissions were to reach net zero 
immediately, according to the US National 
Climate Assessment.
Physical Effects
The physical effects of a changing climate are 
likely to gradually intensify during the next two 
decades compared to the catastrophic impacts 
modeled for the latter half of the century, 
should temperature rise continue unabated. 
No country or region will be immune from the 
physical effects of climate change and envi -ronmental degradation, but the impact will 
vary—some regions will even see some mar -
ginal benefits in the form of longer growing 
seasons. In general, developing countries will 
suffer more as they lack the capacity to adapt 
to climate change and on average are more 
highly exposed to its effects. 
Melting Arctic and Sea Level Rise.  Tempera -
tures are warming at three times the global 
average in the Arctic largely as a result of feed -
back loops from melting ice and snow cover. 
This has caused mass loss from ice sheets and 
glaciers as well as reductions in sea ice extent The past ten years was the 
hottest on record, and every 
decade since the 1960s has been 
hotter than the previous one.

33and thickness. Globally, the sea level has risen 
an average of 8 to 9 inches since the late 19th 
century; estimates of rise in the next 20 years 
range from another 3 to 14 inches, which 
would create additional problems for low lying 
coastal cities and islands. On land, thawing 
permafrost is likely to cause increasing dam -
age to infrastructure, including transportation 
systems, pipelines, and power plants.More Intense Heat Waves.  Outside the Arc -
tic, the fastest warming is projected to occur 
in central and eastern North America, central 
Europe, the Mediterranean region (including 
southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near 
East), western and central Asia, and southern 
Africa. The tropics especially are expected to 
experience widespread extreme heatwaves. 
Extreme Weather and Weather Patterns. 
Warming temperatures are likely to create the 
atmospheric conditions for more intense and 
in some cases, more frequent natural disas -
ters, including stronger hurricane-strength 
storms, coastal flooding, storm surges, and 
droughts. Traditional weather patterns are 
also changing—for example, dry areas are ex -
pected to become drier, wet areas will become 
wetter, and precipitation will be less frequent 
but more intense in some areas. 
ADDING TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION 
During the next two decades, population 
growth, rapid urbanization, and poor land 
and resource management will increasingly 
intersect with and exacerbate climate change 
effects in many countries, particularly in the 
developing world. With coastal cities growing, 
more people than ever will be threatened by a 
combination of storm surges and sea level rise 
that worsen existing coastal erosion. 
Land Degradation.  The expansion and un -
sustainable management of agriculture and 
forestry practices degrade land, and both con -
tribute to and intensify the effects of climate 
change. A 2019 study found that global defor -
estation and land degradation each contribut -
ed to about 10 percent of all human-induced 
greenhouse gas emissions by releasing carbon 
stored in the trees and the soil. 
Water Misuse.  Poor water governance within 
and between states will remain the primary NARROWING CLIMATE  
UNCERTAINTIES 
Even though the Earth’s climate is an extremely complex, 
interconnected system that is sensitive to small chang -
es, increased data collection, computing power, and 
sophisticated modeling means that our understanding of 
climate change has become increasingly strong. Several 
areas of research are attempting to reduce uncertainty: 
Attribution: Scientists are improving their ability to 
attribute specific events after the fact to climate change. 
This nascent field, known as extreme event attribution, 
could change how publics perceive the growing threat 
and provide a basis for developing countries or impact -
ed communities to claim damages from high emitting 
countries or their government.
Feedback Loops: Scientists currently have a difficult 
time projecting when and to what extent positive 
feedback loops will drive further temperature increases 
and risk runaway warming. For example, the loss of 
reflective sea ice will reveal more of the ocean surface, 
which is dark and absorbs heat faster, in turn causing 
even more sea ice to melt. Another concerning feedback 
loop is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is 
released from wetlands, permafrost, and ocean hydrates 
in response to increased temperatures. 
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
34driver of water stress during the next two 
decades. As precipitation declines or becomes 
more erratic, population growth, economic 
development, and continued inefficient irri -
gation and agricultural practices will increase 
demand. In many river basins, upstream 
countries are building dams and altering water 
sources with little or no consultation with their 
downstream neighbors, such as the Grand 
Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, increasing the 
risk of conflict. 
Pollution.  Although air and water pollution 
have decreased in many high-income coun -
tries since a peak in the 20th century, they 
continue to grow globally as the number of 
middle-income countries has increased; for 
instance, 80 percent of industrial and munic -
ipal wastewaters are discharged untreated 
into waterways. Similar to other environmen -
tal factors, air pollution and climate change 
influence each other through complex interac -
tions in the atmosphere. Climate change will 
lead to more stagnation events—stationary 
domes of hot air that can cause air pollutants 
to get trapped and persist in the lower atmo -
sphere—and will worsen air quality by increas -
ing the frequency of wild fires. 
ERODING HUMAN SECURITY 
The physical impacts of a warmer world, 
combined with environmental degradation, 
are likely to lead to an array of human secu -
rity challenges, primarily but not exclusively 
in developing countries in the near term. 
According to a 2018 study, 36 percent of cities 
globally face acute environmental stress from 
droughts, floods, and cyclones; climate change 
will add to these. These challenges will com -
pound one another in coming years; as ex -
treme events become more intense and more 
frequent, societies may struggle to recover 
from one event before the next one hits. Exacerbating Food and Water Insecurity.  
Changing precipitation patterns, rising tem -
peratures, increased extreme weather events, 
and saltwater intrusion into soil and water 
systems from rising seas and storm surges are 
likely to exacerbate food and water insecu -
rity in some countries during the next two 
decades. Regions that remain dependent on 
rain-fed agriculture will be particularly vul -
nerable, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Central 
America, some areas of Argentina and Brazil, 
parts of the Andean region, South Asia, and 
Australia. By contrast, some higher latitude 
regions such as Canada, northern Europe, and 
Russia may benefit from global warming by 
lengthened growing seasons. 
Fisheries are also under threat from severe 
overfishing that climate change will further 
stress through oxygen depletion, rapid warm -
ing, and ocean acidification. Fishermen have 
to go further to catch fewer and smaller fish, 
potentially venturing into the territorial waters 
of other countries. In addition, warming ocean 
temperatures threaten to kill many more coral 
reefs—already they have declined by 30 to 50 
percent, and at 1.5°C warming, they could de -
cline by 70 to 90 percent—further threatening 
fishing and tourism industries. 
Threats to Human Health.  Decreased water, 
air, and food quality, along with changes in 
disease vectors and water-borne pathogens, 
all threaten human life. Death rates from 
pollution vary significantly across the world—
typically highest in middle-income countries 
in East and South Asia. In addition, extreme 
weather and disasters often kill people and 
disrupt health infrastructure and prevent 
access to care. Climate change is expected 
to change the geographic range and in some 
cases frequency of disease outbreaks affecting 
humans, animals, and plants, including those 
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD
35that are vector-borne (West Nile, malaria, Den -
gue), waterborne (cholera), airborne (influen -
za, hantavirus), and food-borne (salmonella). 
Loss of Biodiversity.  The variability among all 
living organisms—known as biodiversity—is 
declining faster than at any point in human 
history, risking food and health security and 
undermining global resilience. Warming 
temperatures are likely to lead to the extinc -
tion of plants and animals that can no longer 
survive in their traditional habitats or shift 
quickly to new locations as well as encourage 
the spread of invasive species that choke out 
native organisms. 
Increased Migration.  Extreme weather 
events increase the risk of more environmen -
tally-induced migration, which usually occurs 
within states as affected populations move 
to nearby communities, often temporarily. 
Climate change probably will exacerbate this 
as sea level rise or extreme heat makes certain 
locales permanently uninhabitable, although 
mainly after 2040, possibly causing permanent 
migration and movement to other states.
MITIGATION GAINING TRACTION
Efforts to set a path toward net zero green -
house gas emissions will intensify during the 
coming decade and spark increased debate 
about how and how soon to achieve this goal. 
The 2015 Paris Agreement set a global goal of 
limiting warming to less than 2°C, preferably 
to 1.5°C, and resulted in countries volunteer -
ing modest targets to reduce or establish a 
peak for their emissions. Although developed 
country emissions have continued to decline 
largely because of increased energy efficien -
cy and use of natural gas, and the COVID-19 
pandemic also caused a brief drop in global 
emissions—overall emissions have continued 
to increase. This trend has led to a growing 
number of countries making more ambitious pledges to become carbon neutral—such as 
Chile, the European Union (EU), Japan, New 
Zealand, and South Korea by 2050, and China 
by 2060. 
As climate modeling improves, divisions are 
likely to become more pronounced between 
those who advocate reaching net zero emis -
sions over decades by transitioning to new 
technologies and those who argue that net 
zero must be achieved more quickly to pre -
vent the worst outcomes. State pledges factor 
in advancements in technologies to mitigate 
emissions while boosting economic growth 
and assume that the worst effects of climate 
change can be avoided through a more 
gradual approach. Advocates of faster action 
argue that the window to avoid the cataclys -
mic effects is closing and that more dramatic, 
immediate behavioral changes are required. 
Limiting the global temperature increase to 
1.5°C will require unprecedented changes in 
energy consumption and production to allow 
developing countries to grow their economies 
while not offsetting the carbon reductions 
from developed countries.
Energy Transition Underway
A critical aspect of the global debate and the 
ability to mitigate climate change is the speed 
of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable 
energy. Even though fossil fuels will continue 
to supply the majority of energy needs during 
the next 20 years, wind and solar are almost 
certain to grow faster than any other energy 
source because of technological advances and 
falling costs, and nuclear power production 
may grow, particularly if new, safer designs 
emerge. Increasing energy efficiencies proba -
bly will also reduce the rate of energy demand 
growth and the carbon intensity per unit of en -
ergy used. A range of current and future tech -
nological developments—as well as regulatory 
and investment choices by governments,

37businesses, and consumers—will influence 
energy use in buildings, transportation, and 
power, which together account for a majority 
of global emissions. Many of these technolo -
gies could also contribute to greater energy 
resilience and self-sufficiency for states.
Increased Efforts To Remove  
Carbon Dioxide
The success of efforts to remove carbon diox -
ide from the atmosphere will also be critical. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change estimates that mitigating emissions 
alone almost certainly will not be enough to 
limit warming to 1.5°C, which increases the im -
portance of technologies that remove carbon 
dioxide from the atmosphere to use it or store 
it underground. Most of the modeled path -
ways to limit warming to 1.5°C involve a sub -
stantial expansion of carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) primarily through afforestation and 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage 
(BECCS). Other technologies being researched 
include soil sequestration, ocean fertilization, 
and direct air capture. Research into and a 
push to deploy BECCS—still a nascent technol -
ogy—almost certainly will increase because 
it is one of the few negative emissions tech -
nologies that exist because it uses carbon 
dioxide to grow biomass that is converted to 
usable energy while storing the carbon dioxide 
underground. Currently about 25 commercial -
ly operational CDR projects offset a negligible 
amount of yearly emissions, and efforts to 
scale up CDR will face policy, technological, 
and economic constraints absent market 
incentives. More countries may introduce a 
carbon tax, or a credit for removing carbon, in 
an effort to speed up CDR as well as broaden 
adoption of renewable energy technologies.
Complementary Actions on Emissions

al and governmental efforts to address climate KEY EMERGING  
ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES 
The cost to build and operate new  solar photovoltaic and 
wind-powered plants  is broadly cheaper than equivalent 
fossil fuel–fired power plants. Even more efficient, lower cost 
renewable technologies, such as perovskite solar cells, are 
poised to transform and disrupt energy industries in the next 
two decades. Moreover, increasingly connected wind turbine 
technology is enabling massive and lower-cost offshore wind 
projects worldwide. China is the world’s largest producer and 
exporter of solar panels and wind turbines. 
Advanced energy storage  will be needed to enable more 
renewables in grid systems and support broad deployment of 
electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries have seen large cost re -
duction and performance improvements in recent years, and 
investments are also increasing in potentially safer, cheaper, 
more powerful, and longer duration alternatives. In the fu -
ture, it is likely that advanced energy storage would allow for 
the development of decentralized and autonomous electrical 
grids that integrate batteries, renewable power sources, and 
electric vehicles and that potentially have no need for backup 
from fossil fuels.
Green hydrogen —produced through electrolysis with no 
by-products—has the potential to play a greater role in stor -
ing excess solar and wind energy and helping to decarbonize 
heating, industry, and heavy transport. The industry is still 
in its infancy, but costs are expected to come down because 
countries with cheap renewable energy sources are particular -
ly interested in it, such as Chile. 
Several companies are developing small modular nuclear 
reactors (SMRs) , about one-third the size of traditional nu -
clear reactors, which could lead to broader acceptance from 
countries traditionally opposed to nuclear projects because 
SMRs are smaller and safer. SMRs have the potential to 
provide power generation to remote areas, such as in Africa, 
which could help developing countries electrify their popula -
tions without increasing emissions. In addition, SMRs—when 
combined with solar and wind power—could help solve the 
problem of intermittency.
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
38and environmental challenges. Action at the 
local level has already increased, and a grow -
ing number of companies have pledged to go 
carbon neutral. Some large asset managers 
have concluded that climate change threat -
ens their long-term returns and are requiring 
carbon emissions disclosures from firms in 
their portfolios or declining to invest in some 
fossil fuel projects. In 2018, nearly 10,000 cities 
and municipalities in 128 countries took some 
form of climate action, as did 6,225 companies 
headquartered in 120 countries, represent -
ing $36.5 trillion in revenue, larger than the 
combined gross domestic product (GDP) of the 
United States and China. Public-private part -
nerships are becoming a preferred operating 
framework, partly a recognition that nonstate 
efforts are most effective when linked to 
state action. 
GROWTH OF RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION 
In addition to efforts to reach net zero emis -
sions, many countries and local communities 
will expand investment in adaptive infrastruc -
ture and resilience measures. Some measures 
are as inexpensive and simple as restoring 
mangrove forests or increasing rainwater stor -
age; others are as complex as building mas -
sive sea walls and planning for the relocation 
of large populations. A key challenge for these 
efforts will be funding for vulnerable commu -
nities—particularly as governments face com -
peting fiscal and political challenges and have 
to choose which communities to support. 
Public-private partnerships are innovating 
new insurance approaches aimed at building 
resilience to climate risks, such as insuring 
natural assets like the Mesoamerican reef off 
Mexico or index-based weather insurance for 
local farmers in Kenya. These approaches rely 
on new data and machine learning technolo -
gies—suggesting that as these technologies advance during the next 20 years, resilience 
mechanisms may become more sophisticated. 
Calls for Geoengineering
As warming gets closer to exceeding the Paris 
Agreement goals, it is increasingly likely that 
states and nonstate actors will more aggres -
sively research, test, and possibly deploy geo -
engineering measures—deliberate large-scale 
interventions in the earth’s natural systems—
to try to counteract climate change. Current 
research is largely focused on solar radiation 
management (SRM), an effort to cool the 
planet by reflecting the suns energy back into 
space. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), a 
form of SRM that sprays particles in the strato -
sphere to cause global dimming, has attracted 
funding by those who fear the worst of climate 
change. Proponents argue that the needed 
energy transformation will happen too slowly 
and that SAI can buy the planet time because 
it is technologically feasible and less expensive 
than mitigation. 
Current research is almost entirely in comput -
er models with academia, nongovernmental 
organizations, and private companies playing 
a leading role. However, there will be in -
creased calls for countries to begin engaging 
in the dialogue and possibly take leadership to 
develop international agreements that could 
help set research standards, ensure transpar -
ency in live tests, determine the legal frame -
work around if, how, and when to deploy SRM 
technologies, and monitor the effects. The 
possibly catastrophic unintended side effects 
are not well understood, and some scientists 
fear that SRM, while keeping temperatures 
down, would create unexpected and devastat -
ing changes in weather systems and rainfall 
patterns. Countries and nonstate actors de -
ploying it alone will increase the risk of conflict 
and blowback, especially when others blame 
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD
39them for a disaster they believe was caused 
by geoengineering.
BROADER IMPLICATIONS AND DISRUPTIONS
In addition to direct physical effects of climate 
change, states and societies are likely to be 
strained by hard choices and tradeoffs given 
the difficulty and costs of drastic emissions 
cuts and adaptive measures. The burden 
of these steps will not be evenly distributed 
within or between states, and the long-term 
payoff of mitigation policies runs counter to 
political incentives, making it difficult to sus -
tain controversial commitments. The second- 
and third-order implications of climate change 
will affect human and national security in 
several ways.
Drive Societal Cleavages and Political 
Movements. Concerns about climate change 
have grown across the globe with hundreds 
of thousands of protesters—mostly young 
people—marching in the streets advocating 
for faster change. Policy responses to mitigate 
or adapt to climate change also contribute 
to political volatility—particularly when they 
are linked to broader socio-political inter -
ests—such as the French protests against fuel 
price hikes in 2018. In Europe, nationalist and 
populist parties have capitalized on public 
concerns about the economic hardships 
associated with climate mitigation policies, 
and they have framed their opposition in 
terms of equality and social justice for working 
class populations. 
Increased Pressure for Global Action.  
As warming continues to rise, there will be 
more debate and tension among countries 
over transparency, cuts, and responsibility. 
Developing countries that want the room to grow their economies and increase emissions 
will more forcefully demand that developed 
countries provide them with advanced energy 
technologies to leapfrog their energy systems 
to a low carbon model. In addition, develop -
ing countries will increasingly demand that 
developed countries meet their commitments 
to provide financing to help vulnerable popu -
lations adapt. Greater demands will be made 
on international financing vehicles such as the 
Green Climate Fund, which has approved $4 
billion worth of adaptation projects. 
Heighten Competition.  Climate change and 
environmental degradation will contribute to 
and reflect a more contested geopolitical envi -
ronment. Countries and other actors are likely 
to compete over food, mineral, water, and 
energy sources made more accessible, more 
valuable, or scarcer. Receding Arctic sea ice 
is opening new sea routes and opportunities 
to access valuable resources there, including 
natural gas and oil deposits, rare earth met -
als, and fish stocks. Russia is building more 
icebreakers to patrol its northern coastline 
and project power as an Arctic leader, and 
even non-coastal states like China and India 
are seeking to take advantage of shorter trade 
routes and resources. In addition, China is try -
ing to boost its international image by claiming 
to be a leader on climate diplomacy despite 
its growing emissions—already the highest in 
the world.
Contribute to Instability and Conflict Risk.  
Rarely is climate change the sole or even pri -
mary driver of instability and conflict; however, 
certain socio-political and economic contexts 
are more vulnerable to climate sparks that 
ignite conflict. Countries of particular concern 
are those with ethnic or religious polariza -
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
40tion; livelihoods highly dependent on natural 
resources or agriculture; weak or illegitimate 
conflict resolution mechanisms; a history of 
violence; and low adaptive capacity. For exam -
ple, an increase in drought or extreme weath -
er may reduce the opportunity cost of joining 
armed groups for struggling farmers and herd -
ers, while sectarian elites may advance their 
polarizing political goals by exploiting local 
grievances exacerbated by climate change. 
Strain Military Readiness. While militaries 
will continue to adapt and fight in the chang -
ing world, climate effects will strain readiness 
and compound fiscal pressures on many 
militaries. Storm surges and sea level rise will 
force changes to the design and protection of 
naval bases and aircraft runways, prolonged 
extreme heat will limit training days, and 
major storms and floods will force militaries 
to divert more resources to disaster relief at 
home and abroad.
Increase Pressure on Strained International 
Systems.  Current international law and coop -
erative bodies are increasingly mismatched 
to global climate challenges. For example, 
international refugee law does not account for 
people displaced by climate change effects. 
Many existing organizations designed to help 
manage shared resources, such as the Arctic 
Council or the Nile Basin Initiative, may be 
overwhelmed or sidelined, given their volun -
tary nature and lack of enforcement mecha -
nisms. Also, efforts to develop international 
standards or regulations for high-risk activities 
like SRM lag behind the technology, increasing 
the possibility that countries or individuals will 
pursue unilateral action that risk blowback. ENERGY TRANSITION GEOPOLITICS  
AND ECONOMICS 
The transition from fossil fuels has the potential to signifi -
cantly reshape geopolitics and economics, depending on 
its speed and structure. Petro-states—currently accounting 
for 8 percent of world GDP and nearly 900 million citi -
zens—would face major revenue losses in an aggressively 
decarbonizing scenario. Those that can more efficiently and 
cheaply extract oil or diversify their economies will better 
weather the transition. 
In addition, the transition will diminish countries’ ability 
to use energy as a tool of coercion or statecraft because 
energy systems will become more decentralized. Countries 
will have decreased leverage in energy markets because 
oil and renewables operate differently; the former is an 
extracted resource that is traded, whereas the latter is 
harnessed by building out domestic infrastructure. As a 
result, it will be more difficult for any one country to affect 
others’ energy supply. For example, Chinese dominance of 
the clean energy equipment market does not allow Beijing 
to threaten global energy supplies in the way that control of 
the oil markets by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries once did. 
However, a shift to renewable energy will increase compe -
tition over certain minerals, particularly cobalt and lithium 
for batteries and rare earths for magnets in electric motors 
and generators. As actors race to develop new renewable 
energy technology during the next two decades, they will 
focus on countries that supply these minerals, such as the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Bolivia.Photo / Bigstock

Key Takeaways
During the next two decades, several global economic trends, including rising 
national debt, a more complex and fragmented trading environment, the global 
spread of trade in services, new employment disruptions, and the continued rise 
of powerful firms, are likely to shape conditions within and between states. 
Many governments may find they have reduced flexibility as they navigate greater 
debt burdens, diverse trading rules, and public pressure to deal with challenges 
that range from demographic shifts to climate change. 
Asian economies appear poised to continue decades of growth, although poten -
tially at a slower pace. Productivity growth will be a key variable globally; increased 
growth rates in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) countries would help governments deal with economic, demographic, 
and other challenges; and increased growth rate in Asia could help countries avoid 
the middle-income trap. STRUCTURAL FORCESGOVERNMENTS

43Over the next few decades, 
the economic costs of 
aging will strain public finances 
in all G20 economies, unless 
difficult decisions are made to 
either reduce benefits and/or 
raise taxes.
Economic trends during the next two decades 
probably will vary more than trends in de -
mography and climate. Economic forecasting 
is inherently uncertain and highly connected 
to other key trends, including technology, as 
well as government policies. In this section, we 
focus on several longer term economic trajec -
tories that are creating both opportunities and 
challenges for states and nonstate actors. 
HIGH NATIONAL DEBT ENDURING, RISING
National debt levels have risen in almost every 
country since the 2007-08 global financial 
crisis and are likely to continue to face up -
ward pressure through at least 2040. Strong 
borrowing in response to the COVID-19 pan -
demic, rising old-age dependency burdens in 
most of the largest economies, and increased 
demands on governments to spur economic 
growth as well as respond to other global chal -
lenges have all contributed to the debt levels. 
National debt to gross domestic product (GDP) 
ratios were higher in 2019 than in 2008 in 
almost 90 percent of advanced economies, in -
cluding the United States and Japan, and leapt 
upward in 2020 because of the pandemic and 
government responses. Average debt ratios in 
emerging markets in 2019 were comparable 
to those that prevailed during the debt crisis 
wave of the mid-1980s and 1990s. In 2019, the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessed that approximately two-fifths of low-income 
developing countries were at high risk of, or 
in, debt distress. During the next few decades, 
the economic costs of aging will strain public 
finances in all G20 economies, unless difficult 
decisions are made to reduce benefits or 
raise taxes. 
Reducing national debt ratios during the next 
20 years is likely to be even more challeng -
ing than during the decade that followed the 
financial crisis. The cost of providing health -
care and pensions in most of the largest 
economies, as well as paying for other social 
programs, will remain a drag on discretionary 
spending without major productivity gains 
or a reduction in the cost of these services. 
Slow economic growth in some economies 
could reduce tax revenues and impair govern -
ments’ ability to reduce spending because of 
the need to invest in economic recovery and 
infrastructure or respond to the effects of 
climate change. NATIONAL DEBT AS A

45Sustainable for Some, But Others at Height -
ened Risk of Default.  A prolonged period of 
low interest rates, similar to the post-financial 
crisis period, would increase the affordability 
of debt for some economies, including ad -
vanced economies in Asia, Europe, and North 
America, allowing them to sustain higher 
national debt ratios. The world’s major central 
banks, including the European Central Bank, 
the Federal Reserve, and the Bank of Japan, 
have pursued an ultra-low interest rate policy 
for at least the past decade, and most econ -
omists expect these countries to be able to 
sustain high debt ratios because they have 
borrowed in their own currency. Departures 
from this policy could increase debt servicing 
costs and increase the risks associated with 
high debt ratios. 
Emerging and developing economies that 
have financed at least some of their debt with 
external borrowing are at increased risk of 
debt distress and could face a debt crisis, even 
if global interest rates remain low, because 
local currency depreciation and increased 
risk premiums could increase servicing 
costs. Some governments are likely to face 
the choice of reining in public spending and 
risking public discontent, or maintaining public 
spending, which would further increase debt 
burdens and borrowing costs and risk local 
currency depreciation. Facing these choices, 
some governments are likely to prioritize 
spending on domestic issues rather than the 
global commons. 
DISRUPTIONS IN EMPLOYMENT
The global employment landscape will con -
tinue to shift because of new technologies, 
notably automation, online collaboration tools, 
artificial intelligence (AI), and perhaps addi -
tive manufacturing. Tasks that once seemed 
uniquely suited to human abilities, such as 
driving a car or diagnosing a disease, are already automated or potentially amenable 
to automation in the next decade. Studies 
have estimated that automation could elim -
inate 9 percent of existing jobs and radical -
ly change approximately one-third in the 
next 15 to 20 years. Emerging technologies 
will also create jobs and will enable greater 
virtual labor mobility through Internet-based 
freelance platforms that match customers 
with self-employed service providers as 
well as speed-of-light commercial data and 
software transmission.
Demographics, specifically aging populations, 
will promote faster adoption of automation, 
even with increases in the retirement age. 
Most of today’s largest economies will see 
their workforces shrink over the coming two 
decades as aging workers retire. South Korea 
is projected to lose 23 percent of its work -
ing-age population (age 15-64), Japan 19 per -
cent, southern Europe 17 percent, Germany 13 
percent, and China 11 percent during this peri -
od, if the retirement age remains unchanged. 
Automation—traditional industrial robots and 
AI-powered task automation—almost certainly 
will spread quickly as companies look for ways 
to replace and augment aging workforces 
in these economies. Automation is likely to 
spread more slowly in other countries, with 
the key being whether it offers cost advantag -
es, including over low-skilled labor. 
The number of jobs created by new technolo -
gies is likely to surpass those destroyed during 
the next 20 years, judging from past episodes. 
One study by the World Economic Forum 
estimates that by 2025, automation will have 
created 97 million new jobs and displaced 85 
million existing jobs. Several factors, including 
skills, flexibility, demographic factors, underly -
ing wages, the share of jobs susceptible to au -
tomation, and access to continuing education 
could influence how well individual countries 
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
46COULD 2040 BE JOBLESS? 
The breadth and speed at which AI could replace current 
jobs raises questions as to whether economies will have the 
capacity to generate sufficient new jobs and whether workers 
will have the requisite skills for the new jobs created. 
During the next few decades, AI appears likely to follow the 
trend of previous waves of innovation, resulting in net job cre -
ation over time, but it may lead initially to an overall decline if 
jobs disappear faster than new ones are created. 
Alternatively, some economists question whether AI could 
lead to more continuous disruption to labor markets, as 
machines rapidly gain in sophistication, resulting in more 
persistent job losses. are able to adapt to automation. For example, 
countries with growing working-age cohorts 
are likely to experience more employment 
dislocations or downward pressure on wages 
than countries with older populations at com -
parable levels of automation. 
Automation may affect a growing share of the 
workforce. During the past two decades, it has 
replaced mostly middle-skill job professions, 
such as machine operators, metal workers, 
and office clerks. Automation may increasingly 
affect more high-income professions, such 
as doctors, lawyers, engineers, and university 
faculty. Although new jobs will emerge, there 
is likely to be a skills mismatch between jobs 
lost and jobs created. This mismatch could 
lengthen the period of unemployment for 
many workers as they attempt to gain the 
skills required for newly created jobs, and it 
could further skew the distribution of gains. 
More youthful economies might be more 
agile if they are able to provide the education 
needed to properly train new entrants into 
the workforce. 
MORE FRAGMENTED TRADING ENVIRONMENT
The global trading system is likely to become 
even more fragmented during the next two 
decades. Since the creation of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, little or 
no progress has been made toward addi -
tional global trade agreements. Regional and 
bilateral trade agreements have proliferated, 
further fragmenting the global trading envi -
ronment. Only a single multilateral agreement, 
the Trade Facilitation Agreement, has been 
completed since the WTO’s inception. Progress 
has been limited by fundamental differences 
over agricultural trade and related subsidies 
and protection of intellectual property rights 
among member countries as well as by a wid -
ening divide between developed and develop -
ing countries. Lacking updates, current trade rules are inadequate for new types of flows, 
including e-commerce and other services. 
However, barriers to trade in global services, 
such as data localization rules, and the contin -
ued desire to protect domestic agriculture are 
likely to make future agreements to update 
the WTO even more difficult. 
As WTO rules become increasingly antiquat -
ed, future regional agreements are likely to 
establish new rules and standards, especially 
for new types of commercial transactions, 
resulting in further fragmentation of global 
trade rules. There has been a large increase 
in the number of bilateral and regional trade 
arrangements since the formation of the WTO, 
and more limited progress in sector-specific 
agreements. Some of these agreements not 
only cover tariffs and market access but also 
establish rules and standards in areas not cov -
ered by the WTO or other global multilateral 
agreements, such as the digital trade rules in 
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD
47the United States–Mexico-Canada Agreement. 
Larger agreements, including the Asia-focused 
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partner -
ship (2020), the Comprehensive and Progres -
sive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership 
(2018), and the Africa Continental Free Trade 
Area (2020), are likely to boost regional trade 
and could attract more foreign direct invest -
ment to these regions. 
Expanding unilateral, often non-tariff trade 
restrictions, are likely to further complicate 
international trade for governments and the 
private sector, limit trade-driven economic 
growth, and weaken overall growth. Although 
the US-China trade war has garnered head -
lines, many countries have increased their use 
of restrictive trade measures during the past 
12 years. Between 2008 and 2018, the number 
of restrictive trade-related policy measures 
implemented globally increased by more than 
200 percent compared to the previous decade, 
with Latin America and Asia accounting for 30 
percent and 40 percent respectively. In the Asia Pacific region, for example, non-tariffs 
measures have increased even as applied tar -
iffs have fallen. With a record number of new 
trade barriers in 2019, trade restrictions are 
becoming structurally ingrained in the Europe -
an Union’s (EU) trade relations. 
A combination of the desire to protect jobs 
in the manufacturing sector, concerns about 
capturing gains from winner-take-all techno -
logical progress, and a focus on critical inputs, 
such as medical equipment and pharmaceu -
tical feedstocks, is likely to further accelerate 
the use of protectionist trade policies. The 
anticipated increase in job losses in manufac -
turing during the next two decades is likely to 
place pressure on governments, particularly 
those in advanced and manufacturing-depen -
dent emerging economies, to take protective 
actions. In addition, a recognition that technol -
ogies, such as AI, could lead to sustainable first 
mover advantages—in which being the first to 
market a new product provides a competitive 
advantage—might lead some governments to

48intensify their use of trade restrictions as they 
jockey for global position. Finally, protecting 
critical inputs and strategic supplies, especially 
pharmaceuticals in the wake of the pandem -
ic, could lead to greater trade restrictions for 
these industries. 
China, the EU, Japan, and other economic 
powers will also use their leverage to advance 
national security goals, further distorting mar -
kets. Since 2008, they already have intensified 
their use of trade restrictions and domestic 
market regulations for strategic influence. 
Looking forward, concerns about privacy and 
control of data streams as well as trade in 
industrial goods and other technologies are 
likely to lead to even more activist trade poli -
cies for broader national security interests. 
ECONOMIC CONNECTEDNESS  
EVOLVING, DIVERSIFYING 
In addition to trade policies, demand for and 
the increased ability to deliver services across 
borders and the use of e-commerce platform 
technologies are likely to further transform 
economic connectedness, including the shape 
of global value chains, the location of foreign 
direct investment, and the composition and 
direction of trade. Despite the fragmenta -
tion of the global trading system, trade in a 
broad range of services, including financial, 
telecommunications, information, tourism, 
and others, is poised to increase during the 
next two decades. In OECD countries, services 
account for roughly 75 percent of GDP and 80 
percent of employment, but the current value 
of services trade globally is only one-third 
of that of manufactured goods, suggesting 
that there is significant room for growth. The 
WTO’s Global Trade Model estimates that 
global trade would grow by around 2 percent -
age points more than baseline growth through 2030 if countries adopted digital technologies, 
which would facilitate expansion of services 
trade and provide a further boost to continued 
growth in economic connectedness. 
New Manufacturing Technologies Shifting 
Trade. The configuration of global supply 
chains in 2020 largely reflected the importance 
of economies of scale and labor as a source 
of value creation in the manufacturing sector, 
leading to the centralization of production in a 
few lower wage locations, especially China. A 
large increase in the use of digital technologies UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF MONEY 
The financial sector is not immune from the technological 
changes that are transforming other industries. Digital 
currencies are likely to gain wider acceptance during the 
next two decades as the number of central bank digital 
currencies increase. China’s central bank launched its 
digital currency in 2020, and a consortium of central banks, 
working in conjunction with the Bank of International Set -
tlements, is exploring foundational principles for sovereign 
digital currencies. 
The introduction of privately issued digital currencies, such 
as Facebook’s proposed Libra, would further drive accep -
tance of digital currencies. The extent to which privately 
issued digital currencies will provide a substitute for the 
use of national or regional fiat currencies, including the US 
dollar and the euro, to settle transactions will depend on 
the regulatory rules that are established. 
The US dollar and the euro are also likely to face threats 
from other fiat currencies, the potency of which will depend

49and additive manufacturing might reduce the 
importance of economies of scale and labor 
as an input and encourage firms to move 
more production closer to markets. These new 
production technologies could diminish the 
attractiveness of locating production in China 
and accelerate the rate at which companies 
reorient their supply chains. 
E-Commerce Platform Economy Firms 
Enabling Global Trade.  Cloud computing, 
automation, big data analytics, AI, and other 
information technologies are enabling new 
distribution modes that expand access to in -
ternational markets for all sellers but especial -
ly for small and medium-sized enterprises that 
have historically faced high foreign market 
entry costs. E-commerce platform firms, which 
in 2020 included the Chinese firm Alibaba and 
America’s Amazon, are creating a marketplace 
that matches buyers and sellers independent 
of geographic location, providing a compar -
atively low-cost and low-risk way for firms to 
enter foreign markets, and increasing interna -
tional trade flows. 
E-commerce sales in 2018 were equivalent to 
30 percent of global GDP that year, according 
to data released in 2020. International e-com -
merce spanned business-to-business and 
business-to-consumer sales; approximately 25 
percent of all online shoppers made cross-bor -
der purchases in 2018. Looking forward, 
increased access to the Internet, falling data 
costs, growth in smartphone ownership, and 
a shift to online purchases post-pandemic 
are likely to result in more e-commerce sales, 
with many of these sales taking place on large 
global e-commerce platforms. 
Multinational “Superstar” Firms Perpetuate 
Economic Globalization.  Technology and dig -
itization are also transforming the structure of 
some industries, increasing the prevalence of 
oligopolies and near monopolies and resulting in global superstar or “winner-take-all” firms. 
Global superstar firms are the world’s larg -
est and most profitable across all industries, 
including pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, 
and information technology. These firms cap -
tured approximately 80 percent of economic 
profit among companies with annual revenues 
greater than $1 billion in 2017 and earned 
approximately 1.6 times more economic profit 
than they did in 1997. Superstar firms, while 
domiciled in a single country, have sales that 
are global, and growth in the size and reach 
of these firms is likely to translate into an 
increase in economic globalization. The eco -
nomic factors that support the rise of global 
superstar firms, including high fixed costs, low 
marginal costs, network and platform effects, 
and machine learning, are likely to persist 
through the next two decades.
Further, as technology, including big data and 
machine learning, and intangibles, such as 
brand, become increasingly important drivers 
of value creation during the next two decades, 
the market dominance of superstar firms is 
likely to increase. Growth in superstar firms 
is also likely to affect the division of economic 
gains between and within countries, poten -
tially leading to friction and uneven regulation 
as host economies try to capture some of 
the value created by these firms. The power 
of these firms beyond business—including 
control of data and information flows—will en -
courage government efforts to regulate them, 
essentially as public utilities, or possibly break 
them up. 
State Owned Multinationals Continue to 
Expand.  State-owned multinationals (SOM -
NCs), most of which originated in China, India, 
Russia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates 
(UAE), and some EU member countries, almost 
certainly will continue to be active participants 
in international commerce. Some SOMNCs

Labor productivity growth has fallen in most economies during 
the past two decades even as there have been large advances 
in technology. The next wave of technological improvements, 
including AI could reverse this trend. 
AI might have large effects on productivity during the next 
two decades, in line with the delayed nature of productivity 
gains from electricity and information technology. The pace of 
adoption could also affect productivity gains. According to one 
study, AI could boost global GDP by 1.2 percent per year if 70 
percent of companies adopted some form of AI by 2030. 
Although any gains are likely to be unequally distributed, both 
between and within countries, countries that are net gainers 
from an AI-induced productivity boost would have expanded 
economic opportunities that could allow them to deliver more 
services, reduce national debt levels, and finance some of the 
costs of an aging population.

GLOBAL TRENDS 204052may distort the global competitive landscape 
because of the state support that they receive. 
As the competition for technology leadership 
intensifies, SOMNCs, including those from 
China, could increase their reliance on state 
support to capture and lock-in first mover 
advantages, prompting private companies 
to lobby their governments to intervene on 
their behalf. 
CONTINUED TILT TOWARD ASIA
Global economic activity has been tilting 
toward Asia during the past 40 years, re -
flecting its higher rate of economic growth 
in comparison with the rest of the world, 
large population, and reduction in grinding 
poverty—a trend that almost certainly will 
continue through at least 2030 and perhaps through 2040. Some of the most populous 
countries in Asia are positioned to be among 
the world’s largest economies by 2040, even 
as their per capita income lag behind that of 
advanced economies. 
Asia’s record growth during the past 40 years 
has resulted in a convergence between Asian 
standards of living and those of middle- and 
even high-income economies. In 2020, China 
and other developing Asia countries contrib -
uted 18 percent and 7 percent respectively to 
global GDP. If these trends continue, by 2040 
developing countries in Asia are projected 
to account for approximately 35 percent of 
global GDP, with India and China as the largest 
contributors at 29 percent of global GDP, ac -
cording to Oxford Economics. 
The faster economic growth in Asia could lead 
to some of the most populous countries being 
among the world’s largest economies by 2040. 
For example, faster economic growth in In -
dia—on track to be the most populous country 
by 2027—could propel India into the ranks of 
the world’s three largest economies. Similarly, 
faster growth in Indonesia, the world’s fourth 
most populous country, could allow it to break 
into the ranks of the top 10 economies by 
2040. However, their standards of living or 
per capita GDP are likely to remain well below 
those of advanced economies. 
BROADER IMPLICATIONS AND DISRUPTIONS 
The economic environment of the future, 
characterized by increasing national debt, a 
more complex trading environment, diver -
sified global connections, and employment 
disruptions, will increase strains on govern -
ments. Taken together, these trends are likely Photo / BigstockPhoto / Bigstock
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD53to shift economic influence to a broader range 
of players, including private corporations and 
less open economies, led by China. 
Straining Contributions to Global 
Challenges . High national debt, and associ -
ated debt servicing costs, could restrict the 
financial contribution that governments are 
able and willing to make toward global public 
goods and to address shared challenges, 
including global health and climate change. 
Wealthy countries might cut back on health 
assistance programs—or be unable to expand 
them to match population increases in poor 
countries. Less investment could delay emis -
sions mitigation measures, and developed 
countries could backtrack on commitments to 
provide adaptation financing to the develop -
ing world. Slower growth and high debt could 
also limit the ability of some governments, in -
cluding those in developing countries most at 
risk from the adverse effects of climate, from 
investing in adaptation measures to protect 
their infrastructure and communities from 
extreme weather. 
Platformization Spurring Economic Growth.  
E-commerce platform firms will not only 
sustain globalization by matching customers 
and businesses across borders, but they can 
also facilitate growth in domestic business by 
offering a marketplace for domestic firms and 
customers to meet. The rise of e-commerce 
platform firms could help spur the growth of 
small and medium-sized enterprises, which 
have historically made a significant contri -
bution to economic growth and job creation. 
These small and medium-sized firms often face funding constraints, but e-commerce plat -
form firms offer lower customer acquisition 
costs and potentially greater market reach 
that could reduce costs, increase financing, 
and enable faster growth. In developing and 
emerging markets, these platform firms could 
lower the barriers to entry, help unlock financ -
ing, and provide an avenue to formalization 
of the underground economy. Greater regula -
tion of platform firms—particularly by coun -
tries trying to impose trade barriers—might 
reduce gains.
Increasing Challenges to International 
Economic Governance.  The number of large 
but still developing economies and their 
relative economic weight are likely to increase 
during the next 20 years. These economies, 
led by China, could increasingly demand more 
influence over the direction of economically 
focused international organizations, altering 
standards and norms to reflect their economic 
interests, some of which may be incompati -
ble with the interest of advanced economies. 
Other frictions might emerge because these 
economies are large in aggregate but still 
considered developing based on per capita 
GDP, giving them access to concessions from 
the IMF, World Bank, and WTO. These ten -
sions could shape the future orientation and 
undermine the effectiveness of these orga -
nizations, as well as result in the creation of 
more parallel organizations and increase the 
influence of developing economies on global 
economic rules. Photo / Bigstock54TECHNOLOGY
Key Takeaways
During the next two decades, the pace and impact of technological developments 
are likely to increase, transforming and improving human experiences and ca -
pabilities and offering the potential to tackle challenges such as aging, climate 
change, and low productivity growth, while creating new tensions and disruptions 
within and between societies, industries, and states. 
The next decades will see increasing global competition for the core elements 
of technology supremacy, such as talent, knowledge, and markets, potentially 
resulting in new technological leaders or hegemonies. 
The race for technological dominance is inextricably intertwined with evolving 
geopolitics and the broader US-China rivalry, but at the same time, technolog -
ical advantage will be augmented by companies that have a long-term focus, 
resources, and global reach. 
Spin off technologies and applications will be available for rapid adoption, en -
abling developing countries to take advantage of the latest core advances, develop 
global applications in niche areas, and contribute to global supply chains.STRUCTURAL FORCESPhoto / Bigstock

55The increasing convergence 
of seemingly unrelated 
fields and the rise of global 
competition to generate 
and lock in advantage are 
accelerating the emergence  
of cutting-edge technologies.
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
56Assessing technological trends and their 
broader implications is challenging because 
timelines remain uncertain, the path from 
foundational science to a transformational 
application can be difficult to discern, and the 
connections between a technology and its 
potential broader implications can be indirect 
and complex. Emerging technologies also raise 
myriad ethical, societal, and security ques -
tions—ranging, for example, from who we are 
as humans, to our impact on the environment, 
to the bounds of acceptable warfare. 
TRENDS ACROSS EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
Multiple trends are shaping the technology 
landscape of the next two decades, and while 
new technologies will not emerge uniformly 
or predictably, they are likely to share some 
common drivers and dynamics. The increasing 
convergence of seemingly unrelated fields 
and the rise of global competition to gener -
ate and lock-in advantage are accelerating 
the emergence of cutting-edge technologies. 
The diffusion of technological knowledge, 
the aggressive setting of standards to favor 
one technology solution over another, and 
ever shorter product development timelines 
will incentivize long-term strategy and rapid 
decisionmaking to avoid missteps and falling 
behind competitors. Scientific Convergence Sparking Innova -
tion.  The convergence of seemingly unrelated 
areas of scientific research and technological 
applications is making the rapid development 
of novel applications possible, practical, and 
useful. For example, the smartphone was 
enabled by decades of basic research and 
development in electronics, antennas, materi -
als, batteries, telecommunications networks, 
and user interfaces. By 2040, the increasing 
convergence of technologies, such as artificial 
intelligence (AI), high-speed telecommunica -
tions, and biotechnology, will be augmented 
by increased understanding of the social and 
behavioral sciences to enable rapid break -
throughs and user customized applications 
that are far more than the sum of their parts. 
Taken together, these technology platforms 
can then provide a foundation for rapid 
innovation while lowering the barriers to 
market entrance.
Growing Competition for Dominance.  The 
race for technological dominance is inextrica -
bly intertwined with evolving geopolitics and 
is increasingly shaped by broader political, 
economic, and societal rivalries, particularly 
those associated with China’s rise. Amassing 
the resources to sustain broad technology 
leadership, including the concentration of 
human talent, foundational knowledge, and 
supply chains, requires decades of long-term 
investment and visionary leadership. Those 
focusing their resources today are likely to be 
the technology leaders of 2040. In open econ -
omies, a mix of private efforts and partner -
ships between governments, private corpo -
rations, and research programs will compete 
with state-led economies, which may have 
an advantage in directing and concentrating Photo / Bigstock
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD57resources, including data access, but may 
lack the benefits of more open, creative, and 
competitive environments. 
Technologies Diffusing Globally.  Spin off 
technologies and applications are often 
available for rapid adoption in nearly every 
region of the world, enabling even developing 
countries to take advantage of the latest core 
advances, develop global applications in niche 
areas, or contribute to the supply chains of 
more advanced economies. Many states will 
seek to accelerate and harness this process, 
sponsoring focused efforts, such as regional 
alternatives to Silicon Valley or biotechnol -
ogy incubators that will increase the risk of 
surprise from novel applications arising from 
unexpected locations. 
Timelines Shrinking.  The time to develop, 
deploy, mature, and then retire technologies is 
moving from decades to years and sometimes 
faster. Multiple actors, including corporations 
and states, at the forefront of emerging tech -
nology may deploy and exploit a new technol -
ogy before others get off the starting blocks. 
Those trying to catch up, especially in devel -
oping countries, may be increasingly forced to 
choose technologies before the implications of 
those choices are fully understood, risking in -
vestment in technological dead ends or falling 
hopelessly behind. Planned economies may be 
able to react faster to emerging technology de -
velopments, potentially at the cost of reduced 
technological diversity and efficiency.

Artificial Intelligence  
Becoming Mainstream
AI is the demonstration of cognition and cre -
ative problem solving by machines rather than 
humans or animals, ranging from narrow AI, designed to solve specific problems, to Artifi -
cial General Intelligence, a system that in the 
future may match or exceed a human being’s 
understanding and learning capacity. By 2040, 
AI applications, in combination with other 
technologies, will benefit almost every aspect 
of life, including improved healthcare, safer 
and more efficient transportation, personal -
ized education, improved software for ev -
eryday tasks, and increased agricultural crop 
yields. Political and business leaders world -
wide are seeking global talent and are pouring 
resources into developing AI, hoping to be 
among the first to use it to reshape societies, 
economies, and even war. Enabled by concur -
rent increases in high-quality data, computing 
capability, and high-speed communication 
links, AI will challenge leaders to keep pace and reap the benefits while mitigating harmful 
effects, such as threats to privacy and liberty. 
Although many new AI developments will be 
available globally, there are disproportion -
ate advantages for nations that can afford to 
support, develop, and adopt AI now. Wide -
spread adoption of AI, particularly in warfare, 
also increases the risk of intentional misuse or 
unintended engagement or escalation. 
Industry and Labor Transformed.  AI will 
transform almost all industries and disrupt 
the global labor force, creating new job fields, 
eliminating others, and driving significant eco -
nomic and social redistributions. Human-ma -
chine teaming will be common for many 
future jobs. To harness the advantages of AI 
while mitigating unemployment, countries and 
corporations will need to focus on education 
and retraining their workforce. 
Data Will Be King. AI dependent industries 
and organizations of the future will require 
massive quantities of data to operate efficient -
ly and competitively. Institutions, companies, 
and countries already investing in ways to 
acquire, classify, store, and monetize data 
will have advantages. The unprecedented 
amounts of data available in 2040 will provide 
valuable insights and capabilities but also 
open up access, privacy, ownership, and con -
trol of data as areas of increasing competition 
and conflict. 
Security and Privacy Reimagined.  Current 
notions of privacy will continue to evolve, with 
individuals needing to share more personal 
information for access to applications, and 
tracking becoming ubiquitous. Authoritarian 
governments are likely to exploit increased 
data to monitor and even control their popula -
tions. Moreover, many companies and orga -nizations will also have powerful tools such as 
video manipulation, or deep fakes, to improve 
tailored marketing or advance a particular 
narrative. Emerging AI applications may also 
become potential targets for data manipula -
tion to skew their output. 
Ethics of Autonomy.  AI’s development and 
the level of human involvement in decision -
making, if any, will continue to raise ethical 
concerns, and perspectives on ethical obliga -
tions are likely to be differ globally. In addi -
tion, the opaque nature of AI decisionmaking 
increases the possibility of unintentional 
bias, discrimination, unexpected outcomes, 
or intentional misdirection. Cooperation to 
advance trustworthy AI, with transparent and 
clear decisionmaking processes, may improve 
trust and confidence for all parties. Although 
many countries will develop strict rules on the 
use of personal data, there will be debate on 
whether these rules can coexist with the full 
realization of AI capabilities. 
AI Enhanced Warfare.  AI will confer strong 
advantages to countries that incorporate AI 
into their military systems. AI will enhance the 
performance of existing weapons, defenses, 
and security systems, both physical and cyber, 
while counter-AI techniques, designed to 
negate or confuse AI decision making, also are 
likely to emerge. 
Smart Materials and Manufacturing 
Are Building a New World 
By 2040, advances in novel materials, cou -
pled with smart manufacturing, will reshape 
the production of everything from consumer 
goods to high-end military systems, reducing 
costs, extending capabilities, shifting supply 
chains, and enabling entirely new design 
options. The period of rapid change we are 
entering is often referred to as a Fourth 
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD
59Industrial Revolution because of its potential 
to improve standards of living while possibly 
disrupting traditional industries, jobs, supply 
chains, and business models. 
Materials and manufacturing are inextrica -
bly linked in a long-standing virtuous cycle, 
where advances in one drive advances in the 
other. Although this cycle alone could contin -
ue to drive progress for decades to come, it 
most likely will be accelerated by convergent 
advances in high performance computing, 
materials modeling, AI, and bio-materials. 
Increased connectivity will complement this 
growth by allowing advances to be distributed 
and accessible across the globe.
Increased Design Options.  Additive man -
ufacturing (AM), more commonly known as 
3D printing, is being used to fabricate an 
increasing variety of materials, from titanium 
to explosives, in smaller facilities and with less 
expertise, bringing advanced manufacturing 
capabilities to small companies and individu -
als worldwide. Despite some technical hurdles 
and questions of reliability, AM is driving a rev -
olution in modern manufacturing by enabling 
rapid prototyping, highly customized parts, on-
site production, and the fabrication of shapes 
that would otherwise be impossible. 
Adapting On The Fly.  Advances in informa -
tion systems, including computational mod -
eling and machine learning, combined with 
advanced physical systems, such as a robust 
industrial Internet of Things and advanced 
robotics, are likely to enable fully integrated, 
collaborative manufacturing systems that 
respond in real time to meet changing condi -
tions in the factory, in the supply network, and 
in demand. Design What You Need.  Materials today are 
undergoing a revolutionary transformation, 
shifting from off-the-shelf materials to opti -
mized materials and processes designed for 
custom products. Combined with additive 
manufacturing, materials-by-design will en -
able great strides in making everything from 
airplanes to cell phones stronger, lighter, and 
more durable.
Assemble What You Need.  The coming 
decades will see advances in the development 
of new materials with previously unobtainable 
properties, enabling previously unreachable 
levels of performance for many applications. 
Two-dimensional materials, metamaterials, 
and programmable matter will have unusu -
al strength, flexibility, conductivity, or other 
properties that enable new applications. 
Biotechnology Enabling Rapid Innovation
Improved capability to predictably manipulate 
biological systems, augmented by advances 
in automation, information, and materials 
sciences, is spurring unprecedented innova -
tion in health, agriculture, manufacturing, and 
cognitive sciences. By 2040, biotechnology 
innovations most likely will enable societies 
to reduce disease, hunger, and petrochem -
ical dependence and will transform how we 
interact with the environment and each other. 
Societies will be challenged to harness these 
beneficial advancements while addressing the 
market, regulatory, safety, and ethical con -
cerns surrounding these technologies—for ex -
ample, genetically modified crops and foods. 
Biotechnology is likely to make significant con -
tributions to economic growth during the next 
two decades, potentially affecting 20 percent 
of global economic activity by 2040, notably 
in agriculture and manufacturing, based on

61NEW TECHNOLOGIES FUELING SPACE  
COMMERCE AND SPARKING COMPETITION
The space landscape in 2040 will combine emerging technology with a maturation of today’s capabili -
ties to help drive commercialization and introduce new applications. Services, such as communications, 
navigation, and satellite imagery, will become ubiquitous offering improved capabilities, lower costs, and 
increasing efficiencies. The efforts of both government and commercial actors will establish new domains of 
space competition, particularly between the United States and China.
Space Exploration Expands 
By 2040, an increasing number of countries will be participating in space exploration as part of internation -
al cooperative efforts. By doing so, these countries will acquire national prestige, opportunities for scientific 
and technical advancement, and potential economic benefits. Although governments will remain the 
primary source of funding to support large-scale space exploration activities, the role of commercial entities 
will expand dramatically in most aspects of space activities. Commercial efforts will coexist, and probably 
cooperate, with government-funded space programs, advancing space technologies. 
China As A Space Power 
By 2040, China will be the most significant rival to the United States in space, competing on commercial, 
civil, and military fronts. China will continue to pursue a path of space technology development indepen -
dent of that involving the United States and Europe and will have its own set of foreign partners participat -
ing in Chinese-led space activities. Chinese space services, such as the Beidou satellite navigation system, 
will be in use around the world as an alternative to Western options.
Space Supporting Government and Military Needs 
Enhanced space services and new technology will be available for military applications as well as civil 
government and commercial use. National space assets will be particularly coveted as governments remain 
concerned about the possibility that commercial or foreign government space services could be denied in 
conflict. 
On-Orbit Activities Become Routine 
By 2040, governments probably will conduct routine on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing activ -
ities, enabled by advanced autonomy and additive manufacturing, to support national space systems and 
international efforts. Commercial companies probably will offer on-orbit services, such as repair, remote 
survey, relocation, refueling, and debris removal. On-orbit services will be used to upgrade satellites, ex -
tend their functional lives, and allow for new types of space structures, such as extremely large or complex 
instruments, but they may need government support to establish the industry.
AI Goes to Space 
AI will allow innovative use of space services by assisting with operation of large satellite constellations and 
space situational awareness capabilities. AI will also support the fusion and analysis of enormous volumes

domestic product (GDP). In 2019, the United 
States estimated its bioeconomy at nearly $1 
trillion dollars annually, or approximately 5.1 
percent of its total economy, while European 
Union and UN estimates from 2017-19, which 
apply a broader definition of bioeconomic 
activities, show biotech contributing as much 
as 10 percent to Europe’s economy. 
Hyperconnectivity Uniting and 
Separating Societies
By 2040, the world will have orders-of-mag -
nitude more devices, data, and interactions, 
linking together all aspects of modern life and 
crossing political and societal boundaries. In -
creasing speed and global access will provide 
nations, corporations, and even individuals 
with services and resources once limited to 
prosperous countries. This hyperconnected 
world is a future already beginning to emerge; 
next generation networks, persistent sensors, 
and myriad technologies will fuse together 
in a global system with billions of connected 
devices. Today’s ubiquitous public cameras, 
for example, will lead to tomorrow’s smart 
cities, where optical and other sensors com -
bine with AI to monitor people, vehicles, and 
infrastructure globally. 
By some estimates, the current Internet of 
Things, a precursor to a hyperconnected 
future, will reach 64 billion objects by 2025, 
up from 10 billion in 2018—all monitored in 
real time. Looking forward, a hyperconnected 
world could support up to 1 million devices 
per square kilometer with next generation 
cell phone systems (5G), compared with the 
60,000 devices currently possible with current 
cell networks, with even faster networks on 
the horizon. Networked sensors will become 
ubiquitous; more than 20 billion devices were 
operative in 2020, and with new terrestrial 
networks combined with an increase in space-based services, it is projected that hundreds of 
billions and eventually trillions of devices may 
be connected globally. 
Accelerated Societal Change. Privacy and 
anonymity may effectively disappear by choice 
or government mandate, as all aspects of 
personal and professional lives are tracked 
by global networks. Real-time, manufactured 
or synthetic media could further distort truth 
and reality, destabilizing societies at a scale 
and speed that dwarfs current disinformation 
challenges. Many types of crimes, particularly 
those that can be monitored and attributed 
with digital surveillance, will become less com -
mon while new crimes, and potentially new 
forms of discrimination, could arise. 
New Cybersecurity Paradigms.  Greater 
connectivity almost certainly will increase the 
vulnerability of connected individuals, insti -
tutions and governments as the presence of 
hundreds of billions of connected devices vast -
ly increases the cyber-physical attack surface. 
In addition, cyber security enforcement based 
on geographic borders is likely to become less 
relevant in an increasingly global web.
BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF 
TECHNOLOGY EVOLUTION 
Emerging technologies are rapidly improving 
a broad range of human experiences and ca -
pabilities, but at least in the short term, these 
same technologies may disrupt longstanding 
systems and societal dynamics, forcing individ -
uals, communities, and governments to adjust 
and find new ways of living, working, and man -
aging. As with any disruption, some will thrive 
whereas others will struggle, potentially facing 
increasing inequalities and imbalances. Emerg -
ing technologies are not solely responsible for 
the following developments, but they are likely 
to aggravate and amplify them. NASA / Unsplash
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD63Images / BigstockSolving Problems Fast.  As the global 
COVID-19 vaccine development effort has 
showcased, technologies—often integrated 
in new and imaginative ways—can be quickly 
reapplied from their original use to solve crisis 
needs. The research that enabled the unprec -
edented and rapid development of effective 
COVID-19 vaccines built on decades of foun -
dational investments in the health sciences. 
Similarly, challenges decades in the making, 
such as climate change, may be moderated 
by bringing together suites of technological 
solutions that each address one element of a 
much larger issue. 
Technology as Geopolitical Power.  Technol -
ogy is a tool of national power that the United 
States has long led through investments in re -
search, innovation, and development. The next 
decades will see increasing global competition 
for the core elements of technology suprem -
acy, such as talent, knowledge, and markets, 
potentially resulting in new technological 
leaders or hegemonies in the 2030s. Complex 
international supply chains, the global diffu -
sion of innovation, and investments by geopo -
litical rivals could further impede the unilateral 
use of technology by nations to achieve their 
goals. Conditions are ripe for both greater 
international cooperation as well as new types 
of multifaceted competition and conflict that 
could define the coming era. 
Aggravating Social Tensions.  The pace of 
technological change could increase societal 
tensions between those with the access, abili -
ty, and will to adapt and those who are unable 
or unwilling to change. With the rapid spread 
and adoption of technologies, some individu -
als, communities, and countries could make 
rapid advancements while others may be left 
behind with little hope of catching up, exacer -
bating inequalities within and between states. 
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
64Images / BigstockTechnological adoption also may outpace 
ethical maturity and regulation, creating per -
sistent and potentially corrosive social anxiety 
and political divisions. These tensions could be 
further inflamed by the use of manufactured 
or AI targeted messaging such as deep fakes. 
Complicating Government-Corporate Re -
lationships.  Public-private partnerships for 
investment, research, and development have 
been critical for attaining many technological 
breakthroughs and advantages, but core cor -
porate and national interests do not naturally 
align. Large technology companies increasing -
ly have resources, reach, and influence that ri -
vals and even surpasses some states. National 
interests in maintaining technological control 
and advantage as well as protecting national 
security can be at odds with corporate inter -
ests in expanding global market share and 
increasing profits. 
Disrupting Industries and Jobs.  The pace of 
technological change, notably developments 
in advanced manufacturing, AI, and biotech -
nology, may hasten disruptions to manufac -
turing and global supply chains, eliminating 
some modes of production and jobs and 
bringing supply chains closer to markets. 
Shifting supply chains could disproportionate -
ly affect less advanced economies, while many 
new jobs will require workers with improved 
or retooled skills. 
Enabling Governance, Threatening Free -
dom and Privacy.  The technology-saturated 
and hyperconnected future will offer leaders 
and governments new tools to monitor their 
populations, enabling better service provision 
and security but also offering greater means 
of control. The same technologies that em -
power citizens to communicate, organize, and monitor their health are providing increasing 
amounts of data to governments and the 
private sector. Governments, especially au -
thoritarian governments, will exercise unprec -
edented surveillance capabilities to enforce 
laws and provide security while tracking and 
de-anonymizing citizens and potentially target -
ing individuals.
Stimulating Debates Over Openness.  The 
prospects of a hyperconnected world will 
stimulate debates and divisions within and 
between states about the benefits and risks of 
open, connected networks. As global networks 
become increasingly interconnected, it may 
be more difficult to maintain a segregated or 
closed system, and efforts to block the broad -
er Internet potentially could irreparably cut off 
closed systems from the global economy. 
Existential Risks.  Technological advanc -
es may increase the number of existential 
threats; threats that could damage life on a 
global scale challenge our ability to imagine 
and comprehend their potential scope and 
scale, and they require the development of re -
silient strategies to survive. Technology plays a 
role in both generating these existential risks 
and in mitigating them. Anthropomorphic 
risks include runaway AI, engineered pandem -
ics, nanotechnology weapons, or nuclear war. 
Such low-probability, high-impact events are 
difficult to forecast and expensive to prepare 
for but identifying potential risks and devel -
oping mitigation strategies in advance can 
provide some resilience to exogenous shocks. 
 
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD
6566While these demographic, environmental, economic, and tech -
nological trends are setting the stage, the story of the next 20 
years will be written primarily by the choices made at societal, 
state, and international levels. Emerging dynamics at all levels point to greater 
debate and contestation. Personal and policy choices will determine the co -
hesiveness of societies, the resilience of states in all regions, and the types of 
interactions between states. 
In many countries, people are pessimistic about the future and growing more 
distrustful of leaders and institutions that they see as unable or unwilling to deal 
with disruptive economic, technological, and demographic trends. In response, 
people are gravitating to familiar and like-minded groups for community and 
security, including ethnic, religious, and cultural identities as well as groupings 
around interests and causes. Communities are more fragmented and in conflict; 
a cacophony of competing visions, goals, and beliefs are placing greater de -
mands on governments. EMERGING DYNAMICS
Image / BigstockA MORE CONTESTED WORLD67INTERNATIONALAt the same time, governments are struggling under mounting pressures and tighter re -
sources, and they are finding it difficult to meet the challenges of a globally interconnected, 
technologically advanced, and diverse world. The result is a growing disequilibrium between 
public demands and governments’ ability to deliver welfare and security, portending greater 
political volatility and increasing risks for democracy. Unmet needs and expectations are en -
couraging a flourishing mar -
ketplace of additional actors 
providing governance, secu -
rity, and services, including 
nongovernmental organiza -
tions, churches, corporations, 
and even criminal organiza -
tions. States that adapt to the 
mounting governance chal -
lenges probably will be better 
positioned to rebuild trust and 
legitimacy. 
During the next two decades, power in the international system will evolve to include a 
broader set of sources and features with expanding technological, network, and information 
power complementing more traditional military and economic power. The rivalry between the 
United States and China is likely to set the broad parameters for the geopolitical environment 
during the coming decades, forcing starker choices on other actors. States will leverage these 
diverse sources of power to jockey over global norms, rules, and institutions, with regional 
powers and nonstate actors exerting more influence within individual regions and leading 
on issues left unattended by the major powers. The increased competition over internation -
al rules and norms, together with untested technological military advancements, is likely to 
undermine global multilateralism, broaden the mismatch between transnational challenges 
and institutional arrangements to tackle them, and increase the risk of conflict.SOCIETAL

RISING PESSIMISM, WAVERING TRUST
Global and local challenges, including econom -
ic strains, demographic shifts, extreme weath -
er events, and rapid technological change, are 
increasing perceptions of physical and social insecurity for much of the world’s population. The COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying these economic and social challenges. Many people, particularly those who are benefiting less than others in their societies, are increasingly pes -
simistic about their own prospects, frustrated with government performance, and believe governments are favoring elites or pursuing the wrong policies. The economic growth and rapid improvements in health, education, and human development of the past few decades have begun to level off in some regions, and people are sensitive to the increasing gap between winners and losers in the globalized economy and are seeking redress from their governments. Approximately 1.5 billion people moved up into the middle class in the past few decades, but some are beginning to fall back, including in advanced economies. 
Public opinion polls repeatedly have shown 
increasing pessimism about the future in countries of all types around the world, but especially in advanced and middle-income economies. According to the 2020 Edelman Trust Barometer, the majority of respondents in 15 of 28 countries po lled are pessimistic 
that they and their families will be better o ff 
in five years, an average increase of 5 percent 
from the previous year. Less than a quarter of 
those polled in France, Germany, and Japan, 
for example, believe they will be better off 
in 2025. In coming years, this pessimism is 
likely to spread in developing countries with 
large youthful populations but with slowing 
progress in eradicating poverty and meet -
ing human development needs, particularly 
Sub-Saharan Africa.
Potentially slower economic growth in coming 
years and smaller gains in human develop -
ment in many countries are likely to exacer -
bate distrust of institutions and formal so urces 
of authority fo r some members of the public . 
Trust in governments and institutions, which 
is highly dependent on perceptions of fairness 
and effectiveness, has been consistently low 
for the past decade, particularly in middle- to 
high-income countries. In a 2020 study of 16 
developed countries by Edelman, the po rtion 
of the mass public  trusting government since 
2012 never exceeded 45 percent, and among 
Organization for Econo mic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) economies, public trust 
in government fell in more than half o f coun -
tries between 2006 and 2016, according to 
separate public opinion polling by Gallup. Of 
11 geographically diverse countries analyzed 
by Edelman during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
pub-l ic trust in government increased an 
average of 6 percentage points between 
January and May 2020, and then it declined an 
average of 5 percentage points between May 
2020 and January 2021 as governments failed

pervasive surveillance and monitoring 
by governments and fear private cor -
porations seeking control or profit from 
their personal information. 
IDENTITIES MORE PROMINENT
As trust in governments, elites, and other 
established institutions erodes, societies are 
likely to fragment further based on identities 
and beliefs. People in every region are turn -
ing to familiar and like-minded groups for 
community and a sense of security, including 
cultural and other subnational identities as 
well as transnational groupings and interests. 
Identities and affiliations are simultaneously 
proliferating and becoming more pronounced. 
In turn, this is leading to more influential roles 
for identity groups in societal and politi -
cal dynamics but also generating divisions 
and contention. 
Many people are gravitating to more estab -
lished identities, such as ethnicity and nation -
alism. In some countries, slowing population 
growth, increasing migration, and other demo -
graphic shifts are intensifying perceptions of 
vulnerability, including a sense of cultural loss. 
Many people who feel displaced by rapid so -
cial and economic changes resent violations of 
age-old traditions and perceive that others are 
benefiting from the system at their expense. 
These perceptions also fuel beliefs that eco -
nomic and social change is damaging and that 
some leaders are pursuing misguided goals. 
Consistent with the growing salience of es -
tablished identities, religion continues to play 
important roles in people’s lives, shaping what 
they believe, whom they trust, with whom they 
congregate, and how they engage publicly. 
In developing regions where populations are 
growing fastest, including Africa, South Asia, and parts of Latin America, publics report 
greater participation in religious practices, 
pointing to the sense of purpose religion pro -
vides. Perceptions of existential threats from 
conflict, disease, or other factors also contrib -
ute to higher levels of religiosity. 
Many people are emphasizing and organizing 
around different aspects of their identities, 
including race, gender, and sexual orientation, 
as well as around causes and issues, such 
as climate change and religious freedom. 
The forces of globalization, including greater 
mobility, urbanization, and connectivity, are in -
creasing awareness and prominence of a wide 
array of constituencies that transcend national 
boundaries and are making it easier for peo -
ple to organize around common interests and 
values. These identities are playing greater 
roles within and between countries as groups 
agitate for recognition and specific goals. For 
example, a broad global coalition has success -
fully lobbied for public acceptance of and legal 
protections for homosexuality worldwide, 
including organizing online campaigns and 
public events even in socially conservative 
countries, such as Iran. Between 2013 and 
2019, the percentage of people indicating that 
homosexuality should be accepted in society 
increased in 21 of 27 geographically diverse 
countries, according to the Pew Research Cen -
ter, and 30 countries have legalized same-sex 
marriage since 1989. . . . And in Conflict
The expansion and increasing prominence 
of identity groups demanding recognition 
and rights are forcing an increase in debate 
about the social and economic foundations of 
societies. Intensifying and competing identity 
dynamics are likely to provoke increasing polit -
ical debate and polarization, societal divisions, 
and in some cases, unrest and violence.
• Increasing numbers of immigrants, 
refugees, and guest workers in many 
countries, such as middle-income 
countries in Southeast and Central 
Europe, are prompting heated debates 
about national identity and citizenship 
and leading to the emergence of ethnic 
nationalist political parties, greater de -
mands for assimilationist policies, and a 
decline in support for migrants globally. 
• The growing recognition and support 
for LGBTQ rights are prompting re -
sponses from people in countries in ev -
ery region, such as Brazil, Iran, Nigeria, 
and Poland, where some people per -
ceive such movements as an affront to 
their deeply held beliefs and corrosive 
to their societies. Political and religious 
leaders in some countries are advocat -
ing laws restricting LGBTQ rights and 
criminalizing homosexuality. 
• In most countries, progress toward 
gender equality has been substantial, 
including improving education, health -
care, job opportunities, and leadership 
roles, but even in longstanding de -
mocracies, resentment and pushback 
remain. The global #MeToo movement 
shed light on the breadth of sexual 
harassment and sexual assault that 
occurs across the world, but still several 
countries, such as Hungary and Russia, have reduced protections for women, 
including decriminalizing domestic and 
sexual violence. 
INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT CONNECTING, 
CONFUSING, AND DIVIDING
The exponential growth of the hypercon -
nected information environment is likely to 
strengthen and further complicate identity 
allegiance and societal dynamics. Social media, 
in particular, makes it easier for people to af -
filiate with others around the world who share 
common characteristics, views, and beliefs. 
Moreover, social media can create echo cham -
bers of like-minded users who share informa -
tion that confirms their existing worldviews 
and limits their understanding of alternative 
perspectives.
Over time, this dynamic is increasing aware -
ness of and building new connections between 
previously isolated groups, while also polar -
izing people’s perceptions of policies, public 
institutions, events, moral issues, and societal 
trends. Such polarization will lead to a prolifer -
ation of competing, entrenched perspectives, 
limiting opportunities for compromise and 
decreasing societal cohesion. 
During the next 20 years, the algorithms and 
social media platforms that curate and distill 
massive amounts of data will produce content 
that could overtake expertise in shaping the 
political and social effects engendered by a 
hyperconnected information environment. 
Power increasingly will be wielded by the 
generators of content as well as the arbiters 
of who gets to see it. Social media platforms 
will reinforce identity groups, or foster new 
and unanticipated groupings, and accelerate 
and amplify natural tendencies to associate 
with people who share the same views, often 
engendering competing visions of the truth

GLOBAL TRENDS 204074about an issue. The platforms will make it eas -
ier for competing opinion leaders—including 
from marginalized groups—to publish their 
views and debate among themselves, honing 
the cohesiveness and “market appeal” of their 
messages. This effect is magnified because 
people rely on their own identity communities 
for information and piggyback on the knowl -
edge of others. 
People will also use social identities such as 
culture, ethnicity, nationality, and religion as 
critical filters for managing information over -
load, potentially further fragmenting national 
identities and undermining trust in govern -
ment. These identities provide a sense of be -
longing and reinforce norms about how group 
members should behave, rules about whom 
to trust, and beliefs about complex issues. 
Identity-based violence, including hate and po -
litical crimes, may increasingly be facilitated by 
social media. In India, social media and mobile 
messaging platforms have become a key force 
behind viral falsehoods, such as rumors that 
quickly spread among some Hindus regarding 
Muslims’ alleged slaughter of cows or posses -
sion of beef, which led to the “cow vigilante” 
lynching of Muslims. 
Publics increasingly will depend on their 
favorite gatekeepers—such as news media 
outlets, social media platforms, and trusted 
voices of authority—to sift truth from fiction. 
Efforts to arbitrate controversial content, such 
as flagging or removing demonstrably false 
claims, are unlikely to be effective in changing 
beliefs and values aligned with one’s closely 
held identities, however. Identity-based beliefs 
tend to eclipse truth-seeking because of the 
overriding need to belong, obtain status, 
understand the social world, maintain dignity, 
and feel morally justified.

GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
76NATIONAL IDENTITIES UNDER STRAIN 
In some countries, the contestation among 
identities is challenging conceptions of na -
tional identity, which historically have been a 
source of state cohesion and national pur -
pose. Nationalism overall has gained strength, 
but in some cases, exclusionary forms of 
nationalism are gaining prominence and 
weakening ideals of civic nationalism. Societies 
that are ethnically and culturally diverse may 
be more susceptible to challenge. Exclusionary 
forms of nationalism have been ascendant in 
many regions, especially those experiencing 
demographic changes, with slow or stagnant 
economic growth and people who fear losing 
special status. 
• Some leaders and regimes are fanning 
exclusionary nationalism to promote 
their rule and policies. In Burma, 
for example, the halting democratic 
transition during the past decade and 
countrywide poverty increased insecuri -
ties, which helped to intensify Buddhist 
nationalism and foster anti-Muslim 
sentiments and even violence. Like -
wise, Chinese leaders have tapped 
widespread, often xenophobic nation -
alism to build support for policies, such 
as an aggressive Chinese posture in 
territorial disputes. • In other cases, cultural and economic 
insecurity stemming from globaliza -
tion has fueled nationalist forces. For 
example, British supporters of Brexit 
cited a range of longstanding British 
complaints about the European Union, 
but most polling indicated that concern 
with migration was a key factor driving 
the Brexit vote. The migrant crisis in 
2015 also prompted a surge in nation -
alist forces in several other European 
countries, including France, Germany, 
and the Netherlands, where majority 
populations fear cultural change and 
economic competition. 
• Some government regimes seek to use 
religious and ethnic themes in other 
countries to mobilize foreign popular 
support for their foreign policy objec -
tives. India’s attempts to export Hindu 
nationalism, Turkey’s effort to mobi -
lize the Turkish diaspora in Europe to 
amplify Turkey’s influence, and Russia’s 
support of Russian Orthodox minori -
ties outside Russia demonstrate ways 
in which leaders exploit identities to 
achieve foreign policy goals.
PUBLICS MORE EMPOWERED, MORE DEMANDING
During the past few decades, steady economic 
improvements and access to technology have 
equipped populations in every region with 
the resources, time, and tools to channel their 
needs and interests into action and to engage 
officials and other elites with greater intensity, 
frequency, and effectiveness. Populations in 
advanced economies already are well posi -
tioned, and those in developing countries 
are becoming better equipped to agitate for 
change. For example, China’s middle class, de -
fined as those earning between $10 and $110 
per day, has grown rapidly from 3.1 percent Markus Spiske / Unsplash
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD77of the population in 2000 to 52.1 percent in 
2018—equivalent to approximately 686 million 
people who are better positioned to make 
demands on their government. 
• Publics in most of the world have 
grown more prosperous and educated 
during the past several decades, and 
the corresponding reduction in peo -
ple’s preoccupation with immediate 
needs has facilitated a wider scope of 
awareness and ambition. With greater 
prosperity, people will have more free 
time, higher expectations, and better 
access to the tools for participation, as 
well as increasing concerns about losing 
what they have achieved, which is likely 
to increase the intensity of political par -
ticipation during the next two decades. 
• Additionally, the growth in urban 
populations in the coming decades will 
be most pronounced in parts of the 
developing world that also struggle 
with the capacity to deliver services and 
are host to high percentages of young 
people, including Africa and South Asia. 
Urbanization is creating concentrated 
populations with shared interests and 
grievances—the raw ingredients fueling 
social movements that can quickly spiral 
into protests. 
• The proliferation of communication 
technologies is raising real-time aware -
ness of international trends and events 
on the ground and offering people 
the tools to organize and spread their messages. Between 2014 and 2020, 
the number of people worldwide using 
the Internet grew from 3 billion to 4.54 
billion. Mobile Internet penetration is 
projected to increase from 49 percent in 
2019 to 60.5 percent globally by 2025. 
An estimated 800 million more people 
will begin using social media platforms 
during the next five years, up from 3.6 
billion people in 2020. 
As people become better equipped and 
connected, the intensity of their demands on 
governments is likely to grow in every region. 
With higher expectations but more vulnerable 
conditions, people’s demands on governments 
for solutions to growing challenges could be -
come more varied, contradictory, and difficult 
to address. These demands are likely to range 
across economic, political, and social issues, 
with various groups pressing for conflicting 
policies—such as protecting key industries 
versus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Even in countries with strong democracies, 
people are likely to turn to mass protests, 
boycotts, civil disobedience, and even violence 
with increasing frequency, judging from the 
rise in public protests during the past decade. 
Along with social media, these also will be 
the preferred ways to make voices heard in 
authoritarian countries. During the next two 
decades, these multiple paths for channeling 
discontent are likely to present an increasing -
ly potent force with a mix of implications for 
social cohesion. Photo / Bigstock78STATE: TENSIONS, TURBULENCE,  
AND TRANSFORMATION
Key Takeaways
Governments in all regions will face mounting pressures from economic 
constraints and a mix of demographic, environmental, and other challenges. 
Meanwhile, populations will demand more, and they are empowered to push for 
their conflicting goals and priorities.
The relationships between societies and their governments are likely to face 
persistent tensions because of a growing mismatch between what publics 
expect and what governments deliver. This widening gap portends more 
political volatility, risks for democracy, and expanding roles for alternative sources 
of governance. 
Growing public discontent, if accompanied by a catalyzing crisis and inspired 
leadership, could spur significant shifts or transformations in how people govern.EMERGING DYNAMICSPhoto / BigstockPUBLIC

GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
80GROWING MISMATCH BETWEEN PUBLIC DEMANDS 
AND GOVERNMENT CAPABILITIES
Over the next two decades, the relationships 
between states and their societies in every 
region are likely to face persistent tensions 
because of a growing mismatch between what publics need or expect and what governments 
can or are willing to deliver. In many countries, 
populations with expectations heightened by previous prosperity are likely to face greater 
strains and disruptions from slowing eco -
nomic growth, uncertain job opportunities, and changing demographics. These popula -
tions also will be better equipped to advocate 
for their interests after decades of steady 
improvements in education and access to 
communication technologies as well as the greater coherence of like-minded groups. 
Although trust in government institutions is 
low among the mass public, people are likely to continue to view the state as ultimately 
responsible for addressing their challenges, 
and to demand more from their governments to deliver solutions. 
While populations are exercising more potent 
public voices, governments will experience 
mounting pressure from economic constraints and a mix of demographic, environmental, 
and other challenges. Individually and collec -tively, these pressures will test states’ capacity and resilience, deplete budgets, and add to 
the complexity of governing. 
Demographics and Human Development.  
Many countries will struggle to build on or 
even sustain the human development suc -
cesses achieved in the past several decades 
because of setbacks from the ongoing global 
pandemic, slower global economic growth, the effects of conflict and climate, and more 
difficult steps required to meet higher de -
velopment goals. Meanwhile, countries with 
aging populations and those with youthful and 
growing populations will each face unique sets 
of challenges associated with those demo -
graphics. Migration is likely to increase the 
salience of identity issues that divide societies 
in receiving countries and may fuel ethnic con -
flicts. Rapid urbanization—occurring mostly in 
Africa and Asia—will stress governments’ abili -
ty to provide adequate infrastructure, security, 
and resources for these growing cities. 
Responding to Climate Change and Environ -
mental Degradation  will strain governments 
in every region. The impact will be partic -
ularly acute in Africa, Asia, and the Middle 
East, where governments are already weak, stressed, or fragile. Wealthy countries will also 
increasingly face environmental costs and 
even disasters that challenge governments’ responsiveness and resources, potentially 
undermining public trust. 
Economic Constraints.  The expected trend 
of slowing economic growth is likely to strain 
the resources and capacity of governments 
to provide services. Governments are already 
saddled with debt on an unprecedented scale. In addition, rising or persistent inequality 
within many states, coupled with corruption, 
will threaten people’s faith in government and 
trust in one another.Alfarnas Solkar / Unsplash

in many countries will be a key challenge for governments and a source of discontent among populations.Photo / Bigstock
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD81Technological Change. Governments will be 
hard pressed to keep up with the pace of tech -
nological change and implement policies that 
harness the benefits and mitigate the risks 
and disruptions. Technological advances will 
also empower individuals and nonstate actors 
to challenge the role of the state in new way s.
In the face of these challenges, existing sys-
tems and models of go vernance are proving 
inadequate to meet the expectations of popu -
lations. The result is a growing disequilibrium 
between public demands and governments’ 
ability to deliver economic opportunity and 
security. This public pessimism cuts across 
rightwing, leftwing, and centrist governments, 
demo cratic and authoritarian states, and 
populist and technocratic administrations. For 
instance, in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
public opinion surveys in 18 countries showed 
a significant decline in satisfaction with how 
demo cracy is performing in their countries 
from an average of 59 percent of respondents 
in 2010 to 40 percent in 2018. As publics grow 
skeptical of existing go vernment systems, gov -
ernments and societies are likely to struggle 
to agree on how to adapt or transform to ad -
dress key goals, including advancing economic 
opportunities, addressing inequalities, and 
reducing crime and corruption. 
The nature of these challenges and the gov -
ernment responses will vary across regions 
and countries. In So uth Asia, for instanc e, 
some countries will face a combination of slo w 
economic growth that is likely to be insuffi -
cient to employ their expanding workforces, 
the effects of severe environmental degrada -
tion and climate change, and rising polariza -
tion. Meanwhile European countries are likely 
to contend with mounting debt, low produc -
tivity growth, aging and shrinking workforces, rural-urban divides, and possibly increasing 
inequality as well as fractured politics and debates over economic and fiscal policies at 
the national level and in the EU. In China, the central tension is whether the Chinese Com -
munist Party can maintain control by deliv -
ering a growing economy, public health, and 
safety, while repressing dissent. The massive 
middle class in China is largely quiescent now; an economic slowdown could change this.
Many states are likely to remain stuck in an 
uneasy disequilibrium in which populations 
are unsatisfied with the existing system but unable to reach consensus on a path for -
ward. A decade ago, the Arab Spring exposed serious shortcomings in the prevailing political orders, but in most countries in the region, a 
new social contract between state and soci -
ety has yet to emerge. Similar to the Middle 
East, other regions could be headed toward 
a protracted and tumultuous process in part 
because citizens have lost faith in the ability of government institutions to solve problems. Even if states impro ve security and welfare in 
the aggregate, these gains and opportunities 
may be unevenly distributed, fueling discon -
tent in seemingly more prosperous soc ieties. 
For instance, from 2000-2018, Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) countries experienced overall growth 
in employment, but jobs were divided be -
tween high and low wages with little in the 
middle, many jobs became increasingly tenu -
ous, and job growth varied significantly across 
regions and demographic groups. 
POLITICAL V OLATILITY RIS ING
In coming years, this mismatch between go v-
ernments’ abilities and publics’ expectations 
is likely to expand and lead to more political 
volatility, including growing polarizatio n and 
populism within po litical systems, waves of 
activism and protest movements, and, in the most extreme cases, violence, internal con-
flict, or even state collapse. Variations in state 
capacity, ideology, and prior histories with 
mobilization will shape how and when public discontent translates into political volatility in 
each country.
Polarization and Populism. Polarization 
along ethnic, religious, and ideological lines is 
likely to remain strong, as political leaders and 
well-organized groups push a wide variety of 
broad goals and approaches that cut across 
economic, governance, social, identity, and 
international issues. In some countries, such polarization is likely to increase and reinforce 
political dysfunction and gridlock and heighten 
risks of political instability. Once established, severe polarization is difficult to reverse. Pub -
lic dissatisfaction with mainstream politics for failing to address economic or social grievanc -
es has also led to the global rise in populism 
during the past several decades—measured in 
both the number of populist leaders in power and populist party vote shares worldwide. 
Although some populists will falter in office, 
the populist appeal is likely to endure as long as dissatisfaction, polarization, and fractured 
information landscapes persist. In addition, 
populism tends to surge after economic crises 
or changes in the ethnic or religious composi -
tion of a society from migration. 
Protests. Anti-government protests have 
increased globally since 2010, affecting every 
regime and government type. Although pro -
tests are a signal of political turbulence, they 
can also be a sign of democratic health and a 
force for democratization by pressing for ac -
countability and political change. The protest 
phenomenon is likely to persist in cycles and 
waves because of the enduring nature of the 
underlying drivers, including ongoing public dissatisfaction and desire for systemic change,

insufficient government responses, and perva -
sive technology to organize protests rapidly. 
Political Violence, Internal Conflict, and 
State Collapse. During the next two decades, 
increased volatility is likely to lead to the breakdown of political order and outbreak of 
political violence in numerous countries, par -
ticularly in the developing world. As of 2020, 
1.8 billion people—or 23 percent of the world’s 
population—lived in fragile contexts with weak 
governance, security, social, environmental, 
and economic conditions, according to an 
OECD estimate. This number is projected to grow to 2.2 billion—or 26 percent of the 
world’s population—by 2030. These states are 
mostly concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by the Middle East and North Africa, 
Asia, and Latin America. These areas will also 
face an increasing combination of conditions, including climate change, food insecurity, 
youthful and growing populations (in Africa), 
and rapid urbanization, that will exacerbate state fragility. Outbreaks of political violence 
or internal conflict are not limited to these 
fragile states, however, and are likely to ap -
pear even in historically more stable countries 
when political volatility grows severe. 
DEMOCRACY UNDER PRESSURE AND 
AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES ALSO VULNERABLE
This volatile political climate creates vulner -
abilities for all types of governments, from 
established liberal democracies to closed 
authoritarian systems. Adaptability and per -
formance are likely to be key factors in the 
relative rise and fall of democratic and author -
itarian governance during the next 20 years. 
Governments that harness new opportunities, 
adapt to rising pressures, manage growing 
social fragmentation, and deliver security and 
economic prosperity for their populations 
will preserve or strengthen their legitimacy, whereas those that fail will inspire competito rs 
or demands for alternative models. Demo cra-
cies will also have the advantage of drawing 
legitimacy from the fairness and inclusivity of 
their political systems—attributes harder to 
achieve in authoritarian systems. 
Democracy Eroding
The challenges go vernments face suggest 
there is a high risk that an ongoing trend in 
erosion of democratic governance will con -
tinue during at least the next decade and 
perhaps longer. This trend has been wide -
spread—seen in established, wealthy, liberal 
demo cracies as well as less mature partial 
demo cracies. Key democratic traits, including 
freedom of expressio n and the press, judicial 
independence, and pro tections for minori -
ties, are deteriorating globally with countries 
sliding in the direction of greater autho ritari -
anism. The democracy promo tion non-govern -
mental organization (NGO) Freedom House 
repo rted that 2020 was the 15th consecutive 
year of decline in political rights and civil liber-
ties. Another respected measure of democracy 
worldwide, Varieties of Democracy, indicates 
that as of 2020, 34 percent of the wo rld’s po p-
ulation were living in countries where dem-
ocratic governance was declining, compared 
with 4 percent who were living in countries 
that were becoming mo re democratic.
Several internal and external forces are driving 
this democratic erosion. In some Western 
demo cracies, public distrust of the capabil-
ities and policies of established parties and 
elites, as well as anxieties about economic 
dislocations, status reversals, and immigra-
tion, have fueled the rise of illiberal leaders 
who  are undermining democratic norms and 
institutions and civil liberties. In newer democ-
racies—mostly in the developing world—that 
transitioned from autho ritarian rule in the 
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD
831980s and 1990s, a mix of factors has led to 
democratic stagnation or backsliding, includ -
ing weak state capacity, tenuous rule of law, 
fragile traditions of tolerance for opposition, 
high inequality, corruption, and militaries 
with a strong role in politics. Externally, China, 
Russia and other actors, in varying ways, are 
undermining democracies and supporting 
illiberal regimes. This support includes sharing 
technology and expertise for digital repres -
sion. In particular, some foreign actors are 
attempting to undermine public trust in elec -
tions, threatening the viability of democratic 
systems. Both internal and external actors are 
increasingly manipulating digital information 
and spreading disinformation to shape public 
views and achieve political objectives. Looking forward, many democracies are likely 
to be vulnerable to further erosion and even 
collapse. An academic study of 75 democra -
cies that experienced substantial democratic 
decline since 1994 found that 60 of them (or 
80 percent) eventually became autocracies. 
However, the decline is not inexorable, and 
it may ultimately reflect a bad patch in a long 
cycle that has seen democracy advance and 
retreat, with an overarching trend to more 
democracy during the past century. The long-
term legitimacy of democratic systems hinges 
on two general conditions: maintaining a fair, 
inclusive, and equitable political process and 
delivering positive outcomes for populations. 
Addressing public concerns about corruption, 
elite capture, and inequality can help restore 
public trust and strengthen institutional legiti -

economic stability, and personal security—

creases public satisfaction. Beyond these basic 
governance benchmarks, demonstrating resil -
ience to emerging global challenges will help 
restore and maintain public confidence. 
Over the long term, the advance or retreat of 
democracy will depend in part on the rela -
tive power balance among major powers. 
Geopolitical competition, including efforts 
to influence or support political outcomes in 
other countries, relative success in delivering 
economic growth and public goods, and the 
extent of ideological contest between the 
Western democratic model and China’s tech -
no-authoritarian system, will shape democrat -
ic trends around the world. 
Authoritarian Regimes Will 
Face Vulnerabilities
Authoritarian regimes will face many of the 
same risks as democracies and many may 
be less adaptable, making a sudden, violent 
change of government after a period of ap -
parent stability more likely. Although authori -
tarian regimes in countries from China to the Middle East have demonstrated 
staying power, they have sig -
nificant structural weaknesses, 
including widespread corruption, 
overreliance on commodities, 
and highly personalist leader -
ship. Public protests are posing 
increasing threats to authoritari -
an regimes, toppling 10 regimes 
between 2010 and 2017; another 
19 regimes were removed in 
elections, often held in response 
to mass protests. Corruption 
was a primary motivation behind 
many protests, and authoritar -
ian regimes tend to be more corrupt than 
democracies. Authoritarian regimes that rely 
on raw commodities to finance their patron -
age networks and fuel their economies will 
be vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity 
prices, especially if energy transitions depress 
oil prices. Personalist authoritarian regimes—
in which power is consolidated in one person 
or a small group—tend to be the most corrupt 
and erratic in decisionmaking, the least likely 
to plan for succession, and the most likely to 
start wars and escalate conflicts. Today the 
most common form of authoritarian regime is 
personalist—rising from 23 percent of dicta -
torships in 1988 to 40 percent in 2016—and 
other regimes, including in China and Saudi 
Arabia, are moving in that direction. 
To try to quell, withstand, or address public 
discontent, authoritarian regimes are using 
new and traditional forms of coercion, coopta -
tion, and legitimation. Technology has helped 
make authoritarian regimes more durable in 
recent years, in part because digitization and 
communication technologies make surveil -
lance more pervasive and less costly. The flip 
side of these technological trends is that they

85have given populations the tools to circum -
vent digital repression and mobilize dissent. 
In addition to repression, regimes will rely on 
cooptation to convince critical allies to stay 
loyal, but this dynamic depends on more ten -
uous flows of resources. Many authoritarian 
governments will seek to build popular legit -
imacy through effective government perfor -
mance and compelling ideologies. With their 
centralized power, some authoritarian regimes 
have demonstrated faster and more flexible 
responses to emerging challenges, but histori -
cally authoritarian governments have suffered 
from lack of innovation caused by misalloca -
tion of resources. Authoritarian regimes that 
deliver economic opportunities and maintain 
security may convince their publics that their 
system is better suited to dealing with the 
complexity and speed of tomorrow’s world. 
ADAPTIVE APPROACHES TO GOVERNANCE: MORE 
ACTORS PROVIDING A WIDER RANGE OF SERVICES 
As public needs and expectations mount, 
there is likely to be a growing shift toward 
adaptive approaches to governance that 
involve a broader set of actors outside state 
institutions delivering welfare and security. 
Nonstate actors, including private sector com -
panies, NGOs, civil society groups, religious 
organizations, and insurgent and criminal 
networks, have long provided governance in 
all types of states. These roles are likely to ex -
pand to a wider range of actors and functions 
because of a combination of factors including: 
the failure of states to provide adequate gov -
ernance; the increasing resources and reach 
of the private sector, NGOs, and individuals 
because of technology; and the growing com -
plexity and number of public policy challenges 
that require multiple stakeholders to address. 
This shift is likely to produce some tensions and growing pains within states, as exempli -
fied by illiberal regimes cracking down on civil 
society organizations or democracies seeking 
to regulate social media and operations of 
some nonstate actors. 
Depending on the context and activity, non -
state actors will complement, compete with, 
and in some cases replace the state. The 
provision of governance outside state insti -
tutions does not necessarily pose a threat to 
central governments, nor does it diminish the 
overall quality of governance for the popu -
lation. The roles and relationships between 
state and nonstate actors will depend on their 
relative capacity, penetration, and alignment 
with population expectations. From the Middle 
East to Africa and Latin America, insurgent 
groups and criminal organizations are filling 
in the governance gap and at times exploiting 
weak governments to expand their influence 
by providing employment and social services, 
ranging from healthcare and education to 
security and trash collection. In other cases 
particularly in Africa, international NGOs, 
some religiously based, augment the role of 
the state by providing health and education 
services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
numerous examples of adaptive governance 
have appeared. Corporations, philanthropies, 
technology companies, and research and 
academic institutions have worked in concert 
with governments to produce breakthroughs 
at record speeds. Elsewhere, civil society or -
ganizations all over the world have filled gaps 
in government responses, providing humani -
tarian relief and welfare services. This role of 
nonstate actors in governance extends beyond 
providing services; for example, technology 
companies wield significant power in their 
control over information flows and networks 
with the ability to shape political discourse.

AmericaINNOVATION IN GOVERNANCE
States and nonstate actors will look for ways to adapt to 
mounting governance challenges, experimenting with novel 
tools and techniques for providing security and welfare that 
could in turn be adopted around the world. Although trends 
in governance innovation are diﬃcult to discern or forecast, 
one clear area of innovation will be in the development and 
application of technologies to improve the speed, eﬃciency, 
and precision of governance. 
• Governments worldwide have increased their use of 
technology for service provision and citizen engagement 
during the past two decades. While the most proﬁcient 
countries for digital governance are largely high-income 
countries, the general trend in digital governance extends 
across all countries and regions.  
• The increasing availability of data about all aspects of 
people’s lives—coupled with the artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) 
technology to analyze it—is making governments more agile 
in directing services and providing security. This is a 
double-edged sword: the same AI-enabled surveillance 
technology that allows governments to diminish crime also 
enables them to monitor and repress their populations. 
• Given the roles of public and private sectors in technology 
development and application, key innovations are likely to 
involve both state and nonstate actors. For instance, the 
advent of mobile payments and banking systems in Africa 
has allowed governments to implement cash transfers and 
pay employees more eﬃciently and reliably.  
• Once established, innovative governance approaches are 
likely to spread around the world. For example, AI-enabled 
surveillance technology has proliferated around the 
globe—adopted by at least 74 countries as of 2018—and is 
provided by both Chinese and Western companies. Likewise, 
successful models gain adherents quickly: at least 40 countries have implemented conditional cash transfer 
programs as a development tool, inspired in part by the 
success of Brazil’s Bolsa Familia program in the 2000’s in 
reducing poverty.  UN Online

GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
88Local Governance More 
Consequential
Local governments are also likely 
to become increasingly important 
sources of governance innovation 
because of their ability to solve 
problems for their populations. 
Local governments generally have 
the advantage of proximity to the 
problems of their constituents, 
legitimacy, accountability, and the 
flexibility to customize responses; 
they also have less partisanship. 
Cities and subnational govern -
ments have greater ability than national gov -
ernments to create and lead multisectoral net -
works involving various levels of government, 
private sector, and civil society; these partner -
ships have helped to revitalize some former 
industrial cities in the West. Local and city 
governments—increasingly organized into net -
works—will take action on international issues 
such as climate change and migration, getting 
ahead of national governments in some cases. 
As urban areas grow in population and as 
hubs for economic activity, technology, and 
innovation, these local governments are likely 
to gain increasing clout vis-a-vis national gov -
ernments. Even in authoritarian regimes, local governance is likely to be a locus for problem 
solving, but with different constraints.
Like national governments, local governments 
are likely to face budgetary constraints, par -
ticularly after the COVID-19 crisis. Cities in the 
developing world are likely to face significant 
financing gaps for infrastructure development 
and climate change adaptation. In addition, 
urbanization is likely to exacerbate urban-ru -
ral societal divides, while the expanding role 
for local and city governance may undermine 
policy coherence when local and national 
strategies for problem solving diverge.Image / Bigstock
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD89RIPE FOR NEW OR SHIFTING MODELS? 
The combination of widespread public discon -
tent and major crises or shocks could create 
conditions that are ripe for significant shifts 
or transformations in the models, ideologies, 
or ways of governing. Historically, ideologi -
cal shifts across regions have taken place at 
moments of catastrophic crisis, such as in the 
wake of a major war or economic collapse, 
because people are more willing to embrace 
bold systemic changes to address overarching 
problems. However, the emergence of a new 
unifying ideology or system—on the scale of 
communism or economic liberalism—is rare. 
Other stresses, such as another pandemic or 
a major environmental catastrophe, that ex -
pose governance shortcomings might create 
conditions ripe for new or alternative models 
to gain traction if widespread dysfunction 
is sustained. 
Pervasive discontent and major crises proba -
bly are necessary forcing functions for trans -
formations but not sufficient. Transforming 
discontent into something new also requires 
the combination of inspiring and unifying 
leadership with compelling ideas or ideology 
to build political coalitions and garner socie -tal consensus. Short of a new ideology, new 
approaches—or even more combinations or 
blends of systems—could occur along several 
axes, from centralized to localized governance, 
from a strong state role to a strong nonstate 
role, from democratic to authoritarian, from 
secular to religious, or from nationalist to in -
ternationalist. These shifts or transformations 
would spur inevitable contestation between 
the constituencies holding onto the old orders 
and those embracing the new ones. 
The precise nature of these shifts, transforma -
tions, or new models is uncertain and difficult 
to foresee. Some potential outcomes include: 
cities or subnational regions emerging as the 
focal point for governance if populations see 
local governments as more trustworthy and 
capable of solving problems than national 
governments; the private sector and other 
nonstate actors overtaking and displacing gov -
ernments as the primary providers of welfare 
and security; democracy experiencing a revival 
if it proves more adaptive to the coming global 
challenges; or the world succumbing to an 
authoritarian wave partially inspired by Chi -
na’s model of technology-driven authoritarian 
capitalism. Moreover, compelling new gover -
nance models or ideologies that have not yet 
been envisioned or identified could emerge 
and take hold. 
 Photo / Bigstock90INTERNATIONAL: MORE CONTESTED, 
UNCERTAIN, AND CONFLICT-PRONE
Key Takeaways
During the next two decades, power in the international system will evolve to 
include a broader set of sources and features with expanding technological, net -
work, and information power complementing more traditional military, econom -
ic, and cultural soft power. No single state is likely to be positioned to dominate 
across all regions or domains, opening the door for a broader range of actors to 
advance their interests. 
The United States and China will have the greatest influence on global dynamics, 
supporting competing visions of the international system and governance that 
reflect their core interests and ideologies. This rivalry will affect most domains, 
straining and in some cases reshaping existing alliances, international organiza -
tions, and the norms and rules that have underpinned the international order. 
In this more competitive global environment, the risk of interstate conflict is likely 
to rise because of advances in technology and an expanding range of targets, new 
frontiers for conflict and a greater variety of actors, more difficult deterrence, and a 
weakening or a lack of treaties and norms on acceptable use. EMERGING DYNAMICSPhoto / BigstockCHANGING

volatile and confrontational 
geopolitical environment, reshape 
multilateralism, and widen the gap 
between transnational challenges 
and cooperative arrangements to 
address them.
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
92During the next two decades, the intensity 
of competition for global influence is likely 
to reach its highest level since the Cold War. 
No single state is likely to be positioned to 
dominate across all regions or domains, and 
a broader range of actors will compete to 
advance their ideologies, goals, and inter -
ests. Expanding technological, network, and 
information power will complement more 
traditional military, economic, and soft power 
aspects in the international system. These 
power elements, which will be more accessi -
ble to a broader range of actors, are likely to 
be concentrated among leaders that develop 
these technologies. 
These power dynamics are likely to produce a 
more volatile and confrontational geopolitical 
environment, reshape multilateralism, and 
widen the gap between transnational chal -
lenges and cooperative arrangements to ad -
dress them. Rival powers will jockey to shape 
global norms, rules, and institutions. The Unit -
ed States, along with its longstanding allies, 
and China will have the greatest influence on 
global dynamics, supporting competing visions 
of the international system and governance 
that reflect their core interests and ideologies. 
Their rivalry will affect most domains, straining 
and in some cases reshaping existing alliances and international organizations that have un -
derpinned the international order for decades. 
Accelerating power shifts—as well as hard -
ening ideological differences and divisions 
over governance models—are likely to further 
ratchet up competition. The rivalry is unlikely 
to resemble the US-Soviet rivalry of the Cold 
War, however, because of the greater variety 
of actors in the international system that can 
shape outcomes, interdependence in various 
domains, and fewer exclusive ideological divid -
ing lines. The lack of a preponderant power 
or global consensus on some key areas will 
offer opportunities for other actors to lead or 
pursue their own interests, especially within 
their regions. The European Union (EU), India, 
Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom most 
likely will also be consequential in shaping 
geopolitical and economic outcomes. 
This more competitive environment with 
rapidly emerging technologies is likely to be 
more volatile with a heightened risk of conflict, 
at least until states establish new rules, norms, 
and boundaries for the more disruptive areas 
of competition. States will face a combination 
of highly destructive and precise conventional 
and strategic weapons, cyber activity targeting 
civilian and military infrastructure, and a con -
fusing disinformation environment. Regional 
actors, including spoilers such as Iran and 
North Korea, will jockey to advance their goals 
and interests, bringing more volatility and 
uncertainty to the system. At the same time, 
states may struggle to establish stable deter -
rence with these new systems, particularly if 
the rules and treaties governing them contin -
ue to erode or lag. 
CHANGING SOURCES AND  
COMPOSITION OF POWER 
During the next 20 years, sources of power in 
the international system are likely to expand Photo / Bigstock
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD93and redistribute. Material power, measured by 
the size of a nation’s economy, military, and 
population, and its technological development 
level, will provide the necessary foundation for 
exercising power, but will be insufficient for 
securing and maintaining favorable outcomes. 
In an even more hyperconnected world, pow -
er will include applying technology, human 
capital, information, and network position 
to modify and shape the behavior of other 
actors, including states, corporations, and 
populations. The attractiveness of a country’s 
entertainment, sports, tourism, and educa -
tional institutions will also remain important 
drivers of its influence. As global challenges 
such as extreme weather events and human -
itarian crises intensify, building domestic 
resiliency to shocks and systemic changes will 
become a more important element of national 
power, as will a state’s ability and willingness 
to help other countries. In coming years, the 
countries and nonstate actors that are best 
able to harness and integrate material capabil -
ities with relationships, network centrality, and 
resiliency will have the most meaningful and 
sustainable influence globally. 
Material Power.  Military capabilities and 
economic size will remain the foundation of 
state capacity and power projection, compel -
ling other countries to take a state’s interests 
and policies into account. These two areas of 
power allow states to maintain their security 
and to amass resources that enable other 
elements of power.
Technology Power.  Technology, particu -
larly military technologies, will continue to be central to a country’s security and global 
influence, but going forward, cutting edge 
artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, and 
data-driven decisionmaking will provide states 
with a range of advantages for econom -
ic growth, manufacturing, healthcare, and 
societal resiliency. With these technologies, 
there will be a first mover advantage, enabling 
states and nonstate actors to shape the views 
and decisionmaking of populations, to gain 
information advantages over competitors, and 
to better prepare for future shocks. 
Human Capital.  Favorable demographics, 
including a strong working-age population, 
universal basic education, and a concentra -
tion of science, engineering, math, and critical 
thinking skills, will provide large advantages 
for innovation, technological advancement, 
economic growth, and resiliency. Regions 
with large working-age populations, including 
in Latin America and South Asia, will have 
new sources of potential economic strength 
if they can improve education, skillsets, and 
infrastructure; aging and contracting societies 
in Europe and Asia will need to find ways to 
augment their workforce to avoid seeing this 
element of power weakened. 
Networks and Nodes . Control of key sites 
of exchange, including telecommunications, 
finance, data flows, and manufacturing supply 
chains, will give countries and corporations 
the ability to gain valuable information, deny 
access to rivals, and even coerce behavior. 
Many of these networks, which are dispropor -
tionately concentrated in the United States, 
Europe, and China, have become entrenched Photos / Bigstock
GLOBAL TRENDS 204094over decades and probably will be difficult to 
reconfigure. If China’s technology companies 
become co-dominant with US or European 
counterparts in some regions or dominate 
global 5G telecommunications networks, for 
example, Beijing could exploit its privileged 
position to access communications or con -
trol data flows. Exercising this form of power 
coercively, however, risks triggering a backlash 
from other countries, and could diminish the 
effectiveness over time. 
Information and Influence.  Compelling ideas 
and narratives can shape the attitudes and 
priorities of other actors in the international 
system, and they can legitimize the exercise of 
other types of power. The soft power attrac -
tiveness of a society, including its culture, 
entertainment exports, sports, lifestyles, and 
technology innovations, can also capture the 
imagination of other populations. Tourism and 
education abroad—particularly higher educa -
tion—can increase the attractiveness. From 
public diplomacy and media to more covert 
influence operations, information technolo -
gies will give governments and other actors 
unprecedented abilities to reach directly to 
foreign publics and elites to influence opinions 
and policies. China and Russia probably will try 
to continue targeting domestic audiences in 
the United States and Europe, promoting nar -
ratives about Western decline and overreach. 
They also are likely to expand in other regions, 
for example Africa, where both have already 
been active. 
Resiliency.  As the world has become more 
deeply interconnected, systemic shocks are 
becoming more common and more intense, 
spawning many second-order effects. Govern -
ments that are able to withstand, manage, and 
recover from shocks and that have domestic 
legitimacy will have better capacity to project power and influence abroad. Building resilien -
cy, however, depends on a reservoir of trust 
within societies and between populations and 
leaders, and is likely to be more difficult to 
muster as societies become more fractured.
MORE ACTORS ASSERTING AGENCY
As sources of power expand and shift globally, 
the actors and the roles they play in shaping 
global dynamics will also change. No single 
actor will be positioned to dominate across all 
regions and in all domains, offering opportuni -
ties for a broader array of actors and increas -
ing competition across all issues. The growing 
contest between China and the United States 
and its close allies is likely to have the broad -
est and deepest impact on global dynamics, in -
cluding global trade and information flows, the 
pace and direction of technological change, 
the likelihood and outcome of interstate con -
flicts, and environmental sustainability. Even 
under the most modest estimates, Beijing is 
poised to continue to make military, economic, 
and technological advancements that shift the 
geopolitical balance, particularly in Asia. 
China Reclaiming Global Power Role
In the next two decades, China almost certain -
ly will look to assert dominance in Asia and 
greater influence globally, while trying to avoid 
what it views as excessive liabilities in strategi -
cally marginal regions. In Asia, China expects 
deference from neighbors on trade, resource 
exploitation, and territorial disputes. China is 
likely to field military capabilities that put US 
and allied forces in the region at heightened 
risk and to press US allies and partners to 
restrict US basing access. Beijing probably will 
tout the benefits of engagement while warning 
of severe consequences of defiance. China’s 
leaders almost certainly expect Taiwan to 
move closer to reunification by 2040, possibly 
through sustained and intensive coercion. Photos / Bigstock
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD95China will work to solidify its own physical 
infrastructure networks, software platforms, 
and trade rules, sharpening the global lines of 
techno-economic competition and potentially 
creating more balkanized systems in some 
regions. China is likely to use its infrastructure 
and technology-led development programs 
to tie countries closer and ensure elites align 
with its interests. China probably will continue 
to seek to strengthen economic integration 
with partners in the Middle East and Indian 
Ocean region, expand its economic penetra -
tion in Central Asia and the Arctic, and work 
to prevent countervailing coalitions from 
emerging. China is looking to expand exports 
of sophisticated domestic surveillance tech -
nologies to shore up friendly governments 
and create commercial and data-generating 
opportunities as well as leverage with client 
regimes. China is likely to use its technological 
advancements to field a formidable military 
in East Asia and other regions but prefers 
tailored deployments—mostly in the form of 
naval bases—rather than large troop deploy -
ments. At the same time, Beijing probably will 
seek to retain some important linkages to US 
and Western-led networks, especially in areas 
of greater interdependence such as finance 
and manufacturing. 
China is likely to play a greater role in leading 
responses to confronting global challenges 
commensurate with its increasing power and 
influence, but Beijing will also expect to have 
a greater say in prioritizing and shaping those 
responses in line with its interests. China 
probably will look to other countries to offset 
the costs of tackling transnational challenges 
in part because Beijing faces growing domestic 
problems that will compete for attention and 
resources. Potential financial crises, a rapidly 
aging workforce, slowing productivity growth, environmental pressures, and rising labor 
costs could challenge the Chinese Communist 
Party and undercut its ability to achieve its 
goals. China’s aggressive diplomacy and hu -
man rights violations, including suppression of 
Muslim and Christian communities, could limit 
its influence, particularly its soft power. 
Other Major Powers 
Other major powers, including Russia, the EU, 
Japan, the United Kingdom, and potentially In -
dia, could have more maneuvering room to ex -
ercise influence during the next two decades, 
and they are likely to be consequential in 
shaping geopolitical and economic outcomes 
as well as evolving norms and rules.
Russia  is likely to remain a disruptive power 
for much or all of the next two decades even 
as its material capabilities decline relative 
to other major players. Russia’s advantages, 
including a sizeable conventional military, 
weapons of mass destruction, energy and min -
eral resources, an expansive geography, and a 
willingness to use force overseas, will enable 
it to continue playing the role of spoiler and 
power broker in the post-Soviet space, and at 
times farther afield. Moscow most likely will 
continue trying to amplify divisions in the West 
and to build relationships in Africa, across the 
Middle East, and elsewhere. Russia probably 
will look for economic opportunity and to es -
tablish a dominant military position in the Arc -
tic as more countries step up their presence in 
the region. However, with a poor investment 
climate, high reliance on commodities with 
potentially volatile prices, and a small econo -
my—projected to be approximately 2 percent 
of global gross domestic product (GDP) for 
the next two decades—Russia may struggle to 
project and maintain influence globally. Pres -
ident Vladimir Putin’s departure from power, 
either at the end of his current term in 2024 or later, could more quickly erode Russia’s 
geopolitical position, especially if internal 
instability ensues. Similarly, a decrease in 
Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, either 
through renewables or diversifying to other 
gas suppliers, would undercut the Kremlin’s 
revenue generation and overall capacity, es -
pecially if those decreases could not be offset 
with exports to customers in Asia. 
The EU’s  large market and longstanding lead -
ership on international norms will enable it to 
retain significant influence in coming decades, 
especially if it can prevent additional mem -
bers from departing and can reach consensus 
on a common strategy for navigating global 
competition and transnational challenges. The 
economic weight of the EU’s single market 
almost certainly will continue to give it global 
geopolitical clout on trade, sanctions, tech -
nology regulations, and environmental and 
investment policies. Countries outside the EU 
often model their standards and regulations 
on EU policies. European military strength 
is likely to fall short of some members’ am -
bitions because of competing priorities and 
long-term underinvestment in key capabilities. 
European defense expenditures will compete 
with other post–COVID-19 fiscal priorities, and 
its security initiatives are unlikely to produce 
a military capability separate from the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization that can defend 
against Russia. 
The United Kingdom  is likely to continue to 
punch above its weight internationally given 
its strong military and financial sector and its 
global focus. The United Kingdom’s nuclear ca -
pabilities and permanent UN Security Council 
membership add to its global influence. Man -
aging the economic and political challenges 
posed by its departure from the EU will be the country’s key challenge; failure could lead to a 
splintering of the United Kingdom and leave it 
struggling to maintain its global power. 
Japan’s  highly educated population, techno -
logically innovative economy, and integral 
position in trade and supply chain networks 
position it to remain a strong power in Asia 
and beyond. Japan is likely to remain highly 
economically dependent on its largest trading 
partner and main regional rival China and a 
close ally of the United States while working 
to further diversify security and economic 
relationships, particularly with Australia, India, 
Taiwan, and Vietnam. Japan will also face 
mounting demographic and macroeconomic 
challenges, including a shrinking labor force—
the oldest of any developed country—with in -
flexible immigration policies, low demand and 
economic growth, deflation, declining savings 
rates, and increased government debt. 
India’s  population size—projected to become 
the largest in the world by 2027—geography, 
strategic arsenal, and economic and techno -
logical potential position it as a potential glob -
al power, but it remains to be seen whether 
New Delhi will achieve domestic development 
goals to allow it to project influence beyond 
South Asia. As China and the United States 
compete, India is likely to try to carve out a 
more independent role. However, India may 
struggle to balance its long-term commit -
ment to strategic autonomy from Western 
powers with the need to embed itself more 
deeply into multilateral security architectures 
to counter a rising China. India faces serious 
governance, societal, environmental, and 
defense challenges that constrain how much 
it can invest in the military and diplomatic 
capabilities needed for a more assertive global 
foreign policy.
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040
96Regional Powers Seeking 
Greater Influence 
In this competitive environment, regional pow -
ers, such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Iran, 
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United 
Arab Emirates (UAE), probably will seek to take 
advantage of new opportunities and to take 
on roles previously filled by a major power to 
shore up regional stability or gain influence. 
This mix of regional powers seeking greater 
roles and influence is likely to change during 
the next two decades, reflecting opportunities 
as well as the changing capabilities and leader -
ship goals of various states. Regional powers 
probably will try to play major powers off each 
other to maximize rewards while attempting 
to avoid being drawn into unwanted conflicts. 
They may seek to build their own coalitions 
or strengthen regional blocs to project influ -
ence and in some cases, collaborate on global 
challenges, but in other cases they may act 
more aggressively in conflicts in their region. 
Overcoming domestic governance challeng -
es, recovering quickly from the COVID-19 
pandemic and other shocks, and managing 
relationships with neighbors will be crucial for 
converting their key strengths into increased 
influence. Some probably will play crucial roles 
in tackling challenges at the regional level 
including nonstate actor security threats, ter -
rorism, mass migration, and digital privacy. 
Nonstate Actors Powerful, Influential 
Nonstate actors, such as NGOs, religious 
groups, and technology superstar firms, will 
have the resources and global reach to build 
and promote alternative networks that com -
plement, compete with, or possibly bypass 
states. In the past several decades, nonstate 
actors and transnational movements have 
used growing international connections for 
collective action or to influence populations 
around the world. In some cases, these actors can shape or constrain state actions through 
lobbying leaders and mobilizing citizens. The 
influence of nonstate actors will vary and be 
subject to government intervention. China, the 
EU, and others are already moving to regu -
late or break up superstar firms, while Beijing 
is trying to control or suppress NGOs and 
religious organizations. Many nonstate actors 
are likely to try to push back on state efforts 
to consolidate sovereignty in newer frontiers, 
including cyberspace and space. GEOPOLITICAL COMPETITION INTENSIFYING  
AI-POWERED PROPAGANDA
The growth in global digital connectivity, immersive information 
technology, and widely accessible digital marketing techniques 
opens the potential for greater information influence activities 
against almost all societies. 
Both states and nonstate actors almost certainly will be able to 
use these tools to influence populations, including by ratch -
eting up cognitive manipulation and societal polarization to 
shape how people receive, interpret, and act on information. 
Countries, including China and Russia, are likely to apply 
technological innovations to make their information campaigns 
more agile, difficult to detect, and harder to combat, as they 
work to gain greater control over media content and means 
of dissemination. 
Governments and nonstate actors are increasingly able to 
exploit consumer behavior data and marketing techniques to 
microtarget messages to small audience segments. Propagan -
dists could leverage AI, the Internet of Things, and other tools 
to tailor communications to large audiences, anticipate their 
reactions, and adapt messaging in near real time. 
Behavioral big data, which captures statistical patterns in 
human psychology and action, may also enable significant 
predictive power and capacity for personalized influence. If 
meaningful regulation does not exist, public relations firms 
and political consultants can offer disinformation as a regular 
service, increasing public distrust in political institutions.
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD
97GLOBAL TRENDS 204098CONTESTED AND TRANSFORMING  
INTERNATIONAL ORDER
As global power continues to shift, many of 
the relationships, institutions, and norms that 
have largely governed and guided behavior 
across issues since the end of the Cold War 
are likely to face increasing challenges. Com -
petition in these areas has been on the rise for 
years with China, Russia, and other countries 
demanding a greater say. Disagreements are 
likely to intensify over the mission and conduct 
of these institutions and alliances, raising un -
certainty about how well-equipped they will be 
to respond to traditional and emerging issues. 
Over time, states may even abandon some 
aspects of this international order.
Rising and revisionist powers, led by China and 
Russia, are seeking to reshape the internation -
al order to be more reflective of their interests 
and tolerant of their governing systems. China 
and Russia continue to advocate for an order 
devoid of Western-origin norms that allows 
them to act with impunity at home and in 
their perceived spheres of influence. They are 
advocating for alternative visions of the role of 
the state and human rights and are seeking to 
roll back Western influence, but their alter -
native models differ significantly from each 
other. Russia is promoting traditional values 
and desires a Russian-dominated protectorate 
covering much of Eurasia. China seeks growing 
global acceptance of its current social sys -
tem—namely the Chinese Communist Party’s 
monopoly on power and control over society—
socialist market economy, and preferential 
trading system. 
Increasing Ideological Competition
The multidimensional rivalry with its contrast -
ing governing systems has the potential to add 
ideological dimensions to the power struggle. Although the evolving geopolitical competi -
tion is unlikely to exhibit the same ideological 
intensity as the Cold War, China’s leadership 
already perceives it is engaged in a long-term 
ideological struggle with the United States. 
Ideological contests most often play out in 
international organizations, standard-setting 
forums, regional development initiatives, and 
public diplomacy narratives. 
Western democratic governments probably 
will contend with more assertive challenges to 
the Western-led political order from China and 
Russia. Neither has felt secure in an interna -
tional order designed for and dominated by 
democratic powers, and they have promoted 
a sovereignty-based international order that 
protects their absolute authority within their 
borders and geographic areas of influence. 
China and Russia view the ideas and ideology 
space as opportunities to shape the compe -
tition without the need to use military force. 
Russia aims to engender cynicism among 
foreign audiences, diminish trust in institu -
tions, promote conspiracy theories, and drive 
wedges in societies. As countries and nonstate 
actors jockey for ideological and narrative su -
premacy, control over digital communications 
platforms and other vehicles for dissemination 
of information will become more critical. 
Relationships Facing More Tradeoffs 
In this more competitive geopolitical environ -
ment, many countries would prefer to main -
tain diverse relationships, particularly econom -
ic ties, but over time, actions by China, Russia, 
and others may present starker choices over 
political, economic, and security priorities and 
relationships. Some countries may gravitate 
toward looser, more ad hoc arrangements and 
partnerships that provide greater flexibility 
to balance security concerns with trade and A MORE CONTESTED WORLD99economic interests. Longstanding security 
alliances in Europe and Asia are facing growing 
strains from a confluence of domestic per -
ceptions of security threats, concerns about 
partner reliability, and economic coercion. 
That said, if China and Russia continue to 
ratchet up pressure, their actions may re-solid -
ify or spawn new security relationships among 
democratic and like-minded allies, enabling 
them to put aside differences.
China and Russia probably will continue to 
shun formal alliances with each other and 
most other countries in favor of transac -
tional relationships that allow them to exert 
influence and selectively employ economic 
and military coercion while avoiding mutual 
security entanglements. China and Russia are 
likely to remain strongly aligned as long as Xi 
and Putin remain in power, but disagreements 
over the Arctic and parts of Central Asia may 
increase friction as power disparities widen in 
coming years. 
Contestation Weakening Institutions 
Many of the global intergovernmental orga -
nizations that have underpinned the West -
ern-led international order for decades, 
including the UN, World Bank, and World 
Trade Organization (WTO), are bogged down 
by political deadlock, decreasing capacity 
relative to worsening transnational challenges, 
and increasing country preferences for ad hoc 
coalitions and regional organizations. Most of 
these organizations are likely to remain diplo -
matic battlegrounds and to become hollowed 
out or sidelined by rival powers. 
Looking forward, these global institutions are 
likely to continue to lack the capacity, mem -
ber buy-in, and resources to help effectively 
manage transnational challenges, including climate change, migration, and economic 
crises. In many cases, these challenges exceed 
the institutions’ original mandates. Mem -
bers’ rising fiscal challenges could translate 
into diminished contributions, and sclerotic 
decisionmaking structures and entrenched 
interests will limit the ability to reform and 
adapt institutions. These institutions probably 
will work with and in some cases in parallel 
with regional initiatives and other governance 
arrangements, such as the epidemic response 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, infrastructure financ -
ing in Asia, and artificial intelligence (AI) and 
biotechnology governance. The future focus 
and effectiveness of established international 
organizations depend on the political will of 
members to reform and resource the institu -
tions and on the extent to which established 
powers accommodate rising powers, particu -
larly China and India. The WTO probably will 
face considerable uncertainty about its future 
role and capacity to foster greater coopera -
tion and open trade as states become more 
protectionist and rival blocs square off against 
each other. In contrast, the unique role of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and high 
demand for IMF conditionality and assistance 
in debt restructuring most likely will make it 
central to the international system, although 
the growth of sovereign debt outside IMF 
purview will be a challenge. Similarly, mul -
tistakeholder agreements and organizations 
that regulate the global financial, insurance, or 
technical systems such as the Basel Accords 
and Internet Engineering Task Force are likely 
to remain in high demand. 
Western leadership of the intergovernmental 
organizations may further decline as China 
and Russia obstruct Western-led initiatives 
and press their own goals. China is working to GLOBAL TRENDS 2040100re-mold existing international institutions to 
reflect its development and digital governance 
goals and mitigate criticism on human rights 
and infrastructure lending while simultane -
ously building its own alternative arrange -
ments to push development, infrastructure 
finance, and regional integration, including 
the Belt and Road Initiative, New Development 
Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, 
and the Regional Comprehensive Economic 
Partnership. In the past five years, Moscow 
has tried to undermine international efforts to 
strengthen safeguards and monitor for chem -
ical weapons and has used the International 
Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) to 
pursue opponents.
Continued underperformance of many of the 
global multilateral institutions is likely to shift 
some focus to alternative informal, multi-ac -
tor arrangements, such as the G5 Sahel Joint 
Force to counter extremists in the Sahel, the 
global vaccine alliance, and the global initiative 
to bring greater transparency to extractive 
industries. Some of these show promise in 
filling crucial capacity gaps, but their long-term 
impact will depend on marshalling the re -
sources, political buy-in, and leadership from 
major and regional powers. Some regions, 
particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and 
Southeast Asia, are likely to continue moves 
to strengthen regional organizations and 
integration, whereas other regions are likely 
to struggle to cooperate because of lingering 
inter-state divisions.
Standards as a Battlespace
International standards agreements sup -
port the emergence of new technologies by 
reducing market uncertainty and establish -
ing norms. Membership on standard-setting 
bodies is increasingly competitive, largely 
because of the influence these bodies have on how and which technologies enter the market, 
and thereby, which technology producers gain 
advantage. Long dominated by the United 
States and its allies, China is now moving 
aggressively to play a bigger role in establish -
ing standards on technologies that are likely 
to define the next decade and beyond. For 
example, international standard-setting bod -
ies will play critical roles in determining future 
ethical standards in biotechnology research 
and applications, the interface standards for 
global communication, and the standards for 
intellectual property control. 
Competition Over Global Norms 
A broad set of actors will increasingly compete 
to promote and shape widely shared global 
norms ranging from respect for human rights 
and democratic institutions to conduct in war -
fare. Some democracies that experienced pop -
ulist backlashes have backed away from their 
longstanding roles as champions of norms 
protecting civil liberties and individual rights. 
At the same time, authoritarian powers, led by 
China and Russia, have gained traction as they 
continue to emphasize their values and push 
back on norms they view as Western-centric—
particularly those that gained currency after 
the end of the Cold War, such as exceptions 
that allow for interfering in the internal affairs 
of member states to defend human rights. 
During the next 20 years, this competition 
probably will make it harder to maintain com -
mitment to many established norms and to 
develop new ones to govern behavior in new 
domains, including cyber, space, sea beds, 
and the Arctic. Existing institutions and norms 
are not well designed for evolving areas such 
as biotechnology, cyber, and environmental 
response and for the growing number of new 
actors operating in space. Many norm-setting 
efforts may shift from consensus-based, uni -OUTLOOK FOR INTERNATIONAL NORMS

growing risks of unilateral action or if increas -
ingly powerful nonstate actors throw their 
weight behind new guidelines, particularly 
regarding the use of emerging technologies. 
INCREASING RISK OF INTERSTATE CONFLICT 
In this more competitive global environment, 
the risk of interstate conflict is likely to rise 
because of advances in technology and an ex -
panding range of targets, a greater variety of 
actors, more difficult dynamics of deterrence, 
and weakening or gaps in treaties and norms 
on acceptable use. Major power militaries are 
likely to seek to avoid high-intensity conflict 
and particularly full-scale war because of the 
prohibitive cost in resources and lives, but 
the risk of such conflicts breaking out through 
miscalculation or unwillingness to compro -
mise on core issues is likely to increase. 
Changing Character of Conflict
Rapidly advancing technologies, including 
hypersonics and AI, are creating new or 
enhanced types of weapons systems while of -
fering a wider array of potential targets, across 
military and civilian capabilities and including 
domestic infrastructure, financial systems, 
cyber, and computer networks. These technol -
ogies will give states a broader spectrum of 
coercive tools that fall below the level of kinet -
ic attacks, which many states may be likely to 
favor as a means of achieving strategic effects 
while avoiding the political, economic, and 
human costs of direct violence and declaring 
hostilities. The result may be further muddied 
distinctions between sharpened competition 
and conflict, increasing the motivations for states to establish supremacy at each level of 
the escalation ladder. 
Better sensors, automation, AI, hypersonic 
capabilities, and other advanced technologies 
will produce weapons with greater accuracy, 
speed, range, and destructive power, changing 
the character of conflict during the next 20 
years. Although advanced militaries will have 
greater access to these advanced capabilities, 
some weapons are likely to come within reach 
of smaller states and nonstate actors. The 
proliferation and diffusion of these systems 
over time are likely to make more civilian and 
military systems vulnerable, heighten the risk 
of escalation, potentially weaken deterrence, 
and make combat potentially more deadly, 
although not necessarily more decisive. In a 
prolonged, large-scale conflict between major 
powers, some advanced military technologies 
may begin to have a diminishing impact on the 
battlefield as expensive and difficult to quickly 
replace high-end systems are damaged or de -
stroyed or, in the case of munitions, expended 
in combat. Advanced sensors and weapons 
will aid in counterinsurgency efforts to identify 
and target insurgent forces, but these sys -
tems may not be sufficient to achieve decisive 
results given the already asymmetric nature of 
such conflicts.
Dominance in major power competition 
and more specifically on the battlefield may 
increasingly depend on harnessing and pro -
tecting information and connecting military 
forces. Belligerents are increasingly likely to 
target their adversaries’ computer networks, 
critical infrastructure, electromagnetic spec -
trum, financial systems, and assets in space, 
threatening communications and undermining 
warning functions. The number and quality of 
sensors for observation will increase, as will MAJOR POWER COMPETITION INCREASING THE

103the challenges for making sense of and using 
information. Some governments will be able 
to manipulate information against their rivals 
with more precision at scale. 
Increasing sensors and connectivity will also 
make militaries and governments more 
vulnerable to cyber and electromagnetic 
attacks. The development of cyber weapons, 
doctrine, and procedures in conjunction with 
other weapons is likely to mature significant -
ly during the next 20 years, increasing the 
consequences of cyber conflict. Countries that 
can disperse their networks and important 
warfighting assets, shorten decisionmaking 
processes, and build in redundancy at every 
level are likely to be better positioned for 
future conflicts. 
Interstate kinetic conflicts—defined as direct 
engagement between the military forces of 
two or more adversaries in which at least one participant suffers substantial casualties 
or damage—are likely to escalate faster and 
with less warning than before, compressing 
response times and increasing pressure to 
delegate or even automate certain decision -
making. Inexpensive sensors and data analyt -
ics could revolutionize real-time detection and 
processing by 2040, but many militaries most 
likely will still struggle to distill meanings and 
compile options for policymakers without AI 
and other algorithmic decisionmaking aids. 
This increased speed is likely to heighten the 
risk of miscalculation or inadvertent escalation 
to full-scale war. 
Additional Players 
Some state-to-state conflicts and internation -
al interventions in local conflicts are likely to 
involve more armed proxies, private military 
companies, hackers, and terrorist organiza -

104INTRASTATE VERSUS INTERSTATE CONFLICT TRENDS 
NUMBER OF CONFLICTS, 1946-2019After several decades of low frequency of interstate conﬂict, internal conﬂicts and civil wars 
increasingly are taking on international dimensions, as regional and international powers back 
diﬀerent sides and directly contribute troops and materiel. These conﬂicts could begin to spill 
over into more direct, major power conﬂict, especially as combatants employ new technologies 
or techniques. This graphic separates intrastate conﬂicts, in which there is no interference from 
other countries, from internationalized intrastate conﬂicts—in which at least one side receives 
direct support from other governments that actively participate in the conﬂict.

costs for conducting attacks. Proxies and pri -
vate companies can reduce the cost of train -
ing, equipping, and retaining specialized units 
and provide manpower for countries with 
declining populations. Some groups can more 
quickly achieve objectives with smaller foot -
prints and asymmetric techniques. Russia and 
Turkey have used private and proxy groups in 
conflicts in Libya and Syria, and private firms 
have provided a wide range of logistical and 
other services for coalition forces in Afghani -
stan, Iraq, and other countries. 
More Difficult Deterrence
The introduction of non-kinetic and non-tra -
ditional weapons, new frontiers, and more 
players is likely to complicate deterrence 
paradigms and blur escalation red lines. 
Deterrence strategies rely on the prospect of 
harm to persuade an opponent to not engage in a specified behavior. These strategies have 
always been difficult to sustain outside of nu -
clear warfare, and new forms of attack—cyber 
and information operations, for example—
will add to the challenge. Compounding the 
challenge, many countries lack clear doctrines 
for new military capabilities—including con -
ventional, weapons of mass destruction, and 
asymmetric—to guide their use and develop 
shared understandings for deterrence. Ad -
vancements in conventional and hypersonic 
weapons; ballistic missile defense; robotics 
and automated systems; intelligence, surveil -
lance, and reconnaissance networks; and long-
range antiship missiles almost certainly will 
further complicate deterrence calculations and 
could lead to asymmetric retaliation. Leaders 
might calculate that they need to strike first in 
a crisis to avoid losing advanced weapons to a 
surprise attack. 
A MORE CONTESTED WORLD
105Arms Control and Treaties on the Brink 
Existing norms and treaties governing the 
use of arms and conduct of war are increas -
ingly contested, and new understandings are 
lagging behind technological innovations. 
Repeated and unpunished violations of rules 
and norms on nonviolability of borders, assas -
sination, and use of certain prohibited weap -
ons, like chemical weapons, are shifting actors’ 
cost-benefit analysis in favor of their use. 
Renewed competition, accusations of cheating, 
and the suspension or non-renewal of several 
major agreements are likely to weaken stra -
tegic arms control structures and undermine 
nonproliferation. 
Reaching agreement on new treaties and 
norms for certain weapons most likely will be 
more difficult for these reasons and because 
of the increasing number of actors possessing 
these weapons. Weapons considered to have 
strategic impact probably will no longer be 
confined to nuclear weapons as conventional 
weapon capabilities improve and new capa -
bilities, such as long-range precision strike 
that could put at risk national leadership, offer 
powerful effects. Countries may struggle to 
reach agreement on limiting the disruptive or 
security aspects of AI and other technology 
because of definitional differences, dual-use 
commercial applications, and reliance on 
commercial and often international entities to 
develop new systems. Incentives for such rules 
and enforcement mechanisms could emerge 
over time, especially if crises unfold that show -
case the big risks and costs of unrestrained 
arms development.GROWING CHANCE OF NUCLEAR 
PROLIFERATION OR EVEN  
NUCLEAR USE
Nuclear proliferation and potentially nuclear use are 
more likely in this competitive geopolitical environ -
ment. Advances in technology and diversification of de -
livery systems, arms control uncertainties, and spread 
of knowledge and skills related to nuclear technology 
add to the higher risk. 
Countries that have declared their nuclear weapons 
are adding to or upgrading their arsenals; China and 
Russia are investing in new delivery vehicles includ -
ing missiles, submarines, bombers, and hypersonic 
weapons. These states are likely to continue to field 
increasingly accurate, lower yield nuclear weapons on 
platforms intended for battlefield use, which could en -
courage states to consider nuclear use in more instanc -
es with doctrines that differentiate between large-scale 
nuclear exchanges and “limited use” scenarios. 
Perceived external security threats are increasing in 
many regions, particularly the Middle East and Asia, 
which is a key factor in states’ decision to develop 
nuclear weapons, according to academic research. 
Growing questions about security guarantees, extend -
ed deterrence, and heightened regional pressures 
could lead some advanced economies to acquire or 
build their own programs. 
GLOBAL TRENDS 2040

A MORE CONTESTED WORLD107THE FUTURE OF TERRORISM:  
DIVERSE ACTORS, FRAYING INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS
Terrorist groups will continue to exploit societal fragmen -
tation and weak governance to push their ideologies and 
gain power through violence. During the next 20 years, 
regional and intrastate conflicts, demographic pressures, 
environmental degradation, and democratic retrenchment 
are likely to exacerbate the political, economic, and social 
grievances terrorists have long exploited to gain supporters 
as well as safe havens to organize, train, and plot. These 
accelerants, the intensity and effects of which are likely to 
be uneven across different regions and countries, probably 
will also foster rural to urban international migration, further 
straining state resources and diminishing global and local 
counterterrorism efforts. 
• Global jihadist groups are likely to be the largest, most 
persistent transnational threat as well as a threat in their 
home regions. They benefit from a coherent ideology that 
promises to deliver a millenarian future, from strong orga -
nizational structures, and from the ability to exploit large 
areas of ungoverned or poorly governed territory, notably 
in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.
• Extreme “rightwing” and “leftwing” terrorists promoting a 
range of issues—racism, environmentalism, and anti-gov -
ernment extremism, for example—may revive in Europe, 
Latin America, North America, and perhaps other regions.
• Insurgent groups and sectarian conflicts—increasingly 
around ethno-nationalist and communal causes—will also 
continue to foster terrorism. The specific groups will wax 
and wane as some are defeated and others gain power. 
Although some groups will aspire to conduct transnational 
attacks and maintain cross border connections, most at -
tacks will continue to be perpetrated by local actors against 
local targets aimed at achieving local objectives. 
• Iran’s and Lebanese Hizballah’s efforts to solidify a Shia 
“axis of resistance” also might increase the threat of asym -
metric attacks on US, Israeli, Saudi, and others’ interests in 
the Middle East. 
Technology Evolving Tactics for Terrorists  
and Counterterrorism Forces
Most terrorist attacks during the next 20 years probably will 
continue to use weapons similar to those currently avail -
able—such as small arms and improvised explosives—be -cause these are generally sufficient, accessible, and reliable.  
However, technological advances, including AI, biotechnology, 
and the Internet of Things, may offer opportunities for terror -
ists to conduct high-profile attacks by developing new, more 
remote attack methods and to collaborate across borders. 
Terrorists will also seek weapons of mass destruction and oth -
er weapons and approaches that will allow them to conduct 
spectacular mass casualty attacks. For example, Islamic State 
of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has already launched mustard gas 
attacks and uses unmanned aerial vehicles extensively—as 
do Iranian-supported Shia militants. Autonomous delivery 
vehicles guided with the help of AI systems could enable a 
single terrorist to strike dozens of targets in the same inci -
dent. Augmented reality environments could also enable vir -
tual terrorist training camps, connecting experienced plotters 
protected by distant sanctuaries with potential operatives. 
Technological innovations that expand surveillance capacity 
may help governments to combat terrorists despite chal -
lenges posed by poor governance. Governments are likely 
to continue dramatically expanding the amount and types 
of information they collect as well as the tools to sort and 
organize that data. Advances in biometric identification, data 
mining, full-motion video analysis, and metadata analysis will 
provide governments with improved capabilities to identify 
terrorists and plotting. Development of precision long-range 
strike capabilities might undermine terrorist safe havens that 
are inaccessible to police or infantry forces.
Geopolitics Reshaping Counterterrorism Landscape
Shifting international power dynamics—in particular, the 
rise of China and major power competition—are likely to 
challenge US-led counterterrorism efforts and may make 
it increasingly difficult to forge bilateral partnerships or 
multilateral cooperation on traveler data collection and in -
formation-sharing efforts that are key to preventing terrorists 
from crossing borders and entering new conflict zones.  Poor 
countries probably will struggle with homegrown threats, 
particularly if international counterterrorism assistance is 
more limited. Some countries facing existential threats, such 
as insurgencies in which terrorists are active, may choose 
to forge non-aggression pacts that leave terrorists free to 
organize within their borders and others compelled to submit 
to terrorist rule over significant parts of their territory. 108SCENARIOS FOR 2040
CHARTING THE FUTURE AMID UNCERTAINTY
The previous chapters of Global Trends 2040 described how key structural 
forces are laying the foundations for our future world, including demo -
graphics, environment, economics, and technology, and then explored 
the dynamics emerging within societies, states, and the international system as 
communities and leaders respond to and engage with these forces. These sections 
point to a world that is increasingly out of balance and contested at every level, but 
this trajectory is not set in stone. 
To better understand how these conditions might play out differently during the 
next 20 years, we developed scenarios describing a range of possible global futures. 
Three key questions or uncertainties helped to shape these scenarios. 
• How severe are the looming global challenges? 
• How do states and nonstate actors engage in the world, including  
focus and type of engagement?
• Finally, what do states prioritize for the future? 
Image / BigstockA MORE CONTESTED WORLD109Using these questions, we have identified five plausible, distinctive, and illustrative stories of 
the future. Each reflects the key themes of shared global challenges, fragmentation, disequi -
librium, adaptation, and greater contestation. 
Three of the scenarios portray futures 
in which international challenges 
become incrementally more severe, 
and interactions are largely defined by 
the US-China rivalry. In Renaissance of 
Democracies , the United States leads a 
resurgence of democracies. In A World 
Adrift , China is the leading but not 
globally dominant state, and in Com -
petitive Coexistence , the United States 
and China prosper and compete for 
leadership in a bifurcated world. 
Two other scenarios depict more radical 
change. Both arise from particularly severe global discontinuities, and both defy assumptions 
about the global system. The US-China rivalry is less central in these scenarios because both 
states are forced to contend with larger, more severe global challenges and find that current 
structures are not matched to these challenges. Separate Silos  portrays a world in which glo -
balization has broken down, and economic and security blocs emerge to protect states from 
mounting threats. Tragedy and Mobilization  is a story of bottom-up, revolutionary change 
on the heels of devastating global environmental crises. TRAGEDY AND MOBILIZATIONSEPARATE SILOSCOMPETITIVE COEXISTENCEA WORLD ADRIFTRENAISSANCE OF DEMOCRACIESImage / BigstockGLOBAL TRENDS 2040110SCENARIO 1
RENAISSANCE OF DEMOCRACIES
In 2040, the world is in the midst of a 
resurgence of open democracies led by 
the United States and its allies. Rapid 
technological advancements fostered by 
public-private partnerships in the United 
States and other democratic societies are 
transforming the global economy, raising 
incomes, and improving the quality of life 
for millions around the globe. The rising 
tide of economic growth and technological 
achievement enables responses to global 
challenges, eases societal divisions, 
and renews public trust in democratic 
institutions. In contrast, years of increasing 
societal controls and monitoring in China 
and Russia have stifled innovation as 
leading scientists and entrepreneurs 
have sought asylum in the United States 
and Europe. HOW WE GOT THERE
The successful development and worldwide 
distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine in 2020-21 
focused global attention on the importance of 
scientific research, innovation, and technolog -
ical development to address emerging global 
challenges. Networks of research institutes, 
governmental agencies, nongovernmental 
organizations, and private corporations operat -
ing in Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development countries ramped up infor -
mation-sharing and developed coordinated 
approaches for research and development 
focused on artificial intelligence, biotech, and 
other technologies critical to revitalizing econo -
mies and addressing societal needs. During the 
succeeding 10 years, these efforts produced a 
series of groundbreaking advances, enhancing 
productivity and leading to an economic boom. 
Technological advances and economic growth 
combined to improve government capacity, 
enabling democratic governments to deliver 
services and provide security more effectively. 
With greater resources and improving services, 
these democracies launched initiatives to crack 
down on corruption, increase transparency, and 
improve accountability worldwide, boosting pub -
lic trust. These efforts helped to reverse years 
of social fragmentation and to restore a sense 
of civic nationalism. The combination of rapid 
innovation, a stronger economy, and greater 
societal cohesion enabled steady progress on 
climate and other challenges. Democratic soci -
eties became more resilient to disinformation

identify and debunk erroneous information. This 
environment restored a culture of vigorous but 
civil debate over values, goals, and policies. 
In contrast to the culture of collaboration 
prevailing in open societies, Russia and China 
failed to cultivate the high-tech talent, invest -
ment, and environment necessary to sustain 
continuous innovation. For China, the complete 
crackdown on Hong Kong in 2022 launched 
a decade of even greater digital repression, 
limiting any semblance of free expression. While 
they remained strategic military powers, both 
China and Russia were bogged down by domes -
tic strains. China’s aging population, high public 
and private debt, and inefficient state-directed 
economic model blocked the country’s transition 
to a consumer economy, and by 2029 China was 
stuck in the middle-income trap and had alien -
ated populations in developing countries. Russia 
declined because of a stagnating workforce, 
overreliance on energy exports, and post-Putin 
elite infighting. 
By the mid-2030s, the United States and its 
allies in Europe and Asia were the established 
global leaders in several technologies, includ -
ing AI, robotics, the Internet of Things, biotech, 
energy storage, and additive manufacturing. 
Democracies joined forces to set international 
standards to limit the negative consequences of 
technologies, including disinformation that had 
previously been so divisive in open societies. 
Multilateral cooperation spilled over into other 
areas, including cyber security, climate change 
mitigation, and rules for managing the seabed, 
the Arctic, and space. 
Technological success fostered a widely per -
ceived view among emerging and developing 
countries that democracies were more adapt -
able and resilient and better able to cope with 
growing global challenges. Years of unfulfilled 
Chinese promises also pushed some of the most 
populous countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, 
India, and Nigeria, to fully embrace transparent 
democracy. The rapid diffusion of advanced 
technologies to developing economies enabled 
faster than expected improvements in educa -
tion and job skills, building on remote learning Photo / Bigstock
Open, democratic systems proved better able to foster 
scientific research and technological innovation, catalyzing an 
economic boom. Strong economic growth, in turn, enabled 
democracies to meet many domestic needs, address global 
challenges, and counter rivals. 
The combination of better service provision and anticorruption 
efforts helped restore public trust in institutions and eventually 
mended many fractured societies.  Strong differences in public 
preferences and beliefs remained but these were worked 
out democratically.
US leadership proved central to multilateral coordination and 
focus on global challenges, building on established alliances 
and international institutions. A revival in the EU and Unit -
ed Kingdom, spurred on by technological innovation and 
economic growth, was key to broader success.
Over time, the combination of severe repression, stalled 
economic growth, and mounting demographic pressures 
undermined established authoritarian regimes in China and 
Russia, making them less predictable and more aggressive in 
their neighborhoods. KEY TAKEAWAYSplatforms developed during the pandemic. 
With China’s rise no longer seen as inevitable, 
leading states and investors turned to more 
rapidly growing economies with robust private 
sectors and innovation systems. 
Autocratic regimes tried but failed to push 
back against the growing strength of demo -
cratic allies. Russia threatened to intervene on 
behalf of ethnic Russian minorities in several 
of the non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) post-Soviet states, a move widely seen 
as a desperate last attempt by Moscow to 
divert attention from its domestic problems. 
China took threatening steps in the South 
China Sea. Both invested in asymmetric weap -
ons systems and disinformation technologies 
to counter US advantages while avoiding the 
costs of direct violence. GLOBAL TRENDS 2040112SCENARIO 2
A WORLD ADRIFT
In 2040, the international system is 
directionless, chaotic, and volatile as 
international rules and institutions are 
largely ignored by major powers such 
as China, regional players, and nonstate 
actors. Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
countries are plagued by slower 
economic growth, widening societal 
divisions, and political paralysis. China 
is taking advantage of the West’s 
troubles to expand its international 
influence, especially in Asia, but lacks 
the will and military might to take on 
global leadership, leaving many global 
challenges, such as climate change 
and instability in developing countries, 
largely unaddressed. HOW WE GOT THERE
Many of the world’s advanced and emerging 
market economies never fully recovered from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which was prolonged by a 
slow and inefficient vaccine rollout. By the late-
2020s, high national debt, the costs of caring for 
aging populations, and repeated climate events 
strained government budgets and crowded out 
other spending priorities, like education, infra -
structure, and scientific research and develop -
ment. Environmental, health, and economic crises 
had emerged gradually and sporadically over the 
decade, limiting political support and resources 
for governments to take action beyond emer -
gency relief and short-term economic stimulus. 
Economic hardships widened societal divisions 
and made it harder to reach political compromise 
on domestic and national security priorities.
Public frustrations and protests grew in many 
countries, but fragmented and competing oppo -
sition movements were unable to agree on clear 
demands and goals. Polarized societies, shaped 
by social media, led to more political deadlock 
and wild policy swings. These factionalized com -
munities, primarily in democratic countries, were 
unable to take effective action on the economy, 
the environment, migration, and foreign policy. 
Uncertainty surrounding crises and erratic gov -
ernment responses suppressed investment and 
job creation, plunging North America and Europe 
into a period of sluggish growth that many lik -
ened to Japan’s “lost decade” in the 1990s. Devel -
oping countries stagnated, with some turning to 
China and several suffering state failure, particu -
Photo / BigstockA MORE CONTESTED WORLD113larly in Africa and the Middle East. International 
challenges festered, ranging from terrorism to 
declining human development. Waves of mi -
grants fled conflict, environmental disaster, and 
economic decline and sought entry to wealthier 
countries in Europe, Asia, and North America.
During this period, China experienced many of 
the same environmental and societal problems 
but was better able to adapt because of stronger 
social cohesion and trust; agile direction from 
centralized authority; a proven ability to deliver 
jobs, goods, and services; and a political system 
that repressed competing voices. Although to 
a lesser degree than the growth in the boom 
years of the 1990s and 2000s, domestic demand 
generated gross domestic product (GDP) growth 
sufficient to allow China to surpass the United 
States to become the world’s largest economy by 
2030. Huge infrastructure projects aimed at man -
aging the effects of climate change, like the great 
Shanghai sea wall, became the envy of the world. 
Similar infrastructure development programs and 
steady foreign investment and assistance helped 
China gain influence in the developing world. 
Despite these gains, China continued to focus on 
countering perceived security threats around its 
periphery and at home. Beijing remained wary 
of international entanglements and leadership 
roles outside its immediate region. Rather than 
attempting to fashion a new global order, China 
concentrated on promoting industries and setting 
technology standards that advanced its develop -
ment goals. 
Many governments were content to profit from 
China’s large market and to pocket other benefits, 
like Chinese assistance with domestic surveillance 
and security systems, but few wanted to live 
under a China-led international order. The United 
States attempted to preserve ties to remaining 
allies in the region, but Japan and South Korea 
pursued increasingly independent military mod -
ernization programs and even their own nuclear 
weapons programs, in part out of concern about 
the reliability of the US security umbrella against 
China and North Korea. 
By 2035, China’s position in Asia became unassail -
able, especially after it successfully compelled the 
Government of Taiwan to come to the table for talks on unification. The triumph of China’s eco -
nomic and military coercive power was a turning 
point for the region, signaling Beijing’s ability to 
intimidate a close US partner and forcing China’s 
neighbors to worry that the Chinese People’s 
Liberation Army would turn its focus to settling 
other regional scores. No other states put them -
selves in a position to challenge China’s rise in the 
region. Russia generally aligned with China but 
became a lesser partner with each passing year. 
Although India benefited from growth in Asia, it 
could take years for it to be able to take on, much 
less contain, its more powerful neighbor.Photo / Bigstock
This is a directionless world in which international rules of 
behavior are no longer followed, global cooperation is limited, 
and technology fails to provide solutions. 
China’s increasingly aggressive moves in Asia elevates the risk 
of armed conflict with other regional powers, especially over 
critical resources. In contrast, developing countries with large 
unemployed youthful populations feel compelled to appease 
Chinese demands in hopes of securing much needed invest -
ment and aid.
Regional powers and nonstate actors, including corporations, 
have more influence over domains like cyber, space, and other 
technologies, but they lack the power to dominate the system. 
Weakened rules and lack of multilateral cooperation leave the 
world more vulnerable to individual hackers, terrorists, and 
criminal groups. Belligerents feel emboldened to pursue their 
goals with force, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. 
Large global problems, particularly climate change and health 
challenges, fester as states lack incentives to pursue collec -
tive actions and instead apply a patchwork of mismatched 
approaches. Nonetheless, some states, companies, and 
private organizations use the freedom to discover novel ways 
to enhance human health and worker productivity and to 
experiment with new approaches to economic development 
and governance. KEY TAKEAWAYSGLOBAL TRENDS 2040114SCENARIO 3

a robust trading relationship, but this 
economic interdependence exists alongside 
competition over political influence, 
governance models, technological 
dominance, and strategic advantage. The 
risk of major war is low, and international 
cooperation and technological innovation 
make global problems manageable over 
the near term for advanced economies, but 
longer term climate challenges remain. HOW WE GOT THERE
After a slow recovery from the COVID-19 crisis 
and an extended US-China trade war, by the 
late 2020s, pent-up demand and widespread 
popular frustration with underperforming 
economies led to a revival in the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) countries of market-driven economic 
policies to stimulate growth. Meeting in Cana -
da in 2031, the G7 endorsed plans for econom -
ic stimulus payments, liberalized trade and 
investment, streamlined taxes, and decreased 
regulations. Memories of an overbearing 
European Union (EU) having faded, Europeans 
agreed to a new round of trade liberalization, 
somewhat paradoxically under strengthened 
EU institutions. Weakened by years of de -
pressed oil prices, post-Putin Russia supported 
the new G7 economic consensus, and emerg -
ing economies, including Brazil and India, 
joined with important economic reforms. 
China rejected the OECD model and adhered 
to its closed state-directed system but priori -
tized economic growth and trade. Beijing and 
Washington took steps to stabilize economic 
relations, despite their mutual suspicion and 
contrasting political-economic models. The 
relationship has been fraught with disagree -
ments on core security issues and values, 
but seeking relief from the tight trade and 
investment restrictions of the 2020s led each 
side to conclude that they need each oth -
James Kenny / Unsplash | Macau Photo Agency / UnsplashA MORE CONTESTED WORLD115er to prosper; the two sides agreed in the 
2030s to protect their most vital common 
economic interests. 
China and the United States formed rival “com -
munities of common values” that compete 
for markets and resources under opposing 
domestic systems, one based on state direc -
tion, autocratic control, and public surveillance 
technologies and the other on private enter -
prise, democracy, personal freedom, and open 
information flows. The competition somewhat 
dampened fragmentation within countries as 
populations rallied to support their countries 
and leaders. Much of the work of managing 
the flow of trade and information was done by 
large corporations doing business globally. The 
United States, China, and like-minded states 
belonging to their respective camps intervened 
to prevent small conflicts from escalating to 
the point that they would threaten global 
economic progress and stability. Nevertheless, 
geopolitical competition, such as in the South 
China Sea, remained a persistent threat to eco -
nomic relations, and many internal conflicts in 
poor countries festered with little international 
effort to intervene. 
Rising commodity prices and demand for for -
eign workers stimulated an economic recovery 
that improved prospects for growing middle 
classes in some developing countries. Several 
advanced economies with aging populations 
set up guest worker programs, filling import -
ant service jobs while reducing uncontrolled 
migration using biometric tracking programs. 
Rising wages in China led to outsourcing and 
income gains in India, Southeast Asia, and 
parts of Africa. Nonetheless, large youthful 
populations in the developing world, especial -
ly in Africa, did not benefit from the reviving 
global economy.
Advances in renewable energy generation and 
storage and in carbon capture technologies 
dampened the growth of emissions, but not fast enough to prevent some catastrophic 
impacts. Wealthy countries were able to 
invest in adaptation measures at home to 
protect at risk populations, but developing 
countries lagged behind and suffered the 
most from increased disasters, presenting 
second-order security challenges.James Kenny / Unsplash | Macau Photo Agency / Unsplash
The US-China rivalry and other state-to-state relations are 
channeled into competition for markets, resources, and brand 
reputation within mutually accepted rules in these areas.  
Publics rally around their governments in the competition, 
tempering societal fragmentation. 
Strengthened economic interdependence lowers the risk 
of the major powers pursuing armed conflict; most of them 
engage in influence operations, corporate espionage, and 
cyber attacks that allow them to achieve goals without risking 
destructive wars. 
The central security challenge is how to keep the geopolitical 
competition between the United States and China from under -
mining the economic cooperation upon which their prosperity 
and the global economy depends. 
Long-term stability remains at risk from growing climate chal -
lenges that were ignored in favor of near-term economic gains; 
technological innovations and economic prosperity have lulled 
leaders into believing that they can put off making hard choices 
on climate change. KEY TAKEAWAYSGLOBAL TRENDS 2040116SCENARIO 4
SEPARATE SILOS 
In 2040, the world is fragmented into 
several economic and security blocs of 
varying size and strength, centered on 
the United States, China, the European 
Union (EU), Russia, and a few regional 
powers, and focused on self-sufficiency, 
resiliency, and defense. Information 
flows within separate cyber-sovereign 
enclaves, supply chains are reoriented, 
and international trade is disrupted. 
Vulnerable developing countries are caught 
in the middle with some on the verge of 
becoming failed states. Global problems, 
notably climate change, are spottily 
addressed, if at all.HOW WE GOT THERE
By the early 2030s, cascading global challenges 
from decades of job losses in some countries 
in part because of globalization, heated trade 
disputes, and health and terrorist threats 
crossing borders prompted states to raise 
barriers and impose trade restrictions to 
conserve resources, protect citizens, and pre -
serve domestic industries. Many economists 
thought that economic decoupling or separa -
tion could not really happen because of the 
extensive interdependence of supply chains, 
economies, and technology, but security con -
cerns and governance disputes helped drive 
countries to do the unthinkable, despite the 
extraordinary costs.
Countries with large domestic markets or 
sizeable neighbors successfully redirected 
their economies, but many developing econo -
mies with limited resources and market access 
were hit hard as both import and export 
markets dried up. Economic stagnation fos -
tered widespread insecurity across Africa, the 
Middle East, and South Asia, fueling a retreat 
to subnational ethnic and religious identities, 
strained societies, fragmented states, and 
spreading instability. New waves of migrants 
headed to the developed world hoping to 
escape poverty, poor governance, and increas -
ingly harsh environmental conditions. Their 
hopes were dashed when political pushback 
prompted destination countries to block 
most migration. A MORE CONTESTED WORLD117As physical barriers went up, dependence on 
digital commerce and communications soared, 
but a combination of information manage -
ment challenges and repeated data security 
breaches led those states with strong cyber 
controls, like China and Iran, to reinforce their 
cyber barricades. Then states that once advo -
cated for an open Internet set up new closed, 
protected networks to limit threats and screen 
out unwanted ideas. By 2040, only the United 
States and a few of its closest allies maintained 
the semblance of an open Internet while most 
of the world operated behind strong firewalls. 
With the trade and financial connections that 
defined the prior era of globalization dis -
rupted, economic and security blocs formed 
around the United States, China, the EU, 
Russia, and India. Smaller powers and other 
states joined these blocs for protection, to 
pool resources, and to maintain at least some 
economic efficiencies. Advances in AI, ener -
gy technologies, and additive manufacturing 
helped some states adapt and make the blocs 
economically viable, but prices for consumer 
goods rose dramatically. States unable to join 
a bloc were left behind and cut off.
Security links did not disappear completely. 
States threatened by powerful neighbors 
sought out security links with other powers for 
their own protection or accelerated their own 
programs to develop nuclear weapons, as the 
ultimate guarantor of their security. Small con -
flicts occurred at the edges of these new blocs, 
particularly over scarce resources or emerging 
opportunities, like the Arctic and space. Poorer 
countries became increasingly unstable, 
and with no interest by major powers or the 
United Nations in intervening to help restore 
order, conflicts became endemic, exacerbat -
ing other problems. Lacking coordinated, 
multilateral efforts to mitigate emissions and 
address climate changes, little was done to 
slow greenhouse gas emissions, and some 
states experimented with geoengineering with 
disastrous consequences.
Separating economies has dire consequences, including mas -
sive financial losses for countries and corporations, as supply 
chains fracture, markets are lost, and once lucrative sectors, 
like travel and tourism, decline. The resulting economies are 
less vulnerable to future supply chain disruptions but also 
less efficient. 
Larger countries with abundant resources, few nearby ene -
mies, and defensible borders, such as the United States and 
Canada, are better able to adapt than most others. The focus 
on self-sufficiency makes some states more resilient even as 
others founder. 
To maintain domestic stability in this world, states adopt mixed 
political models combining elements of democracy and author -
itarianism, increasing surveillance and potentially repression. 
Many states turn to exclusionary forms of nationalism to unify 
majority populations against perceived foreign enemies. 
Unable to attract talent globally or sustain international 
collaboration, technological innovation atrophies. Wealthy 
countries begin to compensate by shifting resources to 
domestic education.
International organizations and collective action to tackle 
climate change, healthcare disparities, and poverty falter. 
Countries independently adapt to the catastrophic impacts, 
significantly increasing the incentive for risky solutions.
Focused on internal security, the world’s larger militaries avoid 
direct armed conflict. Rival blocs compete for control over 
scarce resources, leading to smaller wars or other means of 
diverting attention from domestic problems and rallying public 
support against foreign enemies. Nuclear weapons proliferate.KEY TAKEAWAYSGLOBAL TRENDS 2040118SCENARIO 5
TRAGEDY AND MOBILIZATION
In 2040, a global coalition, led by the 
European Union (EU) and China working 
with nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) and revitalized multilateral 
institutions, is implementing far-reaching 
changes designed to address climate 
change, resource depletion, and poverty 
following a global food catastrophe caused 
by climate events and environmental 
degradation. Richer countries shift to help 
poorer ones manage the crisis and then 
transition to low carbon economies through 
broad aid programs and transfers of 
advanced energy technologies, recognizing 
how rapidly these global challenges 
spread across borders. HOW WE GOT THERE
In the early 2030s, the world was in the midst 
of a global catastrophe. Rising ocean tempera -
tures and acidity devastated major fisheries 
already stressed by years of overfishing. At the 
same time, changes in precipitation patterns 
depressed harvests in key grain producing 
areas around the world, driving up food prices, 
triggering widespread hoarding, and disrupt -
ing the distribution of food supplies, leading to 
global famine. A wave of unrest spread across 
the globe, protesting governments’ inability 
to meet basic human needs and bringing 
down leaders and regimes. In one of many 
incidents in the Western world, thousands of 
people were killed in three days of violence in 
Philadelphia triggered by social media rumors 
about bread shortages. 
The ongoing famines catalyzed a global move -
ment that advocated bold systemic change to 
address environmental problems. Across the 
world, younger generations, shaped by the 
COVID-19 pandemic and traumatized by the 
threat of running out of food, joined together 
across borders to overcome resistance to re -
form, blaming older generations for destroying 
their planet. They threw their support behind 
NGOs and civil society organizations that were 
involved in relief efforts and developed a larg -
er global following than those governments 
that were perceived to have failed their popu -
lations. As the movement grew, it took on oth -
er issues including global health and poverty.
Image / BigstockA MORE CONTESTED WORLD119After Green parties swept democratic elections 
in several European countries between 2034 
and 2036, the EU launched a campaign within 
the United Nations (UN) to greatly expand 
international aid programs and to set a new 
target date for meeting the UN’s Sustainable 
Development Goals by 2050. Hurt badly by the 
famine and hoping to quell unrest in its major 
cities, China announced its support for the EU 
effort, which the Chinese Communist Party 
portrayed as a new national patriotic mission 
and the kind of global restructuring it had long 
advocated. Others, including Australia, Can -
ada, and the United States, slowly joined the 
movement as environmentally focused parties 
gained political strength, winning several 
elections, despite strong continued resistance 
from some domestic groups arguing that their 
countries were better positioned to adapt to a 
changing climate and should prioritize domes -
tic industries and constituencies. 
The EU initiative resulted in the creation of a 
new international organization, the Human 
Security Council, in cooperation with develop -
ing countries, which focused on 21st Century 
transnational security challenges. Open to 
both states and nonstate actors, membership 
required a commitment to verifiable actions to 
improve food, health, and environmental secu -
rity, even if these were perceived as painful for 
wealthier states and groups. Members could 
easily be expelled for noncompliance, and face 
grassroots, popular backlashes and boycotts, 
similar to the Anti-Apartheid Movement of the 
last century. By 2038, global attitudes about 
the environment and human security were 
being transformed by growing recognition of 
the unsustainability of past practices. 
States and large corporations concentrated 
investments to advance technological solu -
tions to food, climate, and health challenges 
and to provide essential aid to the hardest hit 
populations. Corporate goals expanded to em -
brace serving a wider range of stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, 
and communities. 
Not everyone has come on board. Russia and 
some states in the Organization of Petro -
leum Exporting Countries resisted change, 
and some communities found the new global 
ethos threatening to traditional values and 
patronage systems. Extremists resorted to 
cyber attacks and terrorism to draw attention 
to their causes. States with powerful energy 
interests, such as Iran, Russia, and some Gulf 
Arab states, faced disruptive political move -
ments that threaten to lead to a prolonged 
period of political and social conflict.
An existential threat catalyzes a bottom-up social movement 
that transforms multilateral cooperation, disrupts economic 
incentives, and offers nonstate actors greater influence. 
Major power competition among individual states is rechan -
neled to address more pressing global challenges; the geopo -
litical hierarchy is reshuffled, creating once unlikely partner -
ships between progressive European political parties and the 
Chinese Communist Party. Europe takes the lead in promoting 
sustainable development, while China adopts and promotes 
new energy technologies. 
Countries beholden to fossil fuel industries are the slowest to 
get on board with the global revolution, creating a global back -
lash to their leadership, products, and brands. The second- 
and third-order implications of the new political movements 
create long-term challenges for their economies. 
With broad popular support, NGOs, multilateral organizations, 
and activist groups have unprecedented ability to influence 
standards, marshal resources, hold violators accountable, and 
prod states to act. In some cases, global priorities take prece -
dence over national interests. KEY TAKEAWAYSImage / Bigstockhis section of the Global Trends report provides 20-year projections of

Abstract 
Economic  frictions  such as information asymmetries and economic  forces  such as 
economies of scale and scope give rise to financial intermediaries. These frictions and 
forces also shape market st ructure. While technological advances are not new to 
finance, digital innovation has brought major improvements in connectivity  of 
systems, in computing  power and cost, and in newly created  and usable data. These 
improvements have alleviated transactio n costs and given rise to new business 
models and new entrants. As technology has increased inform ation exchange and 
reduced transaction costs,  the production of financial services could be 
disaggregated. Specialized players have un bundled financial services, allowing 
consumers to find and assemble their prefe rred suites of products. However, classic 
economic forces remain relevant even in an age of digital production. Economies of 
scale and scope and network effects are presen t in many aspects of financial services 
production, including customer acquisition, funding, compliance activities, data and 
capital (including trust capital). Despite advances in technology, consumer search and 
assembly costs remain significant. These forces encourage re-bundling, and confer 
advantages to large multi-product provider s, including technology (big tech) firms 
expanding into financial services from adjace nt markets. The digital transformation of 
financial services gives rise to a set of im portant policy issues regarding competition, 
regulatory perimeters and ensuring a le vel playing field. Potential outcomes 
regarding competition, conc entration and market compos ition include a “barbell” 
outcome composed of a few large providers and many niche players. Authorities must 
coordinate across financial regulation, compet ition, and industry regulatory bodies to 
manage trade-offs between stability and int egrity, competition and efficiency, and 
consumer protection and privacy.

 Executive summary 
Finance is undergoing a profound transforma tion. Digital technologies are reshaping 
payments, lending, insurance and wealth management – a proce ss that the COVID-19 
pandemic has accelerated. While this is ma king financial services in many economies 
more diverse, competitive, efficient, and incl usive, it may also increase concentration 
in markets. Moreover, new risks may arise to  a range of key public policy goals. This 
paper draws on the underlying economics of financial services and their industrial 
organization to examine – with  recent empirical evidence – the implications of digital 
innovation for market structure and attendant policies, including financial and competition regulation. 
The key organizing framework for the discussion is economic  frictions  such as 
information asymmetries and economic  forces  such as economies of scale and scope. 
These frictions and forces give rise to financial intermediaries and shape market 
structure. We show that while technological advances are not new to finance, digital 
innovation has brought ma jor improvements in the connectivity  of systems and in 
computing  power and cost, which have resulted in large volumes of newly created  and 
usable data. For example, mobile phone usage has surged globally, social and 
economic activity has shifted online (oft en to platform-based businesses), and new 
technologies like cloud computing have become widely adopted.  
These improvements have alleviated fr ictions, blurred fi rm and industry 
boundaries, and given rise to new busi ness models. New, often smaller and 
specialized financial technology (fintech ) players have unbundled services (see 
definitions below). However, classic economic forces remain relevant. Economies of 
scale and network effects are strong in di gital platforms and cl oud computing. These 
scale effects, alongside economies of sc ope encourage re-bundling, and allow large 
technology (big tech) firms and other new players to deepen their inroads into core 
financial products. Available evidence shows that big tech firms in particular are 
rapidly expanding their footprin t in finance, and can use big data in ways that reduce 
the need for collateral. Meanwh ile, incumbent financial inst itutions have adapted by 
adopting new technologies and disaggregatin g their production of financial services 
to improve efficiency. 
Digital innovation could drive a range of  industrial organization outcomes. On 
the one hand, digital technology enables ni che providers to reach a target customer 
base and be economically viable. On the ot her hand, customer acquisition, funding, 
“assembly,” and switching costs tend to favo ur larger providers of digital financial 
services. One possibility is a “barbell” ou tcome composed of a few large players and 
many niche players. The large, multi-pr oduct players could include traditional 
financial institutions, fintechs and big techs – thus both incumbents and new entrants. 
Small players may include fintechs as we ll as geographically or sector focused 
incumbents.  
While a ‘‘barbell’’ is not the only potential outcome, it is a central case given the 
economic forces at work. It is a potentia l steady-state market structure as some 
participants leverage scale economies and network effects to grow larger, while 
innovation continues to result in new entrants. There will be a tendency for players to 
either hyper-focus or to aim for the large,  multi-product space. However, continued 
atomization, stalled re-aggregation, or lim its on entry could result in a different 
configuration.

 This analysis gives rise to importan t policy issues regarding competition, 
regulatory perimeters, and ensuring a leve l playing field. Concentration risks may 
increase in the provision of financial servic es to end-users, and in the provision of 
infrastructure to financial institutions. Ma rket structures that concentrate data and 
supercharge network effects could redu ce intermediation costs and broaden 
inclusion. In many markets, however, the resulting market power might be seen as 
detrimental. Competition regulators will have to strike a balance appropriate to the needs of their markets, since different soci eties will attach diffe rent preferences to 
market structure outcomes.  
At the same time, financial regulatory authorities are working to manage policy 
trade-offs among (i) stability and integrity, (ii) competition and efficiency, and (iii) 
consumer protection and priv acy. The barbell outcome, for example, could present 
challenges in terms of stability with respect to both large and small payers. Widespread access to data ra ises privacy concer ns. Regulators need to balance the 
innovation and efficiency br ought by new entrants with the potential challenges for 
oversight, enforcement and consumer protec tion. Emerging policy approaches – such 
as new anti-trust rules for the digital era, data mobility requirements and data 
protection laws – may help to mitigate th e policy trade-offs. Yet the responsibility for 
these changes generally lies with different public authorities, and with legislatures. To 
navigate this new territory effectively, and to balance the necessary policy goals, 
authorities will need to collaborate. This w ill need to occur both domestically – with 
cooperation between central banks, financ ial sector regulators, other industry 
regulators, and compet ition and data protection auth orities – and across borders. 
Such collaboration can help to ensure regula tory consistency and peer learning within 
and between countries, and ultimately bette r development outcomes for the country.  
 Definitions of key terms used in this paper 
Digital financial services (DFS) are financial services whic h rely on digital technologies for their delivery and use by 
consumers.  
Fintech refers to digital technologies that have the pote ntial to transform the provision of financial services 
spurring the development of new – or modify existing – business models, app lications, processes,  and products. In 
practice, the term “fintech” is also broadly used to denote the ongoing wa v e  o f  n e w  D F S .  E x a m p l e s  o f  t h e s e  
technologies include web, mobile, cloud services, machine learning, digital ID, and application prog ramming interfaces 
(APIs).  
A fintech firm is one that specializes in offering DFS to consumers, or enables other pr oviders to offer DFS. While 
many of these companies are relatively  new to the financial sector, others  are by now well-established public 
companies. Examples of fintechs incl ude digital payment providers  (eg PayPal), financial infrastructure/connectivity 
providers (eg Plaid), digital insurers (eg BIMA, Policy Baz aar), peer-to-peer lending platforms (eg Afluenta, Funding 
Circle, Investree).  
A big tech firm is a large company whose primary activity  is digital services. Examples of big techs include online 
search engines, social media platforms, e-commerce platform s, ride-hailing platforms, and mobile network operators. 
Numerous big techs have started to o ffer DFS, leveraging their large customer bases and the data they have on 
transactions and activities that give ri se to payments or a need for credit, insurance or other financial services.

 1. Introduction 
Digital innovation is transforming financial services. Innovations in financial 
technology such as mobile money, peer-to- peer (P2P) or marketplace lending, robo-
advice, insurance technology  (insurtech) and crypto-asse ts have emerged around the 
world.2 In the past decade, fintech has al ready driven greater access to and 
convenience of financial services for retail users. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud services, and distributed ledger tech nology (DLT) are tran sforming wholesale 
markets in areas as diverse as financial ma rket trading and regula tory and supervisory 
technology (regtech and suptech). A host of new firms have sprung up to apply new technologies to meet cust omer demand and most incumben ts indicate that digital 
transformation is a strategic priority (F eyen et al 2021). Indeed, leading banks are 
rapidly closing gaps in digitization of inte rnal processes and cust omer offerings, to 
compete with fintechs and th e large technology (big tech) firms that have also 
entered the fray (BIS 2019; Frost et al 2019). 
These developments have the potentia l to make markets more diverse, 
competitive, efficient, and in clusive, but could also increase concentration. Innovation 
has introduced competition and increased inclusion, particularly in emerging markets 
and developing economies (Pazar basioglu et al 2020; Frost et al 2021). Fintech seems 
to have thrived particularly in markets where the financial system had been less 
developed (FSB 2020; Didier et al 2021). However, the underlying economics of 
intermediation combined with new technology may lead to concentration among both traditional and new financial serv ices providers. Monopolistic or anti-
competitive behaviours by big technology pl atforms are already being scrutinized. As 
financial services move towards similar te chnology-driven configurations, regulators 
are grappling with questions of how best to  regulate and supervise a landscape that 
is increasingly characterized by new pl ayers and business models; and to address 
potential challenges to financial stability, financial integrity, fair competition, and 
consumer protection (including data privacy).  
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated th e digital transformati on. In particular, 
the need for digital connectivity to replac e physical interactio ns between consumers 
and providers, and in the processes that produce financial services, will be even more important as economies, financial services providers, businesses and individuals 
navigate the pandemic and the eventual post-COVID-19 world. For instance, the 
pandemic has already accelerated the shift to  digital payments (Aue r et al 2020a). It 
has also intensified e-commerce (BIS 2020; Alfonso et al 2021), which may benefit big 
tech firms and their activities in financ e. Countries with more stringent COVID-19 
policies and lower community mobility experienced a larger increase in financial app downloads in the wake of the outbreak (Did ier et al 2021). Finally, it may be speeding 
up work on central bank digital cu rrencies (CBDCs) (Auer et al 2020b). 
This paper examines the implications of digital innovation for market structure 
and attendant policies, including financial and competition regulation. There have 
been a number of surveys of regulatory responses. This paper takes a step back, to 
look at what the economic th eory of banking and financial intermediation can tell us 
about how technology may drive industrial organization in the sector, and how that 
might inform further policy responses. Th e paper roots the impa ct of the digital

 transformation of finance in how innovati on has enabled provi ders to address long-
standing challenges of financial intermedia tion – including asymmetric information, 
uncertainty, incomplete markets, and fix ed and variable costs of production. The 
paper describes how digital innovation affect s these key economic frictions in finance, 
and alters the financial services value chai n and industrial organization. The forces 
driving these changes, an d potential outcomes in terms of industry structure, lead to 
insights for policy makers on how to harness the benefits of fintech, while mitigating 
some of the risks, particularly around comp etition and market stru cture. The focus is 
on economic and techno logical forces that apply broadly across financial services. It 
recognizes that the sector  encompasses a wide range of  different products and 
services, and is composed of numerous sub-markets that might use different 
technologies or have different economic stru ctures. These may thus  diverge in market 
structure and competition outcomes.  
2. Economic frictions and forces in financial services 
Fundamentally, financial firms, like other fi rms, owe their existence to transaction 
costs (Baltensperger 1980). In the absence of  complete trust between parties, market 
interactions on the producti on side and the customer side are characterized by risks, 
due eg to principal-agent ch allenges and incomplete or asymmetric information. 
Solving these to reduce risk and create tr ust imposes costs on both institutions and 
consumers, including contracting, search, an d verification costs. For example, lending 
is characterized by information asymmetries ex ante , as lenders need to determine 
the risk profile of potential borrowers, and ex post , as they need to monitor the 
repayment capacity of borrowers (Dewatri point and Tirole 1994). A fundamental 
feature of payment markets is  the need to keep track of payment obligations, and to 
verify the identity of account holders or the veracity of payment tokens (Kahn and 
Roberds 2009). Different actors in the paym ent processing chain must trust that the 
other links will not expose them to fraud or liability, and customers require 
trustworthy counterpar ties with which to lodge funds and reliable processes for their 
delivery. Financial market investment and in surance are subject to uncertainty around 
future outcomes, adverse selection, and moral hazard. Those creating investment 
products rely on sound underwriting and ex ecution services to be able to offer a 
quality product to their customers. Customers in turn must be able to trust the 
soundness of the investments and of the operations that underlie their ability to buy 
and sell.  
As in other industries, internalization of ac tivities within a single financial services 
firm overcomes principal-agent and asymme tric information challenges, to align 
interests and monitor actions. This ensures trusted interactions across teams. Linking 
deposit taking to lending enables close coordination of asset and liability 
management. Combining payments executio n with account management allows the 
provider to confirm availability of funds before transfer instructions are carried out. Linking underwriting, trading, and sales allows firms to design new investment products in line with market cond itions and investor preferences. 
The presence of uncertainty about fu ture outcomes, for example whether a 
borrower will go bankrupt, adds  further frictions. Because it is difficult to define a 
contract for all potential future states of the world – and the resu lting solvency status 
of the borrower – markets are not complete in the Arrow-Debreu (1954) sense. As a  
 
BIS Papers No 117 3
 result, resource allocations may be inefficien t: some borrowers will have to pay higher 
interest rates to compensate the lender for expected (but not necessarily realized) 
losses, costly insurance may be required, or  some loans will not be made at all. More 
generally, the difficulty of tailoring products  to the precise circumstances of different 
customers, due either to as ymmetric information or uncertainty about outcomes, 
means that pricing, maturity, or other terms will inevitably be less than perfectly suited 
to the circumstances of some clients. The y may decline the offer,  or the intermediary 
may deem certain segments unviable commerc ially. Either way, some customers will 
not be served.  
Financial services companies are struct ured to address particular information 
gaps and frictions related to  intermediation. Banks develop ed to address the maturity 
transformation challenge resulting from incomplete information about future 
liquidity needs of depositors. They also address the transactio nal costs and risk 
management needs of intermedi ating investments across individuals who lack direct 
knowledge of other counterparties or info rmation about economic activities taking 
place elsewhere. Banks divers ify across large numbers of borrowers to better manage 
uncertainty of outcomes. Exchanges and br okers address the sear ch and transaction 
costs of individual issuers and investors, reducing information asymmetries through 
listing requirements and publishing prices, and providing infrastr ucture and services 
to match and enable transactions between buyers and sellers who don’t know each 
other. Because so much of the intermedi ation process is not readily visible to 
customers, and risks may only  be realized after an extended period of time, the 
consumer need for trusted providers manife sts more than in other industries. A 
provider that gains cu stomer trust with one product can leverage that trust to offer 
other services. 
Providing these services requir es not only information and financial  resources, 
but also real resources. These include the la bour, equipment, and premises to 
produce financial contracts, manage accounts, and process customer transactions. 
The mix of labour, physical capital, financ ial capital, and trust capital will vary by 
business type, and has been  rapidly changing. Nevertheless, financial services 
production is subject, in varying degrees, to the same frictions that  affect production 
in other industries, including real resource  indivisibility and fix ed costs. Thus, while 
financial intermediation is subject to unique  information and transaction frictions, as 
an industry it is also subject to familiar economic forces observed across sectors.  
Basic economic forces are at play across  both the financial and real resources 
deployed by financial firms. These include: 
• Economies of scale.  On the supply side, traditional financial firms have had large 
fixed cost investment needs for the cr eation and maintenance of back-office 
systems and physical distribution networ ks to connect to the consumer. There 
may also be fixed costs of minimum capital requirements  and regulatory 
compliance operations. As in any industry  with fixed costs, economies of scale 
emerge when a larger producer can amorti ze those costs over a larger customer 
base. Scale also permits the development of  a diversified balance sheet to better 
manage liquidity and credit risk. Scale can re duce the marginal cost of risk-taking 
(Mester 2010) and allow better pricing an d/or ability to serve a wider range of 
customers.  
• Economies of scope.  Also on the supply side, financial intermediaries enjoy 
economies of scope by bundling interdep endent financial services that can be 
delivered through the same physical customer interfac es and leverage the same  
 
4 BIS Papers No 117
 balance sheet. Cross-selling loan products and insurance, and offering both asset 
and liability products, can create synergies and reduce costs. Economies of scope 
are further enforced by the demand side as many customers prefer a 
conveniently offered suite of products. This  also reinforces the institution’s role 
of gatekeeper to the customer.  
• Network effects.  On the demand side, network e ffects (or “externalities”) are 
significant in financial services such as  payments, where the value of the network 
to all users (both payers and payees) in creases when the nu mber of connected 
users increases. A bank serving a business, suppliers and as well as its customers, 
could more efficiently connect counterpar ties to quickly transfer payments and 
provide working capital.  
Given the available technology and prev ailing regulation, these forces have 
historically conferred advantages to “first movers” and large, vertically and horizontally integrated players.  This has been particularly  true for capital-intensive 
products such as lending, for institutions that put consumers’ savings at risk such as 
deposit taking, and for capital and networ k-intensive areas such as payments.  
2.1 The Impact of digital innov ation on key economic frictions 
The adoption of technology is not new in the financial sector, but a number of 
constraints had defined the operating enviro nment until recently. In the late 20th 
century, the industry was already charac terized by a relatively high degree of 
computerization since most financial services were dematerialized.3 Only payments 
frequently required physical ca sh or a check, and onboarding for new products and 
services often required in-person or paper-based processes. Still, reaching and connecting to customers routinely required ph ysical infrastructure such as branches 
and automated teller machines (ATMs). Customers wishing to transact with 
counterparties using other banks had to us e expensive and sometimes slow or risky 
processes such as wire transfers. Even af ter the advent of digital payment systems 
and the dematerialization of se curities, connectivity remain ed a barrier to entry – an 
institution typically had to be licensed an d part of the consortium of banks or 
brokerage houses to participate in a tr ansactional network. Furthermore, data 
processing and storage were expensive,  requiring the operation of bespoke 
mainframes and data centres. This limited the volume of information that could be 
gathered, stored, analysed, and exchanged to improve e fficiency, better price risk, 
and tailor products to customer needs. 
Technology advances in connectivity, data processing, and storage 
Significant technology advances have taken place in two key areas that have contributed to the cu rrent wave of technology-based finance:  
• Increased connectivity. Inte rnet and mobile technology  have rapidly increased 
the ability to transfer information and interact remotely, both between 
businesses and directly to the consumer. Through mobile and smartphones, 
which are near-ubiquitous, technology ha s increased access to, and the efficiency 
of, direct delivery channels and promises  lower-cost, tailored financial services. 
 
3  This included data centres, front and back-office connectivity to core banking systems, branch 
automation, and interoperable payments networks co nnecting financial firms, including wire services, 
automated clearing houses (ACH), and ATM networks.  
 
BIS Papers No 117 5
 As of late 2019, GSMA estimated that there were more than 5 billion mobile 
subscriptions worldwide. Building on this user base, there were nearly one billion 
registered mobile money accoun ts (Graph 1). In principle, most financial services 
can be now delivered directly and digitally , vastly increasing access to finance. 
An emerging class of services and assets  could in principle even be delivered 
without the need for an intermediary. At the same time, the rapid increase in 
connectivity has enabled large network e ffects and strengthen ed the position of 
established intermediaries offering mobile  networks and subscriptions, such as 
telecom companies, particularly in some emerging market and developing 
economies (EMDEs). Furthermore, the de velopment of widely used applications 
and services like social media, search and social communication have enabled 
more peer-to-peer casual interactions. These are increasingly being tapped for 
economic interactions, as well. This has strengthened the position of the companies providing these services. 
• Low-cost computing and data stora ge. Computing efficiency has risen 
exponentially, as the cost of data stor age has rapidly declined. The Cray-1 was 
the world’s fastest “supercomputer” fr om 1976-1982, operating at 80 MHz, 
weighing 5.5 tons, an d costing $10 million.
4 The A11 chip powering an iPhone X 
runs at a speed of 2.39 GHz – 30 times faster  – and at a small fraction of the size 
and cost.5 Data that required a room  full of tape or hard drives in 1980 can fit on 
a micro secure digital (SD) card today. As the cost of data storage has fallen, from 
USD 0.11 per gigabyte in 2009 to 0.02 in 2020, the volume of data being 
generated globally has increa sed exponentially – to an estimated 48 zettabytes 
(48 trillion gigabytes) in 2020 (Graph 2). The ability to process such data rapidly 
has also risen with advances in artifici al intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
(FSB 2017). Digital technologies like smartp hones, and activities like social media 
and e-commerce generate a wealth of new data. Much of the new data relates 
to individuals (“personal data”) or firm s, and can be processed automatically to

 identify the characteristics of existing or  potential clients and offer the financial 
services that best fit them. 
Data, networks, and new business models 
These advances have enabled the creation of huge amount s of capturable data, new 
tools to analyse those data, and new busi ness models leveraging insights from the 
analysis. Connectivity generates and captures  a variety of data, and digitalization of 
more activities generates higher  volumes of data at an ev en greater velocity. Storage 
and processing capacity a llows data to be organiz ed, validated, and analysed, 
including through computationally intensive techniques such as AI, including 
machine learning applications on vast troves of data. Digitally “native” data with high 
volume, variety, velocity and veraci ty are referred to as “Big Data.”6 These 
characteristics mean that  not only did big data emerge  due to increased digitization 
of activities (including those facilitated by connectivity), but big data also requires  low 
cost storage and high capaci ty computing power to be us eful. Big data emerges from 
a variety of sources, including the location  and usage data from mobile phones, the 
contact information from social networks , the delivery information from logistics 
companies, and the sales data from retail ou tlets and payments networks. Big data is 
being used in a wide range of traditiona l financial services and new types of 
businesses to improve credit analysis, pr ocess efficiency, risk  management, product 
design, customer service and other areas. Examples include Trus ting Social, which 
uses call records to develop credit scores , and Tenda Pago, which uses retailers’ 
consumer goods order information as a basi s for working capital loans. Data can be 
an important resource for, and driver of , economic development (World Bank 2021).

 These advances also enable a number of  new business models for the provision 
of technology, one of which is cloud-bas ed computing. This combines the ability of 
an enterprise or individual  to connect to externally  operated and managed data 
centres with low-cost computing power and st orage. The result is an ability to obtain 
infrastructure on demand and r educe the fixed cost barrier to entry to offer financial 
services. Surveys show  that cloud adoption has proc eeded rapidly. For instance, in 
Europe, Eurostat estimates that over half of  enterprises in the Nordic countries used 
cloud storage in 2018, while firms in the Neth erlands, Ireland, UK and Malta have also 
seen rapid adoption (Graph 3). Recent ev idence suggests that cloud adoption has 
even accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic (McKinsey 2020). For instance, a 
recent survey of IT leaders from 250 mi d-sized companies around the world found 
that 82% of respondents increased cloud us age as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and 91% are planning a more strategic us e of cloud in the near future (Snow 
2020). Innovation in cloud services is pr oceeding apace, as growing volumes of 
venture capital and private equity funding have flown into new applications of cloud 
technology and development operations (DevOps) over the past three years 
(Graph 4). 
Another result of the technology adva nces described above has been the wide 
emergence of platform-based business models. Fintechs, big techs and even some 
incumbents have moved increasingly to a role as “matchmakers” between different 
users and providers on their platforms (Croxso n et al 2021). These businesses leverage 
the connectivity of individuals and businesses, and the ability to quickly and easily 
collaborate, discover counterparties, and pa ckage and deliver a range of digital and 
physical goods and services. Platforms are two-sided or multi-sided markets, and 
benefit from network effects that create  more value for each participant with 
increased numbers of other participants.

 The platform provider also  benefits from the networ k effects that attract more 
users, transaction volumes from which to earn  revenues, and data th at in turn enables 
the provider to target users with more g oods or services. The ability to connect large 
numbers of users to a wide array of services  has led to the rise of so-called ‘super 
apps’ such as WeChat, AliPay, and (perha ps) Facebook. These and other technology 
companies operating platforms with large customer bases are often referred to as big 
techs (Frost et al 2019). For this analysis , almost any large company that has or can 
leverage big data against a large customer base could become a big tech. Examples 
include telecom providers like Vodafone M-Pe sa, and retailers such as Walmart, which 
is already a substantial e-commerce player and in early 2021 announced intentions 
to create a fintech operation. It could al so include business-to-business (B2B) players 
such as consumer goods manufacturers and distributors. Among other features, 
platform operators can leverage digita l delivery channels and application 
programming interfaces (APIs) to seamle ssly “embed” financial services such as 
payments or loans into non-financial services  such as e-commerce or social media.  
Network effects in these business models can lead to market concentration and 
competition concerns. The effect of adding  users on one side of a platform market 
(ride-hailing drivers, for example), creating  more value to users on the other side 
(riders), and therefore becomi ng more attractive to users on the first side (drivers), 
can result in a positive growth spiral and a “winner-takes-all” or  “winner-takes-most” 
outcome, where all market participants want to be on the same platform. There is the 
risk that a platform that builds a dominant  market position woul d extract rents from 
its massive data and networks (Croxson et  al 2021). The multi-sided nature of the 
market, however, makes it difficult to define  the relevant market interactions, such as 
product tying, for competition analysis . Furthermore, multi-sided markets are 
characterized by complex pricing structures , including asymmetric pricing that more 
finely divides the consumer surplus amongst participants. Pricing practices that could 
be considered anti-competit ive in one-sided markets migh t be pro-competitive in a 
multi-sided market by attracting more part icipants and increasi ng welfare-enhancing 
network effects (White et al 2018). The imp lications of these aspects for financial Investment in CloudTech and DevOps companies1 Graph 4

Impact on transaction costs, informa tion asymmetries, and market gaps 
Through the advances in connectivity and computing, digital i nnovation helps to 
alleviate transaction costs and enable a wide range of new financial services business 
models. Adoption cuts across traditional an d new providers. Digital technologies can 
help reduce the costs of collecting, storin g, processing, and ex changing information 
– including search costs, replication costs,  tracking costs, and verification costs 
(Goldfarb and Tucker 2019). In  finance, this can help borrowers to more quickly find 
a suitable offer on a loan, or help savers to find an investment product that suits their specific needs. Technologies can also help parties to automate verification of events, 
enabling the creation of a wider range of state-contingent produc ts. For instance, an 
insurance client may use a phone camera or other remote device to document 
damage that results in an insurance claim, or  a drone may verify that a field has been 
planted to enable disbursement of an agricu ltural loan. Blockchain technologies take 
these a level further by providing a set of underlying capabilities making it easier for 
individuals and businesses to interact on a peer-to-peer basis even when they do not 
know each other beforehand (trustless context). At the limit, such advances may 
obviate the need for intermediation, by enab ling individuals or firms – such as the 
lenders and borrowers in P2P and private credit markets – to  interact directly without 
the need for a bank to aggregate fund s, assess credit, and provide ongoing 
monitoring and servicing functions.  
Incumbents, fintech entrants, and big tech s are leveraging technology to address 
economic frictions. They can close info rmation gaps (asymm etric information, 
uncertainty), and cut costs by:  
• Reducing information asymmetries. Cla ssic theories of intermediation describe 
how banks address information asymme tries between borrowers and lenders 
(Aghion and Bolton 1997; Holmström and Tirole 1997). They also discuss how 
residual gaps increase credit  costs or restrict the supply of credit, both in terms 
of interest rates and the costs of ancillary activities such as attaching collateral. 
Better information, for example leveragi ng consumer data and analytics, could 
improve risk assessment and reduce the need for collateral as  an indicator of 
creditworthiness in lending (Gambacorta et al 2020; see Box A). The use of vast 
troves of data enables the provision of financial services to individuals and small 
businesses with no or limited traditional credit history, promoting financial inclusion. More information and greater transparency tend to increase trust, 
enabling providers and users of fund s to work with a wider range of 
counterparties. With enough transpar ency between users of finance and 
providers of funds, intermediation itse lf may not be necessary. For example, 
fintech credit models such as P2P or mark etplace lending seek  to directly link 
investors and borrowers (Claessens et al 2018).

 • Enabling customization of financial servic es to construct more complete markets. 
Data and automation facilitate the execution and monitoring of complex 
contracts and creation of more complete  markets. This could bring financial 
services closer to the stylized general equilibrium of the classic Arrow-Debreu 
(1954) model. Traditional core banking systems and marketing channels were 
built around standardized products, and did not facilitate a fully consumer-
centric approach to product development and marketing. More tailored services, 
such as loans, investment advice, or retirement planning structured to take 
account of the individual circumstan ces of the borrower across different 
outcomes and states of the world, requir ed highly trained and expensive experts. 
In contrast, fintech-enabl ed automation of processes reduces the set-up costs 
for customized products and can track different contingencies across a wide 
range of outcomes. Digital marketing syst ems enable specialized products to find 
a sufficient customer base. The increased availability of data and computing 
power makes it possible to better price risk, tailor a product or service to the 
needs of the consumer, and potentially construct a range of  state-contingent 
products, executed and monitored throug h smart contracts or other emerging 
technologies. 
• Reducing fixed and marginal costs of pr oducing financial services. Technology 
has reduced the costs of, and need for, much of th e traditional physical 
infrastructure that drove fixed costs for th e direct financial services provider. An 
early example that has been particularly important in EMDEs is mobile money. Mobile money has reduced the need for tr aditional bank branches and payments 
acceptance infrastructure, eg point of sale (POS) terminals, and has become a 
widely used alternative to bank accounts in some countries. Cloud-based 
infrastructure, including Banking-as-a -Service (BaaS), provides computing 
power, data storage, and even complianc e services. A niche financial services 
provider can connect to these services and purchase as much capacity as it 
requires on demand without the need to build data ce ntres and other back-office 
infrastructure (or, in the case of BaaS, a license).
7 Financial intermediaries can 
reduce marginal costs through techno logy-enabled automation and “straight-
through” processing, which are accelerating with the expanded use of data and 
AI-based processes. Digital innovation can also help to overcome spatial 
(geographical) barriers, and even to brid ge differences across legal jurisdictions 
(akin to processes discussed by Bodie and Merton 2005). The increased use of 
digital tools and platforms for a range of economic activities makes it possible 
to embed tailored financial products into non-financial activities, drastically 
reducing customer acquisition costs and risks. Contextualized finance will be 
discussed further below.   
 
7  While branch fixed costs may be eliminated by direct connectivity to customers, technology fixed 
cost has been variabilized at the level of the financ ial services provider but remains a high fixed cost 
offering from the technology provider(s). The rele vant market for tech infrastructure shifts from 
financial services to IT/cloud serv ices. The resulting market concentration issues are addressed below.

 • Reducing search and switch ing costs for consumers. Ad vances in connectivity 
and online search mean finding and using a financial services provider in the next 
state or province – or across the globe – can be as easy as finding one in the Box A 
Data and collateral 
Banks usually require borrowers to pledge tangible assets, su ch as real estate, to help offset asymmetric information 
problems. Collateral performs several func tions: it can indicate creditworthiness, to the extent that having accumulated 
the means to possess a tangible asset signals something abou t ability to repay a loan; it provides an alternative means 
to recover the loan in case the borrower becomes unable to repay; and it aligns interests because the potential loss 
of the collateral would be costly for a borrower who become s unwilling to repay. By contrast, big techs can use big 
data to better assess firms’ creditworthi ness. They can link repayment performanc e to other sources of value, such as 
access to new inventory or to an e-commerce platform to sell goods. These capabilities could help to reduce the 
importance of collateral in solving asymmetric information problems and maintaining alignment of interests. 
Gambacorta et al (2020) compare how credit from a big tech firm (Ant Group) and traditional bank lending 
correlate with local economic activity, house prices, and firm-specific characteri stics. Using a unique random sample 
of more than 2 million Chinese firms, the paper finds that big tech credit does not correlate with local business 
conditions and house prices when controlling for demand factors. 
Graph A1 indicates the unconditional elas ticity between the differe nt credit forms and house price. The dots in 
the figures indicate the average logarith m credit use (y-axis) and the average logarithm of housing price (x-axis) at 
the city-year level. The left-hand panel plots big tech cred it, the middle panel plots bank secured credit (mortgages) 
and the right-hand panel plots bank unsec ured credit. Linear trend lines are repo rted in each graph, together with

of unsecured bank credit is twice as high (0.184). That of se cured bank credit is five time s higher (0.488). A greater use 
of big tech credit could therefore have macroeconomic imp lications, weakening the relevanc e of the collateral channel.

 same city. On the consumer side, the marg inal cost of using multiple financial 
service providers is also reduced. Techno logies have become increasingly plug-
and-play, from the advent of common internet communications protocols and 
mark-up languages, to “open banking” and standardized APIs that facilitate data 
access and exchange. Increased access to  information about remote providers 
and their products and pric es reduces search costs fo r users. The reduction in 
search and switching costs thus applie s both to providers and individual 
customers. For example, a customer can now choose a start-up remittance 
service provider offering lower fees an d ready connectivity to the customer’s 
bank account, or an established soci al media company that already has the 
customer’s trust and connectivity to friends and family to whom remittances are 
sent. Reduced search costs could eventu ally enable those who need finance to 
connect directly to those wi th excess funds to invest, with smart loan contracts 
replacing the monitoring prov ided by intermediaries. Lo wer search, on-boarding, 
and switching costs could make  markets more competitive.  
Despite reduced costs, incr eased efficiency, and all th e new data and computing 
power available, fintech remains subject to  the same risks traditionally present in 
finance. Credit, liquidity, market, and operat ional risks can be reduced or transferred, 
but not eliminated completely. Market failures can result in financial instability, speculative bubbles, domino effects and, po tentially, systemic risks (Frost 2020). In 
most markets digital finance has not reached levels at which it presents systemic risk, 
but as fintech and big tech finance grow, and traditional banks use similar technologies to a greater degree, that will shift. P2P lending in China reached 
significant volumes before the regulatory crackdown began in 2017. This culminated 
in the November 2019 requirement that all platforms close or convert to regulated 
small loan providers within two years. P2P lending in China and the more recent Wirecard failure in Germany offer lessons on  the need for approp riate regulation and 
supervision of fintech. Big tech firms may already have reached the level of systemic 
importance (too-big-to-fail) in some econ omies, notably in China. Authorities are 
actively formulating appropriate regulatory  responses to these risks (see Section 4). 
The digital transformation of  finance also introduces – or heightens – cyber risks. 
Cybersecurity is an issue for all sectors and for traditional financial services providers 
as well as fintechs and big techs. The attack surface is broadening, however, as 
interconnectivity increases an d the disaggregation of serv ices introduces more links 
to each product chain and user interface. These factors can also increase operational 
risks as a greater number of distinct enti ties may be involved in the provision of a 
single product or service, creating comp lex webs of operational dependency. These 
risks may have increased further during the COVID-19 pandemic (Aldasoro et al 
2021). At the same time, certain core services have become more concentrated (eg 
provision of cloud services), creating the po tential that single points of failure could 
result in systemic disruption.  
Finally, there are new risks to privacy an d consumer protection . The proliferation 
of providers and tailored services, reachi ng new customers and embedding financial 
products into other activities, increase th e risks of compromising privacy, abusive 
practices or errors by unaware consumers.  Consumer protection and regulation of 
risks arising from fintech and digital transfor mation are addressed in other papers in 
the forthcoming Future  of Finance series.

 2.2 Consequences for financial services firms 
The financial services value chain consis ts of four broad components: customer 
interface, back-office function s, infrastructure, and balanc e sheet. The operations that 
‘manufacture’ financial services involve the fi rst three of these. Th e theory of the firm 
in economics highlights transactions costs as a key determinant of whether a given process or interaction will be mediated thro ugh the market or within a firm (Coase 
1937; Williamson 1971). Prior to the advent of fintech, the combination of transactions 
costs and economies of scale and scope resu lted in large financial intermediaries that 
tended to be vertically and horizontally integrated, providing all four components 
(and multitudes of subcomponents) internally. 
i. Customer interface. This consists of ph ysical networks such as branches, ATMs, 
and points-of-sale to distribute core financial products and services. In the past, 
customers needed to be physic ally present to co nduct activities such as opening 
an account, buying a product, making a transaction, and getting advice. In many cases, these activities were paper-bas ed and cumbersome. Al though the advent 
of the internet gave rise to online and mobile banking, these were again owned 
and operated by a particular financial institution. As a result, financial institutions largely remained as gatekeepers  to the consumer with a basic bank account being 
the pre-condition to participate in the economy and acquire additional financial 
services. As a result, financial institutions were also able to tap into a highly regulated, but sticky and cheap source of funding: retail deposits. 
ii. Back and middle office. This consists  of all the departments, processes, and 
internal systems to operate the bank’s  products and balance sheets. These 
functions include risk management, r egulatory compliance, credit decisions, 
fraud detection, call centres, trade re conciliation, technology operations, and 
record keeping. Prior to the advent of fintech, these processes involved manual 
and paper-based intervention and requ ired cross-departmental coordination. 
Organizational complexity and siloed legacy IT systems further increased 
transaction costs, left customer data unexploit ed, impeded the ability to 
innovate, and degraded customer experiences. 
iii. Infrastructure. This connects individual financial sector participants (including the 
central bank) to collectively comprise the financial system. This includes payment 
and settlement systems (r etail and wholesale) as well as other financial 
infrastructures such as credit inform ation bureaus and ar rangements that 
facilitate transactions across cross-border s. Many of these infrastructures still 
face inefficiencies due to, for ex ample, limited operating hours and 
interoperability constraints. Further, unt il recently, non-banks typically could not 
access these infrastructures directly an d were therefore reliant on banks. 
iv. Balance sheet. Deploying customer deposits (or other sources of funds) into 
productive loans (and other uses of funds) through balance sheet intermediation 
is one of the oldest functions in financ e. A modern balance sheet serves more 
complex functions and is optimized to attr act a mix of retail and wholesale funds, 
to match assets and liabilities across multiple dimensions (tenor, currency, etc.) 
and to maintain adequate capital and liqui dity levels. Balance sheets of regulated 
financial institutions are subject to a va riety of requirements and constraints. 
Certain types of financial institutions – eg payment service providers, mutual fund 
managers, and more recently P2P or marketplace lenders – do not create 
customer liabilities and assets on their own balance sheets. Nevertheless, balance  
 
14 BIS Papers No 117
 sheet finance remains dominant in most EMDEs. Even in advanced economies, 
assets that are ultimately  funded through capital ma rkets are often originated 
on-balance sheet before being securiti zed or sold to a ‘shadow bank.’  
As technology has reduced transaction costs, the boundaries of the firm have 
changed and the production ch ain for financial services could be more disaggregated 
(vertical disintegration). This has been taki ng place for decades; an  example is the use 
of third-party ATM and card networks to process bankin g withdrawals or payments 
transactions. First, the ATM moved the tr ansaction outside the bank branch. Then, 
connectivity and information transfer tech nologies enabled different companies to 
provide elements of the tr ansaction value chain – an issuing bank, a merchant 
processor operating a POS terminal, and a network operator. As a result, the 
customer-facing bank could focus on its core competencies and customers. With 
advances in technology, this process has acce lerated. There is an increasing array of 
products and services that can be sourced from multiple different providers, 
combined, and offered to the customer as an integrated whole. The customer-facing 
provider might incorporate features and func tions from external vendors, outsourcing 
providers, or partners. Examples include us ing third-party sales agents or internet 
marketplace originators, external credit scoring services, outs ourced card issuer 
processing, and white-label integration of fintech services.  
Advances in information and connectivity have also led to an unbundling of 
financial services consumption (horizontal disintegration). Customers now have more 
information about different providers and an increased ability to interact across 
providers, so they can choose  different providers for the different financial products 
they use. Similarly, providers have more access to information about new or potential 
customers, can market to them better, and ca n offer services directly. The availability 
of data also makes it easier for provider s to underwrite a cust omer without having 
had a prior relationship, so the inherent competitive advantage of a single provider 
in offering additional products is diminish ed. Services that were once consumed from 
one financial institution can be offered by a wide range of specialized firms. Examples 
in both personal and busi ness banking underscore th is unbundling (Graph 5). 
However, even as the consumer’s need for a horizontally  integrated provider has been 
reduced, providers can now integrate more products from different providers. The 
outcome in terms of horizontal disintegra tion depends on individual preferences, 
views on convenience, and cost s to search and assemble product sets. All of these are 
affected by changing access modes, eg from bran ch to internet, agent, or mobile app.

 Consumer interfaces are changing from ph ysical branches to convenient digital 
access from anywhere. Digital consumer in terfaces (eg web, mobile) enable new 
players to directly reach consumers both ne ar and far. By using apps from different 
competitors, consumers can build their own complete bank and gain more personalized services. This has likely reduc ed the value of legacy physical networks 
and the incumbent’s grip on the customer, who can easily  shift funds to different 
providers to access preferred services (Shev lin 2019). For example, the innovation of 
mobile money was a network- based account ledger provided by non-bank players 
and mobile network operators, leveragi ng already-ubiquitous mobile network 
connectivity infrastructure. This was co mbined with a new ecosystem of low-cost 
agents for the custome r interface, and a high degree of  automation to eliminate most 
back-office processes. Mobile money ecos ystems deliver low value/high volume 
transactions cost effectively, making this a viable offering for low income inclusive 
finance segments. Similarly, fintech payment aggregators ( eg Square and Stripe) offer 
convenient payment services to merchant s without the need for them to set up a 
merchant account with a processing bank. The aggregators act as the ‘merchant of record’ taking responsibility for compliance vis-à-vis network and bank requirements. 
A related development is th at the customer interface co uld be with institutions 
outside the jurisdictional boundaries of th e customer. On the internet, it does not 
matter to the consumer if the provider is in Kansas or Kathmandu (although it may matter to the regulator!) Servic es have adapted accordingly.  
Non-financial companies can also levera ge customer connectiv ity and data to 
offer financial services, altering the competitive landscape and blurring industry 
boundaries. As mobile applications and th e internet have become a dominant way 
through which consumers live their live s and businesses operate, e-commerce, 
telecom, online search, logistics/transpor tation, and social media platforms have 
become the new gatekeepers to the custome r. Digital platforms and big techs in 
particular are well placed to directly tap in to their vast customer  networks and data 
(BIS 2019). They are able to offer contextually  relevant financial services to their user 
bases to enhance the customer’s experience or increase sales of their core product. 
For example, e-commerce, ride-hailing, and social media platform s have integrated 
seamless payment services to strengthen the value proposition in their core markets. 
Micro-insurance has been embedded into mob ile money and the sale of consumer 
products. Users do not desire most financial services in and of themselves, but see 
them as a means to another activity (eg pa y a driver to reach a destination, take out 
a working capital loan to obtain inventory) . As such, embedding the financial service 
directly into that core activity can be attractive to the customer. It can even make the 
customer more aware of services about which they otherwise might not have known, or to which they might not have had access. Banks have used customer relationships 
to cross-sell financial services since the beginning of banking; now an increasing 
range of non-bank actors ar e doing the same thing.  
The back and middle office are bein g revamped – or eliminated entirely. 
Technology has reduced the costs of, and need for, much  of the traditional back-
office infrastructure, from pa per processing to data centres. The back office is being 
revamped to lower costs and improve communication. Process automation and 
upgrades to software and IT systems are causing a re structuring of financial 
institutions and a reduction of full-time employees. Middle-office functions such as 
reconciliations are increasingly unnecessary. Entire processes, and many of the skills 
that previously had to be hired, can be re placed with automation or expert systems. 
This has also given room for third parties to step in, such as cloud service providers  
 
16 BIS Papers No 117
 and fintechs with specialized capabilities th at sell their software-as-a-service (SaaS) 
to banks (eg data processing, credit scorin g, electronic know-your-customer (e-KYC)). 
For example, a bank can work with a credit-scoring company that leverages unique 
data and scoring expertise to prov ide a seamless customer experience.  
Unencumbered by legacy systems, some new entrants have built new software 
platforms to handle their core banking activities, while others rent. Cloud-based 
infrastructure and BaaS providers allow smaller banks to outsource technology 
operations and leverage the latest systems to compete alongside larger banks. They 
enable small start-ups to purchase not only  data processing and storage capacity, but 
also entry points into regulated infrastructure and regulatory compliance. Thus, smaller players can grow capacity in tan dem with their custom er base, without the 
initial setup costs and step function cost curves previously required.  
Technology has also accelerated the intern ationalization of back-office functions. 
For several decades there has been a trend of  offshoring back-office functions. Many 
financial firms first shifted call centre s and customer service to lower-cost 
environments; they later shif ted application processing an d IT operations. This trend 
is accelerated by the advent of cloud comp uting. Entire IT systems, including core 
banking systems, can now be hosted anywhere in the world. In regions with common 
regulatory frameworks, even th e entire provision of some products and services could 
be outside the boundaries of  the customer’s co untry. For example, a digital bank 
domiciled in Lithuania can bundle produc ts and services from elsewhere in the 
European Union (EU) and offer them to cu stomers over the enti re EU. On the other 
hand, in jurisdictions where the use of cl oud-based infrastructure and/or overseas 
data processing and storage ha ve been restricted (due to  data localization or other 
policies), efficiencies and entry may be limited. This is particularly true if the market is 
too small to support its own localized infrastr ucture. The shift of back-office functions 
– and associated processes and customer data – to other jurisdictions can raise a new 
set of supervisory challenges.  
Supporting infrastructures are changing. Much of the traditional infrastructure, 
which was both a cost and source of comp etitive advantage for incumbents, can be 
reduced or replaced, or must be shared. Digi tal identity (ID) and know your customer 
(KYC) registries are implemented in ma ny countries and ca n help redefine the 
onboarding and authentication process that  has long required in -person verification 
at a branch (D’Silva et al 2019). New infrastructures such as API platforms for 
payments or lending, and distributed ledger  systems that can support crypto-assets 
or stablecoins, could produce large networ k effects and change the role of, or even 
disintermediate, certain players (Arner et  al 2020). Open banking initiatives require 
banks to share customer data with fintechs. In some jurisdictions banks must initiate 
transactions introduced by fintechs upon  customer request, further eroding the 
traditional incumbent-customer relationship. At the same time, public payment 
system innovations have allowed access to non-banks. On the one hand, open banking APIs enable non-banks to offer pa yment initiation services, without them 
having to participate in any of the paym ent systems themselves . On the other hand 
central banks are requiring transparent an d risk-based access criteria for payment 
and settlement systems, replacing earlier restrictions of access to only banks.

 3. Implications for the industrial organization of the 
financial sector 
3.1 Implications for market entry 
Digital innovation has reduced cost barrie rs, allowing new and smaller players to 
enter. The elimination of many fixed costs and a reduction in variable and switching 
costs makes it possible for low-cost provi ders to enter the market, subject to local 
regulation. Although a trusted reputation must still be developed, small providers are 
more likely than in the past to be economic ally viable. Such new providers may strip 
away particular customer segm ents and revenue bases from traditional providers, or 
broaden access to finance fo r previously underserved segm ents, without needing to 
achieve large scale and scope. Apps an d cloud-based computing and software 
platforms have enabled entrepreneurs to qu ickly bootstrap withou t the need to raise 
huge amounts of capital to finance massive upfront investments. APIs and open 
banking initiatives have the potential to further accelerate this trend, since a new 
service need not wrench the cu stomer completely away fr om the incumbent, and can 
therefore build trust by layering a service on  top of the safety net provided by legacy 
institutions.  
Infrastructure connectivit y and a reduced need for ph ysical branches allow 
established companies from other sectors to  offer financial services as well. These 
entrants can deploy automated processes in  lieu of hiring a specialized workforce, 
connect to the financial transactions infrastructure, and leverage cloud-based 
infrastructures to reduce the cost of cross-market entry. For many of these new 
providers, such as digital platform comp anies and some telecoms, consumer trust 
and a customer base are already establish ed in their core markets and potentially 
transferable to the financial sector (Oliver  Wyman 2019). Some are able to combine 
financial services with other products or core capabilities as part of a platform 
offering. This is particularly relevant in  EMDEs where the financial system is less 
developed and access to financial services is  more limited. This affords fintechs and 
big techs more room to expand their financia l activities and compete with incumbents 
(FSB 2020). 
Entry into financial services is accele rated by the ability to turn regulatory 
compliance into a technology integration process. Several banks have built BaaS 
platforms to serve fintechs and even other banks. They can connect these clients to 
the payment system or a bank balance sheet, thus reducing the need to deal with the 
complexities of licensing, regulation, and developing their own co re banking systems. 
Leveraging BaaS, new entrants can tap into existing – and already regulated – financial 
transactions and balance sheet providers. Wh ere open banking is in force, they can 
also leverage the data, and sometimes functionality, of existing financial accounts. 
This allows a wider range of use cases into which finance can be embedded; in 
particular, a range of commercial platforms or transactional situations can layer on a financial service from a BaaS provider without much of the systems and compliance 
overhead previously required. While increasing competition, this multi-faceted and 
multi-tiered access to the r egulated banking sector intr oduces new challenges for 
regulators and supervisors,  as discussed below.   
 
18 BIS Papers No 117
 3.2 Shifting economies of scale and scope 
However, basic economic forces remain relevant. Economies of scale and scope 
remain, even as the minimum efficient sc ale for service delivery is lower for the 
individual user and for most financial services providers. That has been accomplished 
in part by shifting the scale effects to the infrastructure pr oviders; scale remains highly 
relevant in areas of cloud c omputing and data processing and software platforms. In 
fact, new forms of scale have emerged in connectivity and comp uting, along with 
previously present economies of scale in capital, including reputation, or ”trust 
capital.”  
In the digital finance era, economic fric tions have not disappeared, but take on 
new forms. The costs of services have been  reduced in many cases, but certainly not 
eliminated. Financial services providers, part icularly new non-bank providers, face two 
important costs in the unbundled marketplace: 
• Customer acquisition costs.  Customer acquisition costs, comprising marketing, 
onboarding, KYC, and initial credit assessment, remain significant relative to 
revenues, especially for retail financial serv ices. This is partly due to regulatory 
requirements, but marketing and other onboarding costs remain pertinent even 
when remote interactions are possible ( eg leveraging e-KYC). While technology 
has made it easy to directly reach us ers digitally, the cost to acquire new 
customers remains high because of user inertia, which is particularly present in retail and SME business lines. Customer acquisition costs are also significant for 
wholesale customers, as sy stems integration and busi ness process changes may 
be cumbersome, and initial credit assessment is more complex. Amortizing these and other fixed costs across more custom ers and products allows for economies 
of scale and scope. This naturally puts larger incumbents an d big techs at an 
advantage.  
• Funding costs.  As noted above, some products have natural complementarities 
that reduce the cost of pr oviding one or the other prod uct if offered in tandem. 
Most clearly, offering loans is more economical if there is a cheap source of 
funding in the form of deposits. There are other complementarities in derivatives, stock lending, insurance, etc. Size, and th e diversification it brings, can provide a 
funding advantage due to lower risk, an d greater liquidity of traded funding 
instruments (bonds, shares) issued at scal e. In general, big tech firms have a 
higher overall cost of fu nding than global systemically important financial 
institutions (G-SIFIs) because they use more equity and have no deposits. 
However, when analysing similar funding components (ie bonds) big techs tend 
to have a lower cost at issuance (Graph 6). 
   
 
BIS Papers No 117 19
 Consumers and other users also experience frictions in the unbundled financial 
services marketplace. As consumers balance choice and convenienc e, they may favour 
firms offering broader scope: 
• Assembly costs.  Simplicity and convenience have significant value, often resulting 
in preferences for a single provider that  offers an integrated suite of financial 
products and services, even if each indi vidual product may be less convenient or 
well-designed, or marginally more expens ive, than those of alternative niche 
providers. For many consumer s, there is a cost to the time, effort, and potential 
confusion of assembling fragmented se rvices from unbundled providers and 
moving funds between them. Thus, most savers still use intermediaries or platforms to deploy their savings instead of searching out in dividual borrowers. 
Similarly, “contextualized finance” embeds  the financial service into the actual 
economic activity the custom er is seeking to perform (eg pay for a trip on a hail 
riding platform, take out a loan on an e-commerce platform). This can provide 
the service that is needed exactly when it is needed. Wher e the customer is 
already using a platform provider or big tech, onboarding costs are reduced, and 
convenience for the user creates economie s of scope for the provider. The rise 
of “super apps” such as WeChat, AliPay , Yandex, and Grab, and contenders such 
as Rappi and Revolut which add multiple services, is testament to the value consumers place on being able to go to a single source for multiple services.  
• Switching costs.  For consumers, business users and financial services providers 
considering a change of vendor , there are barriers in the form of effort, inertia, 
inconvenience, and the difficulty of disentangling a service that has been linked Average spread of active bonds to be nchmark government bonds at issuance

 to multiple activities and systems. Switch ing costs can also result from intentional 
technical design. Consumers may flock to digital platforms wi th large customer 
bases to benefit from network effects. Ye t once they become large, platforms 
may seek to increase switching costs. If a service has been integrated into 
multiple activities or workflows, or has accumulated significan t user data, it may 
also able to provide better or more tailo red services that a new provider would 
not be able to match. Where proprietary protocols are in place, or historical data are difficult to share, conne ctivity across different prov iders might be hindered.  
3.3 Impact on financial services providers 
Reduced economic frictions, the ability to reconfigure the value chain, new 
opportunities for entry, and shifting economies of scale and scope will affect different financial services providers differently. The impact will depend on their current market 
positions and ability to leverage technology . Incumbents start with advantages in 
trust capital and regulatory position. Fintec hs are proving nimble at leveraging data, 
connectivity, and improved processing capaci ty, and at converting regulatory barriers 
into solvable technology challenges. Big te chs compound the adva ntages of fintechs 
with large scale existing customer bases for non-financial business lines, associated customer data, and high levels of brand trust (Stulz 2020; OECD 2020).
8 Individuals 
play a limited role as financial service providers today, interacting largely via 
intermediaries. In a future of increased connectivity and decentralized finance, 
individuals may be further empowered as di rect providers of financial services.  
Incumbents 
Although there is increasing competition,  the continued relevance of basic economic 
forces enables incumbent financial institutions with integrated product offerings to maintain – at least for now – significant ma rket share. Incumbents  have an advantage 
in having already overcome some of the information asymmetries that form a barrier 
to trust: they are regulated and have b een in the market an d demonstrated their 
reliability over time. Multi-product incumb ents ameliorate cust omer switching and 
assembly costs. Incumbents benefit from ec onomies of scale in financial capital, and 
the diversification benefits inherent in la rger scale and broader scope. Incumbents 
also have economies of scal e in customer data, which they are beginning to better 
leverage, and customers often have higher tr ust in incumbents to safeguard their data 
(Armantier et al 2021).  
Unbundling could reduce the cross-subsidies that are i nherent in the integrated 
banking model. Free use of a current acco unt is often funded by the use of the 
balances to lend to other customers, or by the value created in providing other 
products to the account holder. While pr oduct tying is often considered an anti-
competitive practice, in most markets traditional banking products have explicit 
exemption from anti-tying rules (see, eg OCC 1995). Disaggregation can disrupt this 
business model, potentially stripping away th e more profitable products and services 
that have stand-alone profitability (eg remittances), and leaving traditional providers 
 
8  Surveys of the most trusted consumer brands globally and in the US continue to place big techs well 
above financial institutions. See Morning Consult (2021). On the other hand, Arma ntier et al. (2021) 
find that US consumers trust big techs the least to safeguard their personal data, and have more trust 
in banks, followed by fintechs and the government . The difference may be explained in part by the 
difference in overall brand trust versus trust to safeguard personal data.

 with an embedded cost base and products with low margins or  that the market 
expects to get for free. Open banking regu lations that require banks to offer access 
to their customers’ accounts coul d accelerate this process.  
Incumbents are innovating and upgradin g across each component of the value 
chain. Indeed, a recent World Bank survey finds that digital transformation is a 
strategic priority for the overwhelming ma jority of incumbents. They aim to shed 
overhead costs and employees, improve pr oducts, and compete for the consumer 
relationship (Feyen et al 2021). Many expect further growth in digital customer 
interactions and transactions, which will inte nsify competition. The largest institutions 
can leverage their scale, customer base, regu latory expertise, and capacity to update 
their technology stacks and manage large balance sheets in order to effectively 
compete with big tech entrants. Smaller institutions can take advantage of on-
demand infrastructure and exte rnal service providers to undertake a rapid and less 
costly digital transformation. Incumbents that  are not able to adapt in time may perish 
or be acquired. 
Some incumbents have built distribution  platforms to enrich their own product 
offering by allowing fintechs to offer their products directly to the incumbent’s users. 
In essence, these incumbents have be come marketplaces and leverage network 
effects.9 Innovations in infrastructure such as  APIs can facilitate these partnerships, 
which benefit from both the fintechs’ need to achieve scale, and banks’ continued 
centrality in the financial services relati onship for many customers. As long as 
customers remain tethered to bank accounts directly or through fintechs, banks can continue to benefit from their own economies  of scale in capital, connectivity, and 
high-fidelity consumer financial data.  
Banks continue to have deep expertise in regulation and compliance and have 
already passed key regulatory hurdles ahead of new entrants. Many  fintechs and big 
techs offer their financial services in close direct or indirect collaboration with banks 
to access the regulated financia l system at the back  office or infrastructure layers. B2B 
fintechs and big techs offer th eir services to incumbents in the form of partnerships 
or SaaS engagements. This is  also the main level where banks engage with big techs 
to procure state-of-the-art cloud comput ing and data processing services which 
require deep expertise and economies of sc ale. Business-to-consumer (B2C) fintechs 
and big techs that compete directly at the customer interface level often still rely on 
banks themselves to store va lue (eg the so-called float, or deposited funds, of mobile 
money operators). They also use banks to access the payment system, or use other 
core banking system functions that are difficult to build in-house (eg by using BaaS). 
Moreover, depending on the regulatory en vironment and the business model choices 
fintechs make, their customers often need to have an accoun t with a financial 
institution to use the fintechs’ services, driving continued deman d for at least some 
incumbents’ services. 
Incumbents also have a comparative ad vantage in managing complex, large 
balance sheets and navigating compliance with evolving regulations. This is critical 
since finance is one of the mos t highly regulated sectors. As such, many fintechs and 
big techs may be reluctant to become full-fledged regulat ed financial institutions, 
which can be a slow, costly, and uncertain process. However, regtech solutions could 
erode part of this comparative advanta ge of incumbents (Auer 2019). As another

 example, lending platforms al so rely on incumbents and institutional investors to 
purchase the loans originated on the platform.  
The main challenge for incumbents is that they are encu mbered by legacy 
systems, networks, and cultures; not all w ill be able to adapt and survive. Legacy, 
fixed-cost infrastructure cannot be easily scaled back at the same rate as it becomes 
obsolete. Financial institutions (and regu lators) are also mindful of the need to 
maintain minimum services for non-digitiz ed customer segments, especially in more 
remote locations where altern atives are limited. Incumben ts bear regulatory and 
compliance requirements that  may not apply to new competitors or that can be 
evaded via regulatory arbitrage. Incumbents  may also have service obligations not 
imposed on fintech or big tech players. Th ese regulatory and social obligations can 
present competitive disadvanta ges if steps are not taken to level the playing field.  
Fintechs 
After driving the unbundling of financial se rvices, many fintechs have begun to re-
bundle. Fintechs have been adding new products to their offerings, by themselves or 
via partnerships and platform approaches. Th is allows them to cr oss-sell to existing 
customers and make themselves more attr active to new ones. Some examples are 
shown in Graph 7. For some, this has been the result of opportunities to provide a 
better customer experience and increase reve nue. For others, it has been a matter of 
necessity. Since scale and scope economies still matter, fintechs that focused on a 
limited range of products may not be able to achieve funding synergies or amortize 
customer acquisition costs, regulatory compliance costs, and investments in brand 
recognition across a sufficiently large revenue base to be able to generate profits or 
fully compete on price with incumbents. It will be interesting to observe how these 
newly re-bundled product sets evolve. Newer companies building up a set of services 
for a particular customer base in today’s environment, leveraging high quality-data 
on market needs and customer profitability, will doubtless arrive at a different product 
set than was developed by uni versal banks through agglomeration of products over 
a long period, from the 18th to the 20th centuries.  
New entrants initially stayed away from financial activities that carry large 
licensing, capital and regulatory burdens. Mo st new players focused on activities such 
as payments, cards and financial advice , and avoided highly regulated, capital 
intensive activities such as on-balance sheet lending and secu rities underwriting. 
Indeed, the rapid rise of fintechs was facilit ated in many markets by regulatory gaps 
that allowed new service providers to en ter and operate with minimal regulatory 
burden. As regulators caught up, fintech stra tegies shifted; in so me markets they were 
forced to seek licenses.  
Some fintechs have chosen a regulated status as part of their evolving product 
strategies. For example, alte rnative finance platforms initially focused on matching 
supply and demand of capital, avoiding th e regulatory burden of intermediation. 
However, in the process of re-bundling, some fintechs have sought full banking 
licenses. In particular, lending platforms have faced challenges to fund their operations in wholesale markets or using a pure P2P funding model. As a result, they 
have become more reliant on incumbents for funding, or have sought their own 
banking licenses. For example, Grab and SoFi have sought banking licenses, while GoJek and MoneyTap partner with banks (the latter also has a non-bank financial 
company license). Other fintechs prefer to  avoid a higher regulatory burden by 
expanding across borders to reach scale wi th their existing product offering. The  
 
BIS Papers No 117 23
 COVID-19 pandemic and resu lting economic dislocatio ns have exacerbated the 
challenges of relying on crow dfunding, capital markets, or bank partners for balance 
sheet capacity. As a result, two prominent early fintech le nders, OnDeck and Kabbage, 
were sold to other companies in July and August 2020.  
Big techs 
Basic economic forces such as  scale and scope economies, along with network effects, 
also play to the fundamental strengths of big tech companies. Big techs already enjoy 
an active customer base, cr eating economies of scale an d scope and network effects 
in their core markets; they are increasing ly able to leverage these to exert market 
power in the financial sector (BIS 2 019; Frost et al 2019). Agility in systems 
development and creating easy-to-use custom er interfaces are relative strengths of 
tech companies compared to traditional fina ncial institutions, and big techs’ access 
to customer data and understanding of customer behaviours may equal or exceed 
those of financial institutions. Big techs can bundle financial services to reinforce the value proposition of the ecosystem in thei r core markets, such as e-commerce and 
social media, or offer financial services as a new product line cross-sold to the existing 
customer base. This phenom enon is manifest in devel oped and emerging markets, 
often led by the latter. Alibaba was a leader  in layering payments onto e-commerce 
with AliPay. It then developed a broad range of financial services. (By contrast, eBay’s 
integration of the original incarnation of Pa yPal did not go as fa r). Marketplaces from 
Amazon to Gojek, Grab, Jumia, Lazada, an d Mercado Libre are integrating merchant 
loans into their offerings. Because financ ial services are layered over other cash 
generating activities, these companies can subsidize the financial services. For 
instance, WeChat Pay, WhatsApp Pay and other providers allow users to send money 
to each other for free – though fees may be  higher for merchants and business users. 
In some cases, the value a big tech can gene rate from customer data by driving traffic 
to its core business may be higher th an the financial service fee income.  Fintech product offerings have expanded over time Graph 7
 
 
24 BIS Papers No 117
 Big techs have already amass ed vast troves of relevant alternative customer data 
which traditional financial institutions lack. Combined with their ability to process 
these data for insights, this has enabled bi g techs to offer tailored financial services 
such as insurance or work ing capital loans to merchants on their platforms who 
traditionally lack collateral or strong credit  histories. This has uprooted the notion of 
traditional “relationship banking” in which banks have superior proprietary hard and 
soft information about their clients thus keeping them captive. Big techs also often choose to partner with incumbent financial in stitutions to offer these services so they 
can focus on their core markets. Regardless,  bundling of services sets in motion a 
feedback loop, ie the data-net work-activities (DNA) loop (see Box B) where big tech 
ecosystems become more valuable to user s. This begets new users, higher user 
engagement, and more user data. This in turn boosts network effects and economies 
of scale and scope, which enable big techs to increase the value of their ecosystems. 
Big techs can leverage unique market powe r in providing contextual finance – 
the bundling of financial services with core activities. In addition  to the data-network-
activity feedback loop described above, “contextualized financ e” may result in 
improved operational efficien cy and portfolio performance relative to traditional 
financial institutions. A ride hailing service th at is financing the driver’s automobile 
can monitor usage, maintenance patterns, and cash flows. A distribution platform offering working capital credi t to retailers purchasing inventory could cut off the 
supply of goods if the retailer is late in repaying; similarly, an e-commerce platform 
providing logistics and financing to merchants could seize inventory. Given network effects and high switching costs, big tech s could enforce loan repayments by the 
simple threat of a downgrade or exclusio n from their ecosystem in case of default. 
Their position as customer gatekeepers in their core businesses helps establish roles 
as gatekeepers and potentially enforcers fo r financial services, as well. Although 
research has shown that fint ech and big tech credit tends to complement, rather than 
replace, other forms of credit (see Box B), some big techs have explored becoming a 
full-fledged deposit-taking financ ial institution. Big techs ac tive in EMDEs, with lower 
levels of financial development and inclusion and more permissive regulatory 
environments, have had more scope to vent ure on this path. Other jurisdictions 
impose limits to the span of activities of regulated financial institutions, with the result that big techs have not taken on a regulatory status that might restrict their ability to continue their other activities.

Individuals as financial services providers 
Technology will enable individuals to move beyond providing finance via 
intermediaries. Today, individual savers pr ovide the deposits that banks use to lend, 
and equity capital via investment and pensio n funds. There is the occasional direct Box B 
The data-network-activity feedback loop ma y explain the rapid growth of big tech 
credit 
The data-network-activity (DNA) feedback loop helps big te ch firms to correctly predict clients’ creditworthiness, 
future income and individual demands (BIS 2019). As a resu lt, big techs can have a competitive advantage over banks 
and serve firms and households that othe rwise would remain unbanked. Recent wo rk suggests that big techs’ credit 
scoring applied to small vendors outperforms models ba sed on credit bureau ratings and traditional borrower 
characteristics (Frost et al 2019; Gamb acorta et al 2019). All this could repres ent a significant advance in financial 
inclusion and help improve firms’ pe rformance (see Luohan Academy, 2018). 
Cornelli et al (2020a) find that in 2019, fintech and big te ch credit (together “total alternative credit”) reached 
nearly USD 800 bn globally (see Figure B1 ). Big tech credit has shown particularly  rapid growth in Asia (China, Japan, 
Korea and Southeast Asia), and some count ries in Africa and Latin America. By contrast, fintech credit volumes have 
declined in 2018-19 due to market and regu latory developments in Ch ina. Outside China, fintec h credit is still growing. 
These alternative forms of credit are more developed in c ountries with higher GDP per capita (at a declining rate), 
where banking sector mark-ups are higher and where banking re gulation is less stringent. Fintech credit is also more 
developed where there are fewer bank branches per capita . Moreover, these alternative forms of credit are more 
developed where the ease of doing business is higher, invest or protection disclosure and the efficiency of the judicial 
system are higher, the bank credit to deposit ratio is lowe r, and where bond and equity markets are more developed. 
Overall, both fintech and big tech credit seems to compleme nt other forms of credit, not to substitute for them, and 
may increase overall credit access.

 family loan, or high net worth angel invest or providing direct finance. Technology 
could allow this to be much mo re pervasive. P2P was an initial step in that direction. 
Reduction of the frictions that give rise to intermediation raises the prospect of 
radical disintermediation such  that individuals become financial services providers 
directly. The core of financial services is the transfer of resour ces between individuals 
directly and over time. New technologies  could decentralize decision-making, risk-
taking and record keeping (FSB 2019a). Di stributed ledger techno logies (DLT) have 
already demonstrated the potential for transf ers of value without intermediaries. P2P 
lending was designed as a way to directly transfer resources and risk, with limited 
centralized matching services by the P2P platform. Technology obviates the need for 
a bank balance sheet by synthesizing a set of contributing liabilities against each asset 
(loan) as it is originated. Even these platforms could be eliminated. Dras tic reductions 
in search costs could allow individuals at the retail level to connect directly to borrowers. Publicly available data and an alytics applications could be applied to 
investments decisions and portfolio construction at the individual level, as 
robo-advisors are already doing. Smart co ntracts could automate monitoring and 
collection processes and reduce  the coordination costs for a borrower working with 
multiple small lenders.  
To date, consumers have not broadly embraced the ro l e  o f  d i r e c t  p a y m e n t s  
provider in decentralized models. DL T-based alternative payments via 
cryptocurrencies are growing but the ma in use of cryptocurrencies has been 
speculation rather than payments. Most in dividuals using crypto-currency still prefer 
to go through crypto-currency wallet pr oviders or exchanges . While decentralized 
finance (“DeFi”) and decentralized apps (“DApps”) are growing, these are still a niche 
market (Schär 2021). Other venues that mi ght have fostered direct peer-to-peer 
exchange such as soci al media platforms and messaging  apps have either offered 
payments intermediation themse lves or linked to banks.  
Similarly, individuals have been reluctan t to act as direct lenders assuming full 
responsibility for credit screening and lending decisions. P2P marketplaces initially offered savers the ability to choose individual borrowers. The option for micro-
assembly of loan portfolios is not much used, however; most consumers chose to let 
the platforms algorithmically allocate thei r funds. Behaviour on equity crowdfunding 
platforms is somewhat different , though increasingly these platforms are also offering 
diversified fund structures to consumers who would prefer not to individually vet 
investments. OurCrowd, for example, began with a direct indivi dual selection model 
but now operates a full menu of funds to allow investors to programmatically deploy and diversify.  
The direction of technology and deve lopments in decentralized finance, 
however, suggests that thes e trends bear monitoring. Wh ile savings and investment 
activities still bear a high cost of assembly , part of the promise of technology is the 
empowerment of individuals. Technology is  reducing the need for intermediaries. Un-
intermediated finance would render any in dividual with surplus funds a financial 
services provider. While the emergence of in dividuals as direct providers of financial 
services is nascent at presen t, it cannot be discounted as a potential influence on 
market structure in the future.   
 
BIS Papers No 117 27
 3.4 Impact on sector compositi on, competition, concentration 
The diversity of the financial sector has increased in both dev eloped and emerging 
markets. Alongside incumbents, there are ma ny different types and sizes of fintechs 
and big techs, offering a wide range of financial services. Some remain focused on a 
single product or service, while others  have leveraged their initial successes to 
broaden their service offerings (eg Square  a n d  P a y P a l  m o v i n g  f r o m  p a y m e n t s  t o  
lending). Some fintechs are converting to banks, while others have become service 
providers to, or value chain partners with banks. Depending on licensing approaches 
in different jurisdictions, a range of digita l-only or digital-mainly neo-banks emerged. 
They compete largely in the same regu latory space as incumbents, but with 
modernized business models and streamlined infrastructure. Big techs with core 
markets ranging from telecommunications to logistics, transportation, e-commerce 
marketplaces, and online search  add another set of diverse players to the industry. 
Incumbents are also adopting new technology, partnering with fintechs, setting up new digital units and otherwise adapting  to the new environment. This hyper-
diversification of financial services has im plications for competition, as well as for 
regulation (see section 4). 
Fintechs have significantly increased competitive pressu re by directly engaging 
with the consumer. The battle to ‘own the customer’ will be closely fought, since in 
most industries the links in the value chai n closest to the cust omer earn the highest 
margins (eg European Banking Authority ( 2018), OECD (2020), Petralia (2020)). Some 
fintechs have skilfully targeted high-margi n products or services and stripped those 
away from incumbents, leaving the incumbents with a lower-margin product mix. For example, companies like Wise (previously Transferwise) and Remitly targeted the 
relatively high-margin international transfer business. However, many fintechs are 
struggling to compete at scale. Through re -bundling, some digital-only banks may 
be able to broaden scope and compete at scale, but at the cost of having to maintain 
a broader product mix in which some products or customers will generate lower margins. 
Disruption may be contained in areas where fintechs them selves relying on 
incumbents for their operations. As described above, many fintechs still rely on banks 
to store value and process payments, and users often originate fintech transactions 
from an account with a financial institution. Products like Wise rely on existing bank or card accounts not only for the cash-in/cash-out (CI/CO) functions, but also for a 
layer of KYC compliance. In some markets, digital financial services providers have 
built their own infrastructure for some of these functions (eg mobile agent networks 
for CI/CO). The introduction of stableco ins and CBDCs might r educe the dependence 
of fintechs on incumbents, particularly for payment services.  
For fintechs that target back-office acti vities, the relationship with incumbents 
will be collaborative. For example, B2B fintec hs offer services to incumbents in the 
form of partnerships or SaaS engageme nts. BaaS providers present a distinct 
competitive challenge.  These regulated banks enable a range of businesses, including 
fintechs, to compete more effectively with other  banks. The ability to embed a tailored 
payment, loan, insurance or other financia l service into any economic, business, or 
social activity may be the most powerful di sruptor of traditional financial services, and 
this is an area in which big techs excel.  
Big techs have the potential to compete at scale and become dominant players. 
They already enjoy economies of scale and scope and network effe cts in their core  
 
28 BIS Papers No 117
 markets. By adding financial services to their ecosystems, on their own or using BaaS, 
they can leverage these ec onomies to compete with traditional providers and 
fintechs. They also have the clout and deep  pockets to navigate  complex regulations 
and build parallel infrastructures and closed-loop systems, which could solidify their role as gatekeepers to the consumer (and th eir relevant data) in the financial sector. 
The resulting “winner-takes-all” or “w inner-takes-most” dynamics may reduce 
competition and contestability of the sect or and trigger monopolistic behaviour as 
customers become locked-in. Some big tech s (eg AliPay) fortify customer lock-in by 
allowing funds to flow into their systems for free but charging a fee for withdrawals. 
They may tie the availability of a loan to consumption of other platform services, or 
cross-subsidize financial services with reve nues from their core business. This could 
result in consumer benefits but destructive competition for the rest of the sector and 
potentially in other sectors. While there ar e ways regulators can attempt to re-level 
the playing field,
10 the intermingling of financial and non-financial services presents 
a number of challenging financial regulation and competition policy issues (see 
below). 
Incumbents large and small are embrac ing digital transformation across the 
value chain to compete with  fintechs and big techs. Competitive pressure on 
traditional financial institutions may force even those that are lagging to transform or risk erosion of their customer  base, income, and margins. In addition to partnering 
with fintechs, some have set up their ow n digital-only banks. Where regulation 
permits, as in Thailand, some banks have countered the big tech incursion into banking with bank-centric e-commerce market place offerings (for example, Kasikorn 
Bank’s K+ market). Formerly captive loca l markets have become highly contestable 
by international players (eg DBS entry to India via Digibank). Local banks or those 
serving specific industries may still be competitive in their niche markets, if they can manage the transition to digital delivery an d maintain customer trust and loyalty, and 
the other competitors don’t turn their focus to those niches.  
The largest markets might be expect ed to receive more attention from 
innovators, but small markets are affected as well. Overall, fintech adoption seems to 
be higher in higher-income markets (Didier et al 2021), and these will often be more 
attractive for Venture Capital investment. However, some mid-size countries have 
been ahead of the digital finance curve, perhaps because they had not received 
sufficient investment in traditional financial services and there were more 
underserved segments or larger margins to  capture. Kenya’s ecosystem of digital 
payments, savings, and lending is a prominen t example. Innovators in small countries 
can leverage the cost reductions discussed above to enter markets that may not have 
been viable with a higher co st structure. For some services, however, small markets 
may lag in terms of home-grown innovation. Innovations centred on data use may 
advance faster in larger markets that generate more data (World Bank 2021). 
Emerging and smaller markets could nonetheless benefit from incumbent 
transformation or geographic extension.  The local incumbents can adopt new 
technologies to improve reach and effici ency, and large regi onal telecom and e-
commerce players could extend financial services into these smaller markets. The 
 
10  In Thailand, for example, regulators responde d to e-commerce entry into financial services by 
permitting banks to operate e-comme rce marketplaces and offer certain IT services to their clients.

BIS Papers No 117 29
 ability to serve remotely could make a small market part of a larger market, provided 
the regulatory frameworks permit.  
More intense competition among a more diverse set of industry participants 
could result in a range of possible mark et outcomes. As diff erent institutions 
compete, cooperate or do bo th, industry structure will evolve, depending on which 
combination of three forces prevail in a given market. 
1. Economies of scale and scope:  where production costs remain significant relative 
to revenues (or cross-subsidization is possible), and network effects and 
switching costs or convenience effects are significant, we may expect 
consolidation into a set of large players who can leverage scale in capital, connectivity, and data to offer a broad ra nge of products at high volume and low 
cost. This could potentially also result in displacement of incumbent financial 
institutions by big tech firms, in particular in the retail banking domain. The conditions for “natural monopolies” coul d result from strong scale economies 
combined with low marginal costs of service provision. These are countered by 
the reduction in fixed costs that allow for smaller scale entry.  
2. Preferences for choice or convenience:  As we have seen, alongside the economies 
of scale achievable by big players, technology has enabled unbundling of 
products and services. These may vary  along price, quality, and service 
dimensions. Customer can choose a custom mix of separate products and self-
aggregate. This is more likely when cust omers are extremely price-sensitive or 
value more tailored servic es, and search an d switching costs are low. Niche 
providers can then focus on  product-market fit for a target customer base, and 
t h a t  c u s t o m e r  b a s e  c a n  e a s i l y  f i n d  t h e product and migrate to it. The niche 
providers can thrive, taking advantage of their ability to manage infrastructure costs while reaching and retaining their target customers wherever they may be. 
The unbundling effects coul d dominate, with a result ing atomization of the 
industry. In this scenario , there would be space for new players that enable 
aggregation of the services and those that provide commo n services to the entire 
market. On the other hand, too much choice can overwhelm individuals and 
undermine the benefits that choice ca n provide (Schwartz, 2005). Search and 
switching costs may reduce the convenience of self-aggregation. Customers may 
then prefer banks or platforms that integr ate services for them, even if they end 
up paying more or accepting inferi or service for one or more products. 
3. Regulation:  The above two forces will not play out independently from the 
actions of financial services and competition regulators, who will continue to shape outcomes with a vari ety of policy instruments. 
Given the diversity of providers and cons umers, the corner solutions of large 
multi-product players and small focused play ers may co-exist. As shown in Graph 8, 
the tendency of providers to seek scale (leverage scale, scope, and network 
economies) alongside consumer  preferences for choice coul d result in four potential 
configurations, of which two appear to be dominant outcomes. A small player (left 
bottom corner) attempting to provide a broad range of products will find it difficult 
to deliver fully across that product range, and will be pressured to either merge with others to grow large (left upper corner) or  to focus on niche services (right lower 
corner). A large company with an initially narrow scope (right upper corner) will find 
that its size enables it to broaden, and will tend to add products (left upper corner). 
For instance, a payments firm may choose to add lending or insurance services, while an international money services provider may start offering checking accounts.  
 
30 BIS Papers No 117
 Thus the financial services market may coalesce around one set of providers 
adopting large/multi-product strategies, and another set offering focused products 
and services. This might be termed a “barbell” distribution, with a small set of large 
multi-product players on one side, and a large set of small niche service players on 
the other.11 While this market structure reflects  in part the “winner-takes-all” or 
“winner-takes-most” character of some tech -driven markets, the impact of friction 
and cost-reducing innovation in finance leaves the door open for smaller players to 
thrive. If regulation permits, this may mean continued market fluidity from new 
entrants and cross-overs from one sub-sector to another. 
The large, multi-product players could in clude traditional players, fintechs and 
big techs – ie both incumbents and new en trants (Graph 9). Th ese may include banks 
that master the digital transf ormation, along with new financial services entrants that 
achieve scale, and big techs or other firm s that have customer data and can link to 
BaaS. A recent survey indica ted that large banks are ahead of smaller banks in terms 
of digital transformation, and are overall more positive about the impact of 
technology on their businesses (Feyen et al 2021). Banks that pull ahead in terms of 
digitization will be able to leverage the DNA feedback loop to grow market share 
relative to other banks. Some technology-s avvy and agile smaller or newer banks and 
bank-like players could also  ride this wave to grow.12 Big techs, on the other hand, 
enter the large size of the barbell on the strength of the customer base they bring 
 
11  So-called ‘barbell’ distributions, with clusters on two ends of the scale, have been observed in many 
markets, including labour markets (Autor 2019), product pricing and qua lity (Britton, 2018), and 
portfolio strategy (Rutherford 2013). Such distributions have been observed in banking markets in previous periods or disr uption, for example in the wake of mega-mergers in the US in the 1990s 
(Deogun 1996) and the financial crisis of 2008. 
12  For example, NuBank (a payment services provider ) in Brazil went rapidly from challenger to 30 
million customers, placing it in the top ranks in that  market. Cross-River Bank in the US has just one 
branch, but leveraged fintech to be one of the bi ggest lenders nationwide for the US Government’s 
pandemic response program (Cowley 2020). Corner solutions of scale vs. atomization Graph 8

The small, niche players could also incl ude some traditional providers alongside 
fintechs (Graph 9). Niche players may direct ly serve customers with a focused product 
set, or may serve large players with B2B se rvices. Small local institutions such as 
community banks and credit cooperative banks, for example, occupy geographic 
niches and fill gaps not served by larger in stitutions, and may have significant trust 
capital as a competitive advantage (Mester 2018). A recent study of regional banks in 
the US found that many have been able to  leverage technology and geographic focus 
to thrive against large scale players (Ale xopoulos 2020). Many fintechs enter the 
market as single product providers or with a product tailored to a specific market segment, such as small businesses in a give n industry or set of markets. Unbundled 
fintech service providers with a strong va lue proposition can viably serve a narrow 
market given the ability to reduce fi xed costs using flexible cloud-based 
infrastructure, digital channels, and othe r service delivery innovations, and build 
customer affinity with tailored products. De-centralization through DLT and other 
innovations will enable service providers to build on these new products and infrastructures to provide additional unb undled services. Small niche players could 
thus continue to thrive as they tailor their products and services to a specific market 
segment or customer base. As noted abov e, there are scenario s where individuals 
could act as direct providers of certain pr oducts or services; these would be extreme 
instances of small niche players. 
There is likely to be a degree of connectivi ty between the two en ds of the barbell. 
Some narrow, tailored services will partner with large institutions to provide their 
specialized services to the customers of the larger institutions, while big techs and 
other platforms may provide some of the co nnectivity that allows small fintechs to 
reach customers. The size of both ends  of the barbell are also influenced by 
regulations that might limit the size of a particular firm.

 A barbell is a potential steady state market  structure, as some participants grow 
larger but innovation drives continued entr y. During the current transition phase, 
small multi-product providers and mid-size pl ayers continue to operate, increasingly 
challenged to compete against the scale pl ayers or to lock in a focused niche. 
Re-bundling by the larger fo rmerly single-product fintechs is well underway in the 
more advanced markets, and entry by big tech s is adding to the large player end of 
the distribution directly. Entry can continua lly replenish the small player end of the 
distribution. Large players will inevitably leave some markets less well-served and new 
technologies will continue to reduce costs or offer the prospect of new products. As 
long as regulatory barriers are not rais ed, entrepreneurs will continue to bring 
innovative new products and services to  the market; these may not compete across 
the board with the large players but pr ovide a reservoir of contestability to 
counterbalance the concentrated end of the barbell. As illustrated in Graph 8, there will be a tendency for players to either fo cus or to move to the large/multi-product 
space. Left to market forces , the dominance of the two si des of the barbell may very 
well squeeze out the middle (except insofar as a company passes through on its growth path from one side to the other). Those providers that cannot achieve the 
scale to compete with the larger provider s but fail to focus on a sustainable niche 
may be forced to exit. A recent survey by FIS on new banking relationships established in the US in the last 12 months showed that 37% of new banking relationships went 
to large banks and 48% went to niche and neo banks (community banks, credit 
unions, online banks and non-bank entities);  the in-between regi onal banks got only 
10% (see Marous 2021). 
A barbell is not the only possible outcome, but is a central case given the 
economic forces at work. Co ntinued atomization, stalled re-aggregation, or limits on 
entry could result in a different configuration. Factors that will contribute to determining this outcome incl ude core market forces such  as the economies of scale 
and scope discussed above, r egulatory limits on entry or on re-aggregation by non-
banks, and consumer preferences for trus ted incumbents or for convenience and 
internal product linkage vs. tailored solutions and more direct control. Societal 
preferences will matter and will be express ed not only by consumers but also in the 
degree to which policies for, and regulation of, financial services, competition, and 
consumer protection shape both mark et forces and consumer behaviour. 
4. Policy implications and new trade-offs 
National authorities aim to foster the benefits of digital transformation in finance. 
These include reduced costs and frictions, increased e fficiency and competition, 
narrowing information asymmetry, and broadened access to financial services. At the same time, authorities are aware of the pote ntial risks to the financial system and to 
customers (FSB 2017). A policy agenda (“Ba li Fintech Agenda”) ou tlined by the World 
Bank and IMF advocates embracing the promi se of fintech while managing risks to 
consumers and to the stability and integrity of the financial system (World Bank/IMF 
2018). In particular, reinforcing competition  and a commitment to open, free, and 
contestable markets were seen as a foundat ion for innovation and consumer choice 
while maintaining a level playing field. The Agenda also re cognized the need to adapt 
regulatory frameworks and supervisory practices , including monitoring of new market 
participants, to facilitate the safe entry of  new products, activities, and intermediaries 
while maintaining financial stability and sustaining trust, confidence, and the ability  
 
BIS Papers No 117 33
 to respond to risks. The importance of robust data infrastructure, both from a 
cybersecurity perspective and with respect to concentration risks, data ownership, 
protection, and privacy, was also noted. 
Reinforcing competition requires taking bo th horizontal and vertical views of the 
financial services landscape, and cooper ation between financial and competition 
authorities. Horizontally, how a market is  defined is fundamental to the assessment 
of competition. The multiplicity of financial products, the tendency to bundle them, and the role of multi-sided ma rket dynamics in providing and pricing all make this a 
more complex landscape. Vertically, a compet itive market at the consumer level may 
mask concentration at different levels of the reconfigured financial services value chains. With finance increasingly embedded as an adjunct in ot her businesses, it 
becomes critical for financial regulators  to coordinate with  other regulators, 
particularly where the adjacent businesses  are themselves highly concentrated or 
subject to network effects. Co nsideration of ex ante vs ex  post remedies may need to 
recognize the particular featur es of data concentration, th e power to exclude, and the 
gateway functions inherent in em erging digital business models.  
Adapting regulatory frameworks will require recognizing new and sometimes 
heightened trade-offs between specific polic y goals. Changes in provider diversity 
and the competitive landscap e may imply a need to revisit the regulatory perimeter 
and supervisory practices. Meanwhile, auth orities may need to make tough choices 
between: (i) financial stability and market integrity, (ii) efficiency and competition, and 
(iii) data privacy and consumer protection. It is important to find policies that can 
mitigate these trade-offs and allow priority  goals to be achieved simultaneously to 
the degree possible. In the next sections  we explore the implications for the 
regulatory perimeter, supervisory practices,  and competition, an d the relevant trade-
offs between the policies that authorities are adopting in practice.  
4.1 Implications for the regula tory perimeter and supervisory 
practices 
The growing diversity of financial serv ices providers and business models often 
requires expanding the regula tory perimeter. Payments, loans, and deposit taking 
services may be provided by specialized payment service providers (fintechs), 
e-commerce platforms (big techs), and other no n-banks. It is therefore important that 
regulators develop approaches to ensure  a level playing field and provide clear 
requirements for licensing. Similar activities  and similar risks should in principle be 
treated similarly, regardless of the market  participant, underlying technology, or 
method by which the service is provided. Yet in practice, a purely activities-based 
approach to regulation may not be sufficien t. Particularly the entry of big techs may 
require more, not less, entity-based regulation, for instance to address risks around 
competition and operational resilience (Restoy 2021). Expansion of the regulatory 
perimeter can ensure that activities are appropriately and comparably regulated and 
supervised (World Bank and IMF 2018; Alonso et al 2021; Ehrentraud et al 2020). This 
may extend to the perimeter of financial sa fety nets. Data reporting perimeters may 
need to be expanded even fu rther, given the disaggregation of finance and the 
embedding of financial services into non-fina ncial activities. The adoption of targeted 
regtech and suptech solutions may merit cons ideration by regulators as part of the 
policy response to fintech develop ments (Broeders and Prenio 2018).   
 
34 BIS Papers No 117
 Expanding the regulatory perimeter may be challenging in practice. Bringing new 
entities into the fold of financial regula tion may require legislative changes, which 
could be considered controversial and may be resisted by powerful interests with 
deep pockets, such as big techs. Ther e may be resistance to granting more 
discretionary powers to supervisors, ev en though such powe rs may be needed to 
continually adapt policy approaches to a changing sector. The challenges may be 
even more acute in EMDEs, where resource constraints make it more difficult to stay 
abreast of changes and to regu late powerful (foreign) serv ice providers. Yet emerging 
policy approaches in several jurisdictions show that applying an entity-based 
approach to new players such as big te chs may be possible (see section 4.2).  
The disaggregation and reconfiguration of  finance value chains introduces new 
challenges in day-to-day supervision. For a tr aditional, vertically integrated bank, it is 
clear where responsibility lies for the financial soundness, cybersecurity, and consumer impacts of a product. When the financial services value chain is spread 
across different players with, for example,  one holding the customer relationship, 
another holding the customer funds, a th ird providing data analytics and deciding 
which customers get services, and a fourth providing technology infrastructure, it is 
more difficult to pin down responsibility for mishaps or misdeeds and to ensure that 
consumers’ interests are protected. More over, when customer  interactions are 
handled by entities that are not directly  subject to extant consumer protection 
regulations, any shortcomin gs such as unfair practi ces may not surface through 
traditional supervision focused on the regu lated entity. This can lead to undetected 
consumer protection risks. This becomes even more challenging when services are 
provided across borders.  
Complex processes and interactions across different players and systems can 
create new points of failure. Multiple entiti es and interlinkages cr eate a wider attack 
surface for cybercriminals, which requires a strong regulatory approach to promote 
cyber security. The balance of power in these partnership relationships is very 
different than in a traditional outsourcing relationship, so the ability of the regulated financial institution to enforce its own policies might be challenging. Multi-tiered 
access to regulated systems, for exampl e through BaaS models, requires that 
regulators ensure that the BaaS provider has sufficient visibility through the value chain to ensure compliance. In some circumstances, regu lators may need to extend 
their supervision past the first-tier regu lated entity, downstre am to the customer 
interface entity or upstream to infrastructure providers. 
Reconfiguration of value chains is creating concentration risks at the technology 
services level that need to be monitored from both competition and systemic stability 
perspectives. The cloud services market is highly concentrated. While provision of services to financial institutions has long been subject to concentration (for example, 
limited numbers of mainframe, ATM, ca sh transport, and payments network 
providers), growing reliance by a large swath of the financial sector on a small number 
of cloud services providers has been fl agged as carrying the potential for new 
concentration or single-point-of-failure risks (FSB 2019b). Notably, four players 
control around two thirds of the global ma rket for cloud services (Graph 10). While 
cloud providers generally have deep expert ise in systems arch itecture and cyber 
security, an operational or cyber incident at one major cloud pr ovider could have 
systemic implications for the financial system (Danielsson and Macrae 2020). Open 
infrastructure, including API hubs, KYC utilities, and changing access policy for 
existing payment systems and credit re porting infrastructures, can mitigate 
concentration risks, increase contestability , and dilute data concentrations. However,  
 
BIS Papers No 117 35
 there are indicators that a number of B2B fintech services may be equally prone to 
concentration; the example of API middleware pr oviders cited earlier is a case in point.  
As authorities contemplate the regulatory and supervisory response to fintech, 
developments need to be examined in light of  the needs in each market. Some of the 
issues related to disaggregation and the in corporation of new players into financial 
product value chains can be addressed thro ugh regulatory guidan ce on governance 
of partnerships and outsourcing, including clear allocation of responsibilities and 
supervisory reporting, applied to each individual institution. Traditionally, regulators 
have placed responsibility for regulatory compliance with the licensed institution. However, as mentioned before, this may no t work in a scenario  where the licensed 
institution has much less scope to enforce sp ecific requirements – for example a small 
niche player partnering with a big tech or  using a global cloud provider. Thus, many 
challenges, such as up- or downstream conc entration risks, may need to be addressed 
at the sector level, eg through enhanc ed oversight of syst emically important 
providers. Further, regulatory authorit ies might need to increase their ongoing 
scrutiny of the operational and process mo del of licensed instit utions and introduce 
changes to ensure that they are able to discharge their co nsumer protection 
responsibilities. 
4.2 Implications for competition policy 
Concentration risks in financial service provision may increase under the central 
scenario outlined above. Digital platform pr oviders in particular may quickly achieve 
dominant positions. On its own, this need not have a detrimental effect on consumer 
choice and welfare, even if a small number  of dominant players reduces coordination 
barriers and may increase the risk of collusion. Provided switching costs remain low, 
markets can remain contestable and deliver beneficial outcomes – even in a barbell 
market structure. On the other hand, the conc entration of big data may result in data 
monopolies. Data-driven advantages of lar ger players can increa se switching costs 
and effectively lock in certain customers, and  ex post remedies for abuse of this 
customer lock-in may be difficu lt. In such cases ex ante remedies by the sectoral 
regulators on the ability to switch or inte roperability requirements are better suited. Market share of leading firms in the cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)

 Graph 11 compares ex ante sectoral regulations with ex post competition 
interventions. As an example, the largest two mobile payment providers in China 
reached a combined market share of 94% in 2019 (FSB 2019). The authorities were 
concerned that this could also pose severe systemic risks if one such provider were 
to be impaired. In 2018 the People’s Bank of China (PBC) implem ented a new mobile 
payment regulation requiring all mobile payments to be cleared through the PBC 
rather than settled internally within the mobile payment platform provider (Liu 2019). 
In this way, a sector-specific ex ante appr oach was able to addr ess concerns  rather 
than waiting for ex post correction.  
While overall financial services may remain competitive, in certain specific 
product segments monopolies or quasi-mo nopolies could emerge. Some services, 
such as exchanges, have inherent network and scale economies that could result in 
only a very few viable providers. While this  is not new, the entry of companies from 
adjacent spaces or the emb edding of financial services into non-financial products 
means the market structure of those industries becomes relevant. A monopoly utility 
or logistics company could require customers to use its embedded payment 
instrument. It could also embed working ca pital lines that could not be obtained by 
most customers from other le nders who do not have the data and leverage of these 
providers. This would allow th em to effectively dominate a financial services segment 
by virtue of the control held in the primary industry. The movement of highly Interplay of ex ante sectoral regulations and ex post interventions by competition

 concentrated mobile network operators into payments, often setting up their own 
proprietary agent networks, is an exam ple of how a player from concentrated 
adjacent market that is regulated with re spect to competition ca n carry that market 
structure over into a financial product area where the regulation was not attuned to that issue. Kenya provides a case study of regulatory response to  concentrated market 
structure and anticompetit ive behaviours in digital payments (see Box C).  
The proliferation of new products has no t always resulted in competition at all 
levels of the restructured value chains. The consumer-facing end of payments has become more diverse, with a range of wa llets, affinity and prepaid card programs, 
and embedded payments offerings. At the un derlying transaction processing level, 
though, there is an oligopoly in many ma rkets. In 2016, the UK Payment Systems 
Regulator (PSR) review ed the ownership and co mpetitiveness of infrastructure that 
supports the three majo r UK payment systems – BACS, Fa ster Payments Service, and 
LINK – and found there was no effective co mpetition for the provision of UK payments 
infrastructure (UK PSR 2016). Various measures were proposed to increase 
competition and remove barriers to entry.  Box C 
Competition in digital paym ents: the case of Kenya

of 2010. It is mandated to promote and safeguard comp etition in the national econom y by effectively enforcing 
competition law and rules economy-wide, to  open markets by advocating for the removal of anticompetitive sector 
regulation, and to protect consumers and suppliers. CAK has intervened in a number of sector cases. With specific 
regard to the market for digital payments, the shapes below report the identified issues, the policy actions taken, and

 A similar challenge is emer ging in the context of op en banking and APIs. The 
back-end connection to APIs to facilitate da ta exchange is a high-volume, low-margin 
business. But since each bank may have different API specifications, it can be costly 
for a specific provider, such as a fintech start-up, to develop connections to everyone. 
Aggregation occurs at a middleware level th rough players like Plaid, Tink, and Yodlee. 
These are emerging as domi nant networks of API connections, a potentially 
oligopolistic layer at the choke point betw een more competitive segments. Even in 
markets where APIs are standa rdized, API hubs are emerging to simplify the interface 
requirements. 
While unbundling would tend to reduce anti-competitive product tying, re-
aggregation and embedding potentially put ty ing at the centre of financial product 
economics. In particular, platform models that combin e free services that have 
network effects with financial services migh t represent exactly the type of situation 
anti-trust authorities were concerned with in establishing anti-tying rules: that a 
monopoly provider of one service might requ ire customers to use its other products. 
Thus a dominant social network platform that has a quasi-monopoly position over small local businesses’ connections to thei r customers might embed payments in the 
social networking experience, and make it difficult for a customer to pay the business 
through anything other than the network’s payment product. The more dominant the 
social network, the more necessary it is for a business to be present on that platform, 
effectively reducing competition in paym ents acceptance. Dominant technology 
companies have already run afoul of anti-t ying regulations (eg Apple, Microsoft). 
While regulators have moved away from considering tying arrangements to be illegal 
per se, and focused more on rule-of-reason analysis that looks at both the benefits 
and potential costs of tying, these analyses are sure to be  tested as financial services 
tying moves from the ""traditional bank prod uct exception"" space to the sphere of big 
techs and embedded finance. 
Market structures that co ncentrate data and supercha rge network effects could 
reduce intermediation costs an d broaden inclusion. In ma ny markets, however, the 
resulting market power might be seen as more detrimenta l than these benefits. For 
example, in November 2020 the US Department of Justic e sued to block the proposed 
merger of Visa, a payments company, and Pl aid, a fintech data aggregation platform; 
the merger was abandoned in early 2021. Ch inese regulators have recently addressed 
concerns of anti-competitive practices that exclude compet itors in associated digital 
services such as e-commerce and social m edia when providing services to customers 
(McMorrow 2021). As in other industries, regulators will have to balance the 
efficiencies of natural monopolies against re straining market power. This is not a new 
consideration in financial services, but is ju st one of several trade-offs that become 
more pronounced as technology re -shapes financial services.  
Different societies will also attach different preferences to market structure 
outcomes. Regulatory policies governing entr y and scope of activity of new players, 
from small fintechs to big tech platforms,  will have profound effects on competitive 
dynamics both in financial services and in the core industries of  cross-over players. 
Fintech and big tech will require changes in the way that competition authorities and financial regulators interact, and calls for more coordination between regulators 
(Petralia et al 2019). Approaches to compet ition policy differ starkly across societies. 
Some societies may welcome market structures that concentrate data and supercharge network effects if they r educe intermediation costs and broaden 
inclusion. In other markets, the result ing market power might be seen as more 
detrimental than these benefi ts. Concentration of infrastr ucture and data in state  
 
BIS Papers No 117 39
 hands may be accepted in some societies, while others may be more concerned about 
potential extension of state surveillance. As in other industries, regulators will have to 
balance the efficiencies of natural monopolies against restraining market power. This 
is not a new consideration in financial servic es, but is just one of  several trade-offs 
that become more pronounced as technology re-shapes financial services.  
4.3 New dimensions to financia l regulation policy trade-offs 
Digital innovation may thus give rise to complex trade-offs between three categories 
of policy goals. These are: (i) financial stabilit y and market integrity; (ii) efficiency and 
competition; and (iii) data privacy and co nsumer protection. Graph 12 gives a visual 
representation of these trade- offs as a triangle. This final section discusses the three 
edges of the triangle in turn – and which types of policies authorities are applying to 
mitigate these trade-offs.  
Efficiency and competition vs financial stability and integrity 
Regulators have long debat ed the relationship between competition and financial 
stability. There are broadly two schools of thought on the competition-stability nexus 
(red arrow in Graph 12). One school of thou ght argues that greater market entry, or 
at least contestability, in the financial sector  is desirable, as it fosters competition and 
reduces incumbents’ market po wer. This can lead to gr eater efficiency and better 
outcomes for customers. It can also lead to more diversified activities (Amidu and 
Wolfe 2013) and fewer institutions that are individually systemically important and 
must be treated as “too-big-to-fail.” Syst emic importance can introduce governance 
challenges and moral hazard, as well as a fina ncial sector that is, on aggregate, larger 
than would be economically optimal (Feldman 2010). An al ternative school of thought 
emphasizes that greater comp etition is not always optimal or conducive to financial 
stability. Financial institutions that are more profitable may be able to accumulate Policy trade-offs from digita l transformation in finance Graph 12

40 BIS Papers No 117
 more equity capital, have a higher franchise value  and therefore act more prudently 
(Keeley 1990). This may occur at least up to a point where they incur moral hazard by 
becoming too big to fail. An implication may be that some barriers to entry are 
justified to help mitigate risks (Hellman et al 2000). This may be particularly true in a 
period of rapid market transition. New entr ants can target high-margin products, or 
skim off the most profitable customers, leaving incumbents with loss-making and 
riskier businesses. Regulators may view ma naging incumbents’ adjustments to either 
adoption of new technology, consolidation, or exit with a slower  pace of entry or 
dampened competition as more welfare-su staining than rapid and potentially 
disruptive exits. 
Fintech and big tech entry may turn some  existing insights on their head. In 
particular, the assumption that entry increases competition may no longer be true in 
an environment supercharged by the DNA f eedback loop (see Box B). While there is 
agreement that contestability matters grea tly for the overall degree of competition 
(Claessens 2009), and the reservoir of cont estants represented by the small niche 
services side of the barbell would tend to ma intain at least some competitive pressure 
on the larger players, big te chs with control over key digi tal platforms in e-commerce, 
search or social media may establish and entrench market powe r very quickly after 
entry. Such control may also  generate conflicts of intere st when both big techs and 
their competitors (eg banks) rely on the sa me core infrastructures such as networks 
or cloud computing services.  
The traditional focus of competition authorities on a single market, firm size, 
pricing and concentration may no longer be well suited to thes e market outcomes. 
Indeed, digital platforms that pu rsue growth over profits, and data over revenue, may 
not be well-captured by competition polic y approaches focusing on prices and 
consumer welfare (Khan 2017). While indica tors of market power like large market 
share and high margins provide useful first-order indication s, they are insufficient to 
determine whether a provider has market po wer and has the incent ives to abuse it. 
Moreover, the speed of changes to market st ructure presents cha llenges, as firms can 
go from “too small to care” to “too large to ignore” to “too big to fail” in only a few 
short years (Arner et al 2017). This was appa rent particularly with the growth of the 
big techs in China, but similar growth is bein g seen in many other markets, particularly 
EMDEs. Large foreign players in particular may become “too powerful to regulate and 
supervise.” Ex post remedial action, as with traditional antitrust and mergers policies, 
may not be sufficient to address risks.  
This may be a reason that some juri sdictions have upgraded their rules and 
methodologies for assessing and addressing anticompetitive conduct. In India, for 
example, the main e-commerce platform s are prohibited from selling products 
supplied by affiliated companies on their websites – including financial products – to 
avoid potential conflicts of interest (BIS  2019). In the EU, proposals for a Digital 
Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) include ex ante  requirements on 
“gatekeepers” to prevent self-preferencing and bundling or tying,  and requirements 
on “very large platforms” around reporting, risk assessment and crisis protocols 
(European Commission 2020a,b). In the UK, the Digital Competition Expert Panel (“Furman Report,” HM Treasury 2019) re commended the establishment of a digital 
markets unit to develop a competitive code of  conduct, enable gr eater personal data 
mobility and advance data openness. In the United States, a US House (2020) 
committee recommended rules to prevent di scrimination, favouritism, and self-
preferencing, and to strengthen antitrust la ws and enforcement. In China, meanwhile,

anticompetitive behaviours such as exclus ivity clauses, price discrimination and 
market barriers (Restoy 2021).14  
There could be stability challenges in a barbell outcome with respect to both 
large and small players. As in the tradit ional competition-stability nexus, greater 
franchise values may create incentives for large players to act pr udently and mitigate 
risk (such as those around cyber security, where the expertise of big techs is clear). 
However, systemic importance (too big to fail) may entail pressing risks to financial 
stability. Meanwhile, small, specialized play ers may help to serve specific market 
segments, but their lack of diversificatio n may also mean less stability. The niche 
providers would not have the diversificatio n to survive a demand shock affecting their 
segments, and a specific market segment dependent on only a few niche providers 
could be particularly hard hit when a spec ialized player exits. In  addition, costs to 
authorities to effectively supervise a large numb er of small entities is significant; this 
would be particularly burdensome for many EMDEs.  
Authorities may also need to revisit existing rules on the relationship between 
banking and commercial activities. In some jurisdictions (eg the UK and Japan), it is 
common for non-financial institutions to ow n financial institutions subsidiaries, while 
in others (eg the US) there is an explicit separation between banking and commerce.15 
As the boundaries between digital financial services and other services blur, there 
may be new challenges. For instance, would a big tech that partners with a small bank 
and provides financial services have indirect power to influence lending decisions without having to have an ownership stake? Can cross-subsidization of financial and 
non-financial services introduce systemic risks, either from the “real” or financial side 
of such links? These and fu rther aspects may require additional attention.  
Efficiency and competition vs privacy and consumer protection 
As data become an even more important source of market power, a trade-off 
between efficiency / competit ion and privacy / consumer pr otection arises. This is 
represented by the blue s egment in Graph 12, and has implications for financial 
inclusion and market structure.  
The massive volumes and types of data powering new financial services offerings 
have unique characteristics. On e special aspect of the use of big data as an input to 
production is that data can be used many times and by any number of firms 
simultaneously, without being depleted. This is referred to as “non-rivalry.” Data are 
often generated at zero marginal cost as a by-product of other digital services. Re-
use and exchange of data ca n generate large welfare gain s, but market mechanisms 
may result in re-use and exchange at be low optimal levels (World Bank 2021).  
The control by providers of their customers’ data maintains privacy but can 
reduce competition. The non-rivalry of data  can generate increasing returns for data 
in both scale and scope (Farboodi et al 2019;  Boissay et al 2021). Any single additional 
piece of data (eg payments information or a client’s review on a firm’s product) has 
 
14  Meanwhile, regulatory sandboxes ma y facilitate new entry into the ma rket. Cornelli et al (2020) show 
that in the UK, firms in the regulatory sandbox were able to attract greater funding given lower 
information asymmetries and regulatory costs.  
15  In China, rules stipulate that big techs may only hold a 30% share in financial institutions – hence the 
30% stake of Alibaba in Ant Grou p, and of Tencent in WeBank.   
 
42 BIS Papers No 117
 additional value when it is combined with an  already existing large stock of data. For 
this reason, data are more valuable to big tech firms and other firms with a wide range 
of business lines, giving rise to so-called digital monopolies. Data may thus become 
an “essential facility” in an antitrust sense. Fuelled by big data, algorithmic price discrimination is able to parse the popula tion of potential customers into finer and 
finer subcategories – each matched with a different price. Large multi-product 
providers could in principle capture the entire consumer surplus (Bar-Gill 2019).  
In the absence of privacy concerns, wider sharing of data could in principle be 
more efficient. If markets are competitive, it could be socially desirable to enable data 
sharing with providers able to make better  use of the data, for example as manifested 
by being able to sell a product to the cu stomer and therefore being willing to pay the 
data producer for access. This could incr ease efficiency and personalization and 
enhance competition and financial inclusion. This consideration has been an important driver behind open banking rule s, which allow customers to share their 
data between providers (eg banks and fint echs), and thus suppo rt competition.  
Privacy concerns are valid, however; free sh aring of data can harm individuals. In 
the case of personal data, open access to data can bring im portant costs, as 
individuals value their privac y (Acquisti et al 2019). Bank transaction data can be an 
important input into credit scoring decisi ons, and it can reveal a wide array of 
information about consumers’ preferences, buying habits, location and a host of 
other attributes, particularly when combined with other data sources. Open access to 
personal data can allow for identity theft, reputational  damage and the manipulation 
of behavioural biases to sell consumers products that are not in their interests – to 
name only a few examples (Ru and Schoar  2016). Open access across providers could 
also leave consumers worse off th rough high, personalized prices.
16 In insurance 
markets, greater data could allow for more  granular pricing, thus undermining the 
risk pooling or solidarity function of insurance (IAIS 2017).  
Control over personal data may be subject to market failures. These come about 
as data are non-rival and only partially  excludable (Carrière-Swallow and Haksar 
2019), and due to challenges in obtaining re liably informed consent. This can invite 
too much data sharing (Acemoglu et al 2021) , hoarding of data, too little investment 
in cyber-security, and fragmentation across borders. While it would in principle be 
optimal to define “property rights” over da ta – a decentralized or “Coasian” solution, 
in line with Coase’s classic th eory of property rights (Coase 1960) – this may not be 
easily applied in practice. In particular, large, multi-product institutions may have 
access to types of data that others do no t have, and given returns to scale and scope 
they may be able to bid more  for such data than specialis t providers. Thus, data can 
be the source of further comp etitive distortions. In additi on, consumers cannot always 
fully process available information, and th e information available when they grant 
 
16  In a recent paper Brunnermeier et al. (2020) argue that big data an d machine learning invert adverse 
selection problems. Artificial intelligence allows insu rers to infer many statistical insights from the 
insurance customer and thereby reverses the information advantage from the customer to the insurer. This determines an “inv erse selection.” A customer know s her multiple attributes, but a 
platform and only a platform ca n connect them. Given this comparative advantage, the insurer can 
try to protect its statistical information by offering only a few screening contracts. In this case, forcing the insurance company to reveal its statistical information to the customer can be welfare-improving. 
Their research shows indeed that in a setting with naïve agents that do not perfectly infer statistical 
information from the price of offered contracts, pr ice discrimination significantly boosts insurers’ 
profits.  
 
BIS Papers No 117 43
 ‘consent’ may be incomplete. This could result in consumers over-sharing, or under-
valuing their own data  property rights.  
Given the network effects underlying comp etition, the competitive playing field 
may be levelled more effectively by placin g well-designed limits on  the use of data. 
Introducing some additional rules regarding privacy – while at the same time allowing 
selectively for the sharing of some type s of data – could increase effective 
competition, because the additi on of such limitations on the use of data could curb 
big techs’ exploitation of network effect s. Just as governments have decided that 
certain information – such as gender or pre-existing medi cal conditions – cannot be 
used in the pricing of health insurance contracts, there ma y be a need for legislatures 
to define types of personal da ta that cannot be used in cr edit decisions or other types 
of financial services. Moreover, policies ma y be needed to give individuals greater 
control over their data. Jones and Tonetti (2020) show in a theoretical model that 
endowing individuals with data rights may le ad to outcomes that are close to optimal. 
Design of such policies must also recognize that mandating data sharing could 
reduce incentives to produce high quality da ta, or to provide valuable services that 
depend on the provider monetizing data (World Bank 2021).  
Data mobility requirements may also he lp to mitigate trade-offs. Work on 
consumer data rights in the EU, Australia and Canada are examples of steps in this 
direction. Proposals on data mobility ar e also included in the EU DMA and DSA 
proposals and the UK Digital Competition Ex pert Panel (2019). Making data “portable” 
across providers and increasing data subjects’ control of their data could help to allow 
the efficient uses of data while preventing  data monopolies from arising. While some 
types of data (eg genome data, social cont acts) may still be judged “off-limits” for use 
in financial services, the ability to port permissible data between different providers 
may allow for efficiency an d competition in a way that empowers and benefits 
consumers, reducing rents by providers.  
Beyond data privacy, new entrants ar e often shifting credit, market, and 
operational risks to consumers with limited validation of informed consent or product appropriateness. Marketplace finance platforms were initially designed as a 
regulatory arbitrage, gath ering funds through a non-deposit mechanism to avoid 
being termed a bank. The platforms introduc ed competition to banks, reducing costs 
to borrowers, and offering higher yields to  investors. The increased efficiency of the 
platforms, stems in part from the reduc ed regulatory overhead, minimal required 
capital, and absence of deposit insurance premiums (some P2P platforms do set aside 
funds to self-insure). Investors in many marketplaces have looked at P2P as an 
alternative to bank savings products, but in most cases they bear direct credit risk 
without any type of deposit insurance, an d often are not aware of that risk. Robo-
advisors and gamified trading platforms expo se consumers to market risks from new 
instruments with which they may have limit ed familiarity. Cryptocurrencies have been 
subject to volatility risk that might not be  anticipated by those seeking to use them 
for payments. DLT-based payments embed operational risks with respect to the 
exchanges, and even th e underlying consensus mechanisms, that are not always well 
understood. While Stablecoins seek to addre ss volatility against a pa rticular basket of 
currencies, they fundamentally alter the pr otection for the holder by removing the 
guarantee of redemption at  par that e-money issuer s and banks provide their 
customers. Increased usage of digital me ans of communication between providers 
and customers might expose th e customers to clever social  engineering attacks. The 
increased speed of processing of transactions  affords little or no time to rectify any 
mistakes by customers.  
 
44 BIS Papers No 117
 Regulators need to balance the innovation and efficien cy introduced by broader 
competition with the potential dampening e ffects of consumer pr otection oversight 
and enforcement. Much depends, as with da ta privacy, on whether consent can be 
adequately ‘informed’ and whether there are reliable objective tests for product 
suitability. The challenge of protecting the consumer will become more acute as the 
consumer takes on more direct roles in assembling, and even providing, financial 
services (eg unintermediated P2P). Depending on how the regulatory perimeter is set, 
new approaches to disclosure, determining  product appropriateness, and informed 
consent need to be developed to ensure the promise of increased efficiency does not 
come at the cost of custom er losses and reduced trust. 
Privacy and consumer protection vs financial stability and integrity 
Data sharing can alleviate problems of as ymmetric information and thus could be 
beneficial for financial stability and integrity. This potentially introduces a new trade-
off between privacy (and consumer protec tion more generally) on the one hand and 
financial stability and market integrity on th e other. This trade-off is represented by 
the green segment in Graph 12. 
In the credit market, there is ample eviden ce that more data can improve stability. 
Credit registries (CRs), for instance, can counter adve rse selection and reduce 
information asymmetry between lenders an d borrowers. CRs allow loans to be 
extended to safe borrowers who had prev iously been priced out of the market, 
resulting in higher aggregate lending (Pagano and Jappelli 1993) and furthering 
financial inclusion. They can also counter moral hazard by increasing borrowers’ cost 
of default, thus increasing debt re payment (Padilla and Pagano 2000).17 Conversely, 
sharing of credit-related information has the benefit of reduci ng the information 
monopoly a lender has on its borrowers. For example, banks with long-standing 
relationships with their borrowers have ex clusive information that allows them to 
charge higher interest rates and extract ot her rents from those high-quality borrowers 
(Padilla and Pagano 1997). CR s can counter this. Finally , they can reduce over-
indebtedness by revea ling borrowers’ debt exposure to  all participating lenders, 
leading informed borrowers to extent them less credit (Bennardo, Pagano and Piccolo 
2015). Brown and Zehnder (2007) show that an  information sharing institution helps 
lenders avoid serious losses from short term borrowers. 
As the experience with credit registries shows, this is not without its downsides 
for consumers. In the United  States, for instance, consum er advocates have criticized 
systems that screen for past overdraft fees  and allow banks to deny account services 
to individuals (Baradaran 2015). Transparency in how personal data are used, and 
recourse in the event of misuse, provi de some mitigation for these potential 
exclusionary effects. A large body of r egulations has allowed borrowers to gain 
insights into their personal  credit score and the informat ion collected about them. In 
a world of digital innovation, in which a mu ch wider range of data is available for 
screening, there may be an even higher premium on givi ng individuals such access 
and rights, commensurate with the growing im pact of providers’ use of individuals’ 
data on availability of services.  
 
17  Doblas-Madrid and Minetti (2013) fi nd that if lenders enter a credit  information shar ing institution, 
their borrowers improve their repayment performance – delinquent payments on leases and loans 
decrease.  
 
BIS Papers No 117 45
 For example, there are concer ns that opaque algorithmic processing of personal 
data in banking could result in biases an d discrimination. AI/ML-based credit scoring 
is supposed to reduce the in cidence of non-performing loans, thereby contributing 
to stability. However, sophisticated ML algorithms may not be as neutral as their mathematical nature suggests  at first glance. While less human intervention means 
that taste-based discrimination may dec line, algorithms devel oped by humans or 
trained on historical data can introduce new biases (Morse and Pence 2020). Using 
data on US mortgages, Fuster et al (2019) find that Black and Hispanic borrowers are 
disproportionately less likely to gain from the introduction of machine learning in 
credit scoring models. This suggests that  the algorithm may develop differential 
effects across groups and increase inequa lity (Graph 13, left-hand panel). Borrowers 
to the left of the solid vertical line repres ent “winners,” who are classified as less risky 
by the more sophisticated algorithm than by the traditional model. Based on the 
cumulative share, about 65% of White Non- Hispanic and Asian borrowers would win, 
compared with about 50% of Black and Hispan ic borrowers. In another study, fintech 
does not seem able to close the gender gap in access to financial services, as women 
have a lower propensity to share data than men. Chen et al (2021) find that men are 
more likely to use fintech product services than women (27% vs 19%) and that this 
pattern holds in every country (except for Pe ru and India; Graph 13, right-hand panel). 
Moreover, women report being more worried about their security  when dealing with 
companies online, and less willing to share data  for better offers on financial services.  
Reducing illicit activity is another area wh ere use of personal data can potentially 
improve stability and market integrity, but carry costs in terms of privacy and financial 
exclusion. For example, anti-money laun dering (AML) and comb ating the financing 
of terrorism (CFT) practices require the exch ange of detailed information on all parties 
involved in a financial transaction. This could result in exclusion of individuals who cannot present sufficient docu mentation or have not had prior access to demonstrate 
positive patterns that the screening mechanisms  may seek. The data analysis may 
reveal habits and preferences that are not re lated to illicit activity but are nonetheless 
sensitive or personal. Since sanctions monitoring, KYC remediation, AML measures, 
and transaction monitoring are among the most expensive elements of compliance 
by banks, the motivation to use advanc ed data analytics is  strong. Increased 
automation and use data gener ated at low marginal cost could drive down costs and 
enable more low income customers to be accredited. However, a general raising of 
the bar as data coverage of the more active  and/or high income customers improves 
will exacerbate the data divide relative to  previously excluded segments. Tiered KYC 
requirements attempt to address this as a way of balancing data  coverage and market 
integrity requirements.  
Discussions around central bank digi tal currencies put these issues into 
particularly sharp focus. Some central banks,  such as the People’s Bank of China, are 
considering CBDC architectures in which th e central bank will have full access to 
transactions data so as to support AML/CFT and prudential supervision. Other central 
banks are leaning against having access to such data, and looking into so-called 
“intermediated” options where private sector  intermediaries keep such data and the 
central bank only has a ledger of wholesal e transactions (Auer et al 2020b; Carstens 
2021). Given the stark divergence in prefer ences for privacy-stab ility tradeoffs across 
different jurisdictions, it is possible that fi nal designs may also differ in this regard.  
   
 
46 BIS Papers No 117
 Addressing these trade-offs, too, will r equire a societal discussion on data 
sharing. Data protection rule s like the EU General Data Pr otection Regulation (GDPR) 
and California Consumer Protection Act (CCP A) have represented important steps in 
protecting privacy and limiting data use based on consumer consent. Yet further 
debate will be needed to determine under wh ich circumstances privacy rules may be 
relaxed to improve stability and integrity, and how consumers can be protected from 
algorithmic discrimination. This remains a frontier issue in policymaking in the 
financial sector and the digital economy mo re generally, where di fferent jurisdictions 
may continue learning from one another goin g forward.  
5. Conclusions 
This paper has shown that digital innova tion is bringing about economically 
meaningful changes in the production of fi nancial services, with implications for the 
industrial structure of fi nance. Improvements in connectivity  and computing  can help 
to enhance efficiency and competition. In many cases, financial services have seen an 
un-bundling of different products and services. At the same time, financial frictions  
and forces  that drove the need for financial interm ediators in the first place have re-
asserted themselves. The financial sector may be tending toward a barbell outcome 
in market structure, in which large multi- product institutions exist alongside more 
specialized niche institutions. 
Regulatory and supervisory policy tools w ill have to adapt. Existing regulatory 
perimeters may not adequately cover emergi ng providers of financial services, and 
new players may pose challenges for day- to-day financial supervision. It is 
increasingly challenging to balance compet ition and stability, both among financial 
services providers and across myriad player s in reconfigured financial product value Winners and losers of machine learning credit scoring and the fintech gender gap Graph 13

 chains. Rules for control over data, and whic h data are allowable fo r specific services, 
will need to be defined – ideally in a way th at gives individuals control, balances 
competition and efficiency with privacy and consumer protec tion, and enhances 
financial inclusion. New forms of discrimi nation and bias will need to be understood 
and countered. A new balance will have to be struck across consumer protection, 
privacy considerations and stability and integrity in a way that respects societal 
preferences in different jurisd ictions around the world, and within different societies. 
Monetary policy, systemic stability, and consumer protection tools, which have been 
left largely beyond the scope of this pa per, may also need to adapt. Challenges 
include access to lender of last resort programs by new providers, stabilizing credit 
markets in which non-bank players become major lenders, and maintaining the viability of deposit insurance programs where new players become large.  
Authorities need to be intentional with re spect to market stru cture. Prior notions 
around the trade-offs between competitio n and stability need to be re-examined. 
Longstanding precepts on the separation of banking and commerce are already being 
upended. Existing approaches to competit ion policy and antitrust may not be well-
suited to digital financial services, where measures of pricing and concentration for 
one market or firm may have become less informative. The nature of contestability 
must be understood anew in markets driven by increasing returns to scale but also 
increasingly low entry barriers for niche se rvices. The desirability of a barbell market 
configuration will depend in part on consum er behaviours and skills that determine 
switching costs in a given market. Market forces are already being shaped by 
minimum capital, licensing requirements, activity restrictions and other policies. 
Pretending that market forces are just runni ng their course is inaccurate at best, and 
at worst could lead to negative outcomes for consumers and macro stability.  
Several authorities are taking promising policy measures to mitigate trade-offs. 
Recent entity-based measures around big tech s, such as the proposals in the EU, UK, 
US and China can take a more ex ante approach to addre ss risks, prevent 
anticompetitive behaviours, an d in the process promote a level playing field. Data 
privacy protections and data mobility requir ements can support consumer protection 
and may also promote compet ition. Still, a societal debate will be needed on what 
types of data should be permissible for us e in financial services and when privacy 
rules can be relaxed in the service of stability.  
To tread into this new territory effectively, and to balance the necessary policy 
goals, authorities will need to collaborate. At the domestic level, central banks and 
other financial sector regulators need to c ooperate with industry  regulators (eg for 
telecoms and other utilities that may offer financial services) as well as competition 
and data protection authorities. At the international level, authorities are working together to share expertise on financial regulation of both new entrants and 
incumbents, and to coordinate policies. This becomes ever more important given the 
cross-border spillovers of anti-trust and da ta governance decisions, and the potential 
to improve service efficiency through harm onization of standards in areas such as 
cybercrime prevention, data protection, and interoperability (World Bank 2021). 
Collaboration can help to ensure regulato ry consistency and peer learning between 
countries, and ultimately higher welfare for their populations.

Abstract 
Economic  frictions  such as information asymmetries and economic  forces  such as 
economies of scale and scope give rise to financial intermediaries. These frictions and 
forces also shape market st ructure. While technological advances are not new to 
finance, digital innovation has brought major improvements in connectivity  of 
systems, in computing  power and cost, and in newly created  and usable data. These 
improvements have alleviated transactio n costs and given rise to new business 
models and new entrants. As technology has increased inform ation exchange and 
reduced transaction costs,  the production of financial services could be 
disaggregated. Specialized players have un bundled financial services, allowing 
consumers to find and assemble their prefe rred suites of products. However, classic 
economic forces remain relevant even in an age of digital production. Economies of 
scale and scope and network effects are presen t in many aspects of financial services 
production, including customer acquisition, funding, compliance activities, data and 
capital (including trust capital). Despite advances in technology, consumer search and 
assembly costs remain significant. These forces encourage re-bundling, and confer 
advantages to large multi-product provider s, including technology (big tech) firms 
expanding into financial services from adjace nt markets. The digital transformation of 
financial services gives rise to a set of im portant policy issues regarding competition, 
regulatory perimeters and ensuring a le vel playing field. Potential outcomes 
regarding competition, conc entration and market compos ition include a “barbell” 
outcome composed of a few large providers and many niche players. Authorities must 
coordinate across financial regulation, compet ition, and industry regulatory bodies to 
manage trade-offs between stability and int egrity, competition and efficiency, and 
consumer protection and privacy.

 Executive summary 
Finance is undergoing a profound transforma tion. Digital technologies are reshaping 
payments, lending, insurance and wealth management – a proce ss that the COVID-19 
pandemic has accelerated. While this is ma king financial services in many economies 
more diverse, competitive, efficient, and incl usive, it may also increase concentration 
in markets. Moreover, new risks may arise to  a range of key public policy goals. This 
paper draws on the underlying economics of financial services and their industrial 
organization to examine – with  recent empirical evidence – the implications of digital 
innovation for market structure and attendant policies, including financial and competition regulation. 
The key organizing framework for the discussion is economic  frictions  such as 
information asymmetries and economic  forces  such as economies of scale and scope. 
These frictions and forces give rise to financial intermediaries and shape market 
structure. We show that while technological advances are not new to finance, digital 
innovation has brought ma jor improvements in the connectivity  of systems and in 
computing  power and cost, which have resulted in large volumes of newly created  and 
usable data. For example, mobile phone usage has surged globally, social and 
economic activity has shifted online (oft en to platform-based businesses), and new 
technologies like cloud computing have become widely adopted.  
These improvements have alleviated fr ictions, blurred fi rm and industry 
boundaries, and given rise to new busi ness models. New, often smaller and 
specialized financial technology (fintech ) players have unbundled services (see 
definitions below). However, classic economic forces remain relevant. Economies of 
scale and network effects are strong in di gital platforms and cl oud computing. These 
scale effects, alongside economies of sc ope encourage re-bundling, and allow large 
technology (big tech) firms and other new players to deepen their inroads into core 
financial products. Available evidence shows that big tech firms in particular are 
rapidly expanding their footprin t in finance, and can use big data in ways that reduce 
the need for collateral. Meanwh ile, incumbent financial inst itutions have adapted by 
adopting new technologies and disaggregatin g their production of financial services 
to improve efficiency. 
Digital innovation could drive a range of  industrial organization outcomes. On 
the one hand, digital technology enables ni che providers to reach a target customer 
base and be economically viable. On the ot her hand, customer acquisition, funding, 
“assembly,” and switching costs tend to favo ur larger providers of digital financial 
services. One possibility is a “barbell” ou tcome composed of a few large players and 
many niche players. The large, multi-pr oduct players could include traditional 
financial institutions, fintechs and big techs – thus both incumbents and new entrants. 
Small players may include fintechs as we ll as geographically or sector focused 
incumbents.  
While a ‘‘barbell’’ is not the only potential outcome, it is a central case given the 
economic forces at work. It is a potentia l steady-state market structure as some 
participants leverage scale economies and network effects to grow larger, while 
innovation continues to result in new entrants. There will be a tendency for players to 
either hyper-focus or to aim for the large,  multi-product space. However, continued 
atomization, stalled re-aggregation, or lim its on entry could result in a different 
configuration.

 This analysis gives rise to importan t policy issues regarding competition, 
regulatory perimeters, and ensuring a leve l playing field. Concentration risks may 
increase in the provision of financial servic es to end-users, and in the provision of 
infrastructure to financial institutions. Ma rket structures that concentrate data and 
supercharge network effects could redu ce intermediation costs and broaden 
inclusion. In many markets, however, the resulting market power might be seen as 
detrimental. Competition regulators will have to strike a balance appropriate to the needs of their markets, since different soci eties will attach diffe rent preferences to 
market structure outcomes.  
At the same time, financial regulatory authorities are working to manage policy 
trade-offs among (i) stability and integrity, (ii) competition and efficiency, and (iii) 
consumer protection and priv acy. The barbell outcome, for example, could present 
challenges in terms of stability with respect to both large and small payers. Widespread access to data ra ises privacy concer ns. Regulators need to balance the 
innovation and efficiency br ought by new entrants with the potential challenges for 
oversight, enforcement and consumer protec tion. Emerging policy approaches – such 
as new anti-trust rules for the digital era, data mobility requirements and data 
protection laws – may help to mitigate th e policy trade-offs. Yet the responsibility for 
these changes generally lies with different public authorities, and with legislatures. To 
navigate this new territory effectively, and to balance the necessary policy goals, 
authorities will need to collaborate. This w ill need to occur both domestically – with 
cooperation between central banks, financ ial sector regulators, other industry 
regulators, and compet ition and data protection auth orities – and across borders. 
Such collaboration can help to ensure regula tory consistency and peer learning within 
and between countries, and ultimately bette r development outcomes for the country.  
 Definitions of key terms used in this paper 
Digital financial services (DFS) are financial services whic h rely on digital technologies for their delivery and use by 
consumers.  
Fintech refers to digital technologies that have the pote ntial to transform the provision of financial services 
spurring the development of new – or modify existing – business models, app lications, processes,  and products. In 
practice, the term “fintech” is also broadly used to denote the ongoing wa v e  o f  n e w  D F S .  E x a m p l e s  o f  t h e s e  
technologies include web, mobile, cloud services, machine learning, digital ID, and application prog ramming interfaces 
(APIs).  
A fintech firm is one that specializes in offering DFS to consumers, or enables other pr oviders to offer DFS. While 
many of these companies are relatively  new to the financial sector, others  are by now well-established public 
companies. Examples of fintechs incl ude digital payment providers  (eg PayPal), financial infrastructure/connectivity 
providers (eg Plaid), digital insurers (eg BIMA, Policy Baz aar), peer-to-peer lending platforms (eg Afluenta, Funding 
Circle, Investree).  
A big tech firm is a large company whose primary activity  is digital services. Examples of big techs include online 
search engines, social media platforms, e-commerce platform s, ride-hailing platforms, and mobile network operators. 
Numerous big techs have started to o ffer DFS, leveraging their large customer bases and the data they have on 
transactions and activities that give ri se to payments or a need for credit, insurance or other financial services.

 1. Introduction 
Digital innovation is transforming financial services. Innovations in financial 
technology such as mobile money, peer-to- peer (P2P) or marketplace lending, robo-
advice, insurance technology  (insurtech) and crypto-asse ts have emerged around the 
world.2 In the past decade, fintech has al ready driven greater access to and 
convenience of financial services for retail users. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud services, and distributed ledger tech nology (DLT) are tran sforming wholesale 
markets in areas as diverse as financial ma rket trading and regula tory and supervisory 
technology (regtech and suptech). A host of new firms have sprung up to apply new technologies to meet cust omer demand and most incumben ts indicate that digital 
transformation is a strategic priority (F eyen et al 2021). Indeed, leading banks are 
rapidly closing gaps in digitization of inte rnal processes and cust omer offerings, to 
compete with fintechs and th e large technology (big tech) firms that have also 
entered the fray (BIS 2019; Frost et al 2019). 
These developments have the potentia l to make markets more diverse, 
competitive, efficient, and in clusive, but could also increase concentration. Innovation 
has introduced competition and increased inclusion, particularly in emerging markets 
and developing economies (Pazar basioglu et al 2020; Frost et al 2021). Fintech seems 
to have thrived particularly in markets where the financial system had been less 
developed (FSB 2020; Didier et al 2021). However, the underlying economics of 
intermediation combined with new technology may lead to concentration among both traditional and new financial serv ices providers. Monopolistic or anti-
competitive behaviours by big technology pl atforms are already being scrutinized. As 
financial services move towards similar te chnology-driven configurations, regulators 
are grappling with questions of how best to  regulate and supervise a landscape that 
is increasingly characterized by new pl ayers and business models; and to address 
potential challenges to financial stability, financial integrity, fair competition, and 
consumer protection (including data privacy).  
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated th e digital transformati on. In particular, 
the need for digital connectivity to replac e physical interactio ns between consumers 
and providers, and in the processes that produce financial services, will be even more important as economies, financial services providers, businesses and individuals 
navigate the pandemic and the eventual post-COVID-19 world. For instance, the 
pandemic has already accelerated the shift to  digital payments (Aue r et al 2020a). It 
has also intensified e-commerce (BIS 2020; Alfonso et al 2021), which may benefit big 
tech firms and their activities in financ e. Countries with more stringent COVID-19 
policies and lower community mobility experienced a larger increase in financial app downloads in the wake of the outbreak (Did ier et al 2021). Finally, it may be speeding

This paper examines the implications of digital innovation for market structure 
and attendant policies, including financial and competition regulation. There have 
been a number of surveys of regulatory responses. This paper takes a step back, to 
look at what the economic th eory of banking and financial intermediation can tell us 
about how technology may drive industrial organization in the sector, and how that 
might inform further policy responses. Th e paper roots the impa ct of the digital

 transformation of finance in how innovati on has enabled provi ders to address long-
standing challenges of financial intermedia tion – including asymmetric information, 
uncertainty, incomplete markets, and fix ed and variable costs of production. The 
paper describes how digital innovation affect s these key economic frictions in finance, 
and alters the financial services value chai n and industrial organization. The forces 
driving these changes, an d potential outcomes in terms of industry structure, lead to 
insights for policy makers on how to harness the benefits of fintech, while mitigating 
some of the risks, particularly around comp etition and market stru cture. The focus is 
on economic and techno logical forces that apply broadly across financial services. It 
recognizes that the sector  encompasses a wide range of  different products and 
services, and is composed of numerous sub-markets that might use different 
technologies or have different economic stru ctures. These may thus  diverge in market 
structure and competition outcomes.  
2. Economic frictions and forces in financial services 
Fundamentally, financial firms, like other fi rms, owe their existence to transaction 
costs (Baltensperger 1980). In the absence of  complete trust between parties, market 
interactions on the producti on side and the customer side are characterized by risks, 
due eg to principal-agent ch allenges and incomplete or asymmetric information. 
Solving these to reduce risk and create tr ust imposes costs on both institutions and 
consumers, including contracting, search, an d verification costs. For example, lending 
is characterized by information asymmetries ex ante , as lenders need to determine 
the risk profile of potential borrowers, and ex post , as they need to monitor the 
repayment capacity of borrowers (Dewatri point and Tirole 1994). A fundamental 
feature of payment markets is  the need to keep track of payment obligations, and to 
verify the identity of account holders or the veracity of payment tokens (Kahn and 
Roberds 2009). Different actors in the paym ent processing chain must trust that the 
other links will not expose them to fraud or liability, and customers require 
trustworthy counterpar ties with which to lodge funds and reliable processes for their 
delivery. Financial market investment and in surance are subject to uncertainty around 
future outcomes, adverse selection, and moral hazard. Those creating investment 
products rely on sound underwriting and ex ecution services to be able to offer a 
quality product to their customers. Customers in turn must be able to trust the 
soundness of the investments and of the operations that underlie their ability to buy 
and sell.  
As in other industries, internalization of ac tivities within a single financial services 
firm overcomes principal-agent and asymme tric information challenges, to align 
interests and monitor actions. This ensures trusted interactions across teams. Linking 
deposit taking to lending enables close coordination of asset and liability 
management. Combining payments executio n with account management allows the 
provider to confirm availability of funds before transfer instructions are carried out. Linking underwriting, trading, and sales allows firms to design new investment products in line with market cond itions and investor preferences. 
The presence of uncertainty about fu ture outcomes, for example whether a 
borrower will go bankrupt, adds  further frictions. Because it is difficult to define a 
contract for all potential future states of the world – and the resu lting solvency status 
of the borrower – markets are not complete in the Arrow-Debreu (1954) sense. As a  
 
BIS Papers No 117 3
 result, resource allocations may be inefficien t: some borrowers will have to pay higher 
interest rates to compensate the lender for expected (but not necessarily realized) 
losses, costly insurance may be required, or  some loans will not be made at all. More 
generally, the difficulty of tailoring products  to the precise circumstances of different 
customers, due either to as ymmetric information or uncertainty about outcomes, 
means that pricing, maturity, or other terms will inevitably be less than perfectly suited 
to the circumstances of some clients. The y may decline the offer,  or the intermediary 
may deem certain segments unviable commerc ially. Either way, some customers will 
not be served.  
Financial services companies are struct ured to address particular information 
gaps and frictions related to  intermediation. Banks develop ed to address the maturity 
transformation challenge resulting from incomplete information about future 
liquidity needs of depositors. They also address the transactio nal costs and risk 
management needs of intermedi ating investments across individuals who lack direct 
knowledge of other counterparties or info rmation about economic activities taking 
place elsewhere. Banks divers ify across large numbers of borrowers to better manage 
uncertainty of outcomes. Exchanges and br okers address the sear ch and transaction 
costs of individual issuers and investors, reducing information asymmetries through 
listing requirements and publishing prices, and providing infrastr ucture and services 
to match and enable transactions between buyers and sellers who don’t know each 
other. Because so much of the intermedi ation process is not readily visible to 
customers, and risks may only  be realized after an extended period of time, the 
consumer need for trusted providers manife sts more than in other industries. A 
provider that gains cu stomer trust with one product can leverage that trust to offer 
other services. 
Providing these services requir es not only information and financial  resources, 
but also real resources. These include the la bour, equipment, and premises to 
produce financial contracts, manage accounts, and process customer transactions. 
The mix of labour, physical capital, financ ial capital, and trust capital will vary by 
business type, and has been  rapidly changing. Nevertheless, financial services 
production is subject, in varying degrees, to the same frictions that  affect production 
in other industries, including real resource  indivisibility and fix ed costs. Thus, while 
financial intermediation is subject to unique  information and transaction frictions, as 
an industry it is also subject to familiar economic forces observed across sectors.  
Basic economic forces are at play across  both the financial and real resources 
deployed by financial firms. These include: 
• Economies of scale.  On the supply side, traditional financial firms have had large 
fixed cost investment needs for the cr eation and maintenance of back-office 
systems and physical distribution networ ks to connect to the consumer. There 
may also be fixed costs of minimum capital requirements  and regulatory 
compliance operations. As in any industry  with fixed costs, economies of scale 
emerge when a larger producer can amorti ze those costs over a larger customer 
base. Scale also permits the development of  a diversified balance sheet to better 
manage liquidity and credit risk. Scale can re duce the marginal cost of risk-taking 
(Mester 2010) and allow better pricing an d/or ability to serve a wider range of 
customers.  
• Economies of scope.  Also on the supply side, financial intermediaries enjoy 
economies of scope by bundling interdep endent financial services that can be 
delivered through the same physical customer interfac es and leverage the same  
 
4 BIS Papers No 117
 balance sheet. Cross-selling loan products and insurance, and offering both asset 
and liability products, can create synergies and reduce costs. Economies of scope 
are further enforced by the demand side as many customers prefer a 
conveniently offered suite of products. This  also reinforces the institution’s role 
of gatekeeper to the customer.  
• Network effects.  On the demand side, network e ffects (or “externalities”) are 
significant in financial services such as  payments, where the value of the network 
to all users (both payers and payees) in creases when the nu mber of connected 
users increases. A bank serving a business, suppliers and as well as its customers, 
could more efficiently connect counterpar ties to quickly transfer payments and 
provide working capital.  
Given the available technology and prev ailing regulation, these forces have 
historically conferred advantages to “first movers” and large, vertically and horizontally integrated players.  This has been particularly  true for capital-intensive 
products such as lending, for institutions that put consumers’ savings at risk such as 
deposit taking, and for capital and networ k-intensive areas such as payments.  
2.1 The Impact of digital innov ation on key economic frictions 
The adoption of technology is not new in the financial sector, but a number of 
constraints had defined the operating enviro nment until recently. In the late 20th 
century, the industry was already charac terized by a relatively high degree of 
computerization since most financial services were dematerialized.3 Only payments 
frequently required physical ca sh or a check, and onboarding for new products and 
services often required in-person or paper-based processes. Still, reaching and connecting to customers routinely required ph ysical infrastructure such as branches 
and automated teller machines (ATMs). Customers wishing to transact with 
counterparties using other banks had to us e expensive and sometimes slow or risky 
processes such as wire transfers. Even af ter the advent of digital payment systems 
and the dematerialization of se curities, connectivity remain ed a barrier to entry – an 
institution typically had to be licensed an d part of the consortium of banks or 
brokerage houses to participate in a tr ansactional network. Furthermore, data 
processing and storage were expensive,  requiring the operation of bespoke 
mainframes and data centres. This limited the volume of information that could be 
gathered, stored, analysed, and exchanged to improve e fficiency, better price risk, 
and tailor products to customer needs. 
Technology advances in connectivity, data processing, and storage 
Significant technology advances have taken place in two key areas that have contributed to the cu rrent wave of technology-based finance:  
• Increased connectivity. Inte rnet and mobile technology  have rapidly increased 
the ability to transfer information and interact remotely, both between 
businesses and directly to the consumer. Through mobile and smartphones, 
which are near-ubiquitous, technology ha s increased access to, and the efficiency 
of, direct delivery channels and promises  lower-cost, tailored financial services. 
 
3  This included data centres, front and back-office connectivity to core banking systems, branch 
automation, and interoperable payments networks co nnecting financial firms, including wire services, 
automated clearing houses (ACH), and ATM networks.

 As of late 2019, GSMA estimated that there were more than 5 billion mobile 
subscriptions worldwide. Building on this user base, there were nearly one billion 
registered mobile money accoun ts (Graph 1). In principle, most financial services 
can be now delivered directly and digitally , vastly increasing access to finance. 
An emerging class of services and assets  could in principle even be delivered 
without the need for an intermediary. At the same time, the rapid increase in 
connectivity has enabled large network e ffects and strengthen ed the position of 
established intermediaries offering mobile  networks and subscriptions, such as 
telecom companies, particularly in some emerging market and developing 
economies (EMDEs). Furthermore, the de velopment of widely used applications 
and services like social media, search and social communication have enabled 
more peer-to-peer casual interactions. These are increasingly being tapped for 
economic interactions, as well. This has strengthened the position of the companies providing these services. 
• Low-cost computing and data stora ge. Computing efficiency has risen 
exponentially, as the cost of data stor age has rapidly declined. The Cray-1 was 
the world’s fastest “supercomputer” fr om 1976-1982, operating at 80 MHz, 
weighing 5.5 tons, an d costing $10 million.
4 The A11 chip powering an iPhone X 
runs at a speed of 2.39 GHz – 30 times faster  – and at a small fraction of the size 
and cost.5 Data that required a room  full of tape or hard drives in 1980 can fit on 
a micro secure digital (SD) card today. As the cost of data storage has fallen, from 
USD 0.11 per gigabyte in 2009 to 0.02 in 2020, the volume of data being 
generated globally has increa sed exponentially – to an estimated 48 zettabytes 
(48 trillion gigabytes) in 2020 (Graph 2). The ability to process such data rapidly 
has also risen with advances in artifici al intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
(FSB 2017). Digital technologies like smartp hones, and activities like social media 
and e-commerce generate a wealth of new data. Much of the new data relates 
to individuals (“personal data”) or firm s, and can be processed automatically to

 identify the characteristics of existing or  potential clients and offer the financial 
services that best fit them. 
Data, networks, and new business models 
These advances have enabled the creation of huge amount s of capturable data, new 
tools to analyse those data, and new busi ness models leveraging insights from the 
analysis. Connectivity generates and captures  a variety of data, and digitalization of 
more activities generates higher  volumes of data at an ev en greater velocity. Storage 
and processing capacity a llows data to be organiz ed, validated, and analysed, 
including through computationally intensive techniques such as AI, including 
machine learning applications on vast troves of data. Digitally “native” data with high 
volume, variety, velocity and veraci ty are referred to as “Big Data.”6 These 
characteristics mean that  not only did big data emerge  due to increased digitization 
of activities (including those facilitated by connectivity), but big data also requires  low 
cost storage and high capaci ty computing power to be us eful. Big data emerges from 
a variety of sources, including the location  and usage data from mobile phones, the 
contact information from social networks , the delivery information from logistics 
companies, and the sales data from retail ou tlets and payments networks. Big data is 
being used in a wide range of traditiona l financial services and new types of 
businesses to improve credit analysis, pr ocess efficiency, risk  management, product 
design, customer service and other areas. Examples include Trus ting Social, which 
uses call records to develop credit scores , and Tenda Pago, which uses retailers’ 
consumer goods order information as a basi s for working capital loans. Data can be 
an important resource for, and driver of , economic development (World Bank 2021).

 These advances also enable a number of  new business models for the provision 
of technology, one of which is cloud-bas ed computing. This combines the ability of 
an enterprise or individual  to connect to externally  operated and managed data 
centres with low-cost computing power and st orage. The result is an ability to obtain 
infrastructure on demand and r educe the fixed cost barrier to entry to offer financial 
services. Surveys show  that cloud adoption has proc eeded rapidly. For instance, in 
Europe, Eurostat estimates that over half of  enterprises in the Nordic countries used 
cloud storage in 2018, while firms in the Neth erlands, Ireland, UK and Malta have also 
seen rapid adoption (Graph 3). Recent ev idence suggests that cloud adoption has 
even accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic (McKinsey 2020). For instance, a 
recent survey of IT leaders from 250 mi d-sized companies around the world found 
that 82% of respondents increased cloud us age as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and 91% are planning a more strategic us e of cloud in the near future (Snow 
2020). Innovation in cloud services is pr oceeding apace, as growing volumes of 
venture capital and private equity funding have flown into new applications of cloud 
technology and development operations (DevOps) over the past three years 
(Graph 4). 
Another result of the technology adva nces described above has been the wide 
emergence of platform-based business models. Fintechs, big techs and even some 
incumbents have moved increasingly to a role as “matchmakers” between different 
users and providers on their platforms (Croxso n et al 2021). These businesses leverage 
the connectivity of individuals and businesses, and the ability to quickly and easily 
collaborate, discover counterparties, and pa ckage and deliver a range of digital and 
physical goods and services. Platforms are two-sided or multi-sided markets, and 
benefit from network effects that create  more value for each participant with 
increased numbers of other participants.

 The platform provider also  benefits from the networ k effects that attract more 
users, transaction volumes from which to earn  revenues, and data th at in turn enables 
the provider to target users with more g oods or services. The ability to connect large 
numbers of users to a wide array of services  has led to the rise of so-called ‘super 
apps’ such as WeChat, AliPay, and (perha ps) Facebook. These and other technology 
companies operating platforms with large customer bases are often referred to as big 
techs (Frost et al 2019). For this analysis , almost any large company that has or can 
leverage big data against a large customer base could become a big tech. Examples 
include telecom providers like Vodafone M-Pe sa, and retailers such as Walmart, which 
is already a substantial e-commerce player and in early 2021 announced intentions 
to create a fintech operation. It could al so include business-to-business (B2B) players 
such as consumer goods manufacturers and distributors. Among other features, 
platform operators can leverage digita l delivery channels and application 
programming interfaces (APIs) to seamle ssly “embed” financial services such as 
payments or loans into non-financial services  such as e-commerce or social media.  
Network effects in these business models can lead to market concentration and 
competition concerns. The effect of adding  users on one side of a platform market 
(ride-hailing drivers, for example), creating  more value to users on the other side 
(riders), and therefore becomi ng more attractive to users on the first side (drivers), 
can result in a positive growth spiral and a “winner-takes-all” or  “winner-takes-most” 
outcome, where all market participants want to be on the same platform. There is the 
risk that a platform that builds a dominant  market position woul d extract rents from 
its massive data and networks (Croxson et  al 2021). The multi-sided nature of the 
market, however, makes it difficult to define  the relevant market interactions, such as 
product tying, for competition analysis . Furthermore, multi-sided markets are 
characterized by complex pricing structures , including asymmetric pricing that more 
finely divides the consumer surplus amongst participants. Pricing practices that could 
be considered anti-competit ive in one-sided markets migh t be pro-competitive in a 
multi-sided market by attracting more part icipants and increasi ng welfare-enhancing 
network effects (White et al 2018). The imp lications of these aspects for financial Investment in CloudTech and DevOps companies1 Graph 4

below.  
Impact on transaction costs, informa tion asymmetries, and market gaps 
Through the advances in connectivity and computing, digital i nnovation helps to 
alleviate transaction costs and enable a wide range of new financial services business 
models. Adoption cuts across traditional an d new providers. Digital technologies can 
help reduce the costs of collecting, storin g, processing, and ex changing information 
– including search costs, replication costs,  tracking costs, and verification costs 
(Goldfarb and Tucker 2019). In  finance, this can help borrowers to more quickly find 
a suitable offer on a loan, or help savers to find an investment product that suits their specific needs. Technologies can also help parties to automate verification of events, 
enabling the creation of a wider range of state-contingent produc ts. For instance, an 
insurance client may use a phone camera or other remote device to document 
damage that results in an insurance claim, or  a drone may verify that a field has been 
planted to enable disbursement of an agricu ltural loan. Blockchain technologies take 
these a level further by providing a set of underlying capabilities making it easier for 
individuals and businesses to interact on a peer-to-peer basis even when they do not 
know each other beforehand (trustless context). At the limit, such advances may 
obviate the need for intermediation, by enab ling individuals or firms – such as the 
lenders and borrowers in P2P and private credit markets – to  interact directly without 
the need for a bank to aggregate fund s, assess credit, and provide ongoing 
monitoring and servicing functions.  
Incumbents, fintech entrants, and big tech s are leveraging technology to address 
economic frictions. They can close info rmation gaps (asymm etric information, 
uncertainty), and cut costs by:  
• Reducing information asymmetries. Cla ssic theories of intermediation describe 
how banks address information asymme tries between borrowers and lenders 
(Aghion and Bolton 1997; Holmström and Tirole 1997). They also discuss how 
residual gaps increase credit  costs or restrict the supply of credit, both in terms 
of interest rates and the costs of ancillary activities such as attaching collateral. 
Better information, for example leveragi ng consumer data and analytics, could 
improve risk assessment and reduce the need for collateral as  an indicator of 
creditworthiness in lending (Gambacorta et al 2020; see Box A). The use of vast 
troves of data enables the provision of financial services to individuals and small 
businesses with no or limited traditional credit history, promoting financial inclusion. More information and greater transparency tend to increase trust, 
enabling providers and users of fund s to work with a wider range of 
counterparties. With enough transpar ency between users of finance and 
providers of funds, intermediation itse lf may not be necessary. For example, 
fintech credit models such as P2P or mark etplace lending seek  to directly link 
investors and borrowers (Claessens et al 2018).

 • Enabling customization of financial servic es to construct more complete markets. 
Data and automation facilitate the execution and monitoring of complex 
contracts and creation of more complete  markets. This could bring financial 
services closer to the stylized general equilibrium of the classic Arrow-Debreu 
(1954) model. Traditional core banking systems and marketing channels were 
built around standardized products, and did not facilitate a fully consumer-
centric approach to product development and marketing. More tailored services, 
such as loans, investment advice, or retirement planning structured to take 
account of the individual circumstan ces of the borrower across different 
outcomes and states of the world, requir ed highly trained and expensive experts. 
In contrast, fintech-enabl ed automation of processes reduces the set-up costs 
for customized products and can track different contingencies across a wide 
range of outcomes. Digital marketing syst ems enable specialized products to find 
a sufficient customer base. The increased availability of data and computing 
power makes it possible to better price risk, tailor a product or service to the 
needs of the consumer, and potentially construct a range of  state-contingent 
products, executed and monitored throug h smart contracts or other emerging 
technologies. 
• Reducing fixed and marginal costs of pr oducing financial services. Technology 
has reduced the costs of, and need for, much of th e traditional physical 
infrastructure that drove fixed costs for th e direct financial services provider. An 
early example that has been particularly important in EMDEs is mobile money. Mobile money has reduced the need for tr aditional bank branches and payments 
acceptance infrastructure, eg point of sale (POS) terminals, and has become a 
widely used alternative to bank accounts in some countries. Cloud-based 
infrastructure, including Banking-as-a -Service (BaaS), provides computing 
power, data storage, and even complianc e services. A niche financial services 
provider can connect to these services and purchase as much capacity as it 
requires on demand without the need to build data ce ntres and other back-office 
infrastructure (or, in the case of BaaS, a license).
7 Financial intermediaries can 
reduce marginal costs through techno logy-enabled automation and “straight-
through” processing, which are accelerating with the expanded use of data and 
AI-based processes. Digital innovation can also help to overcome spatial 
(geographical) barriers, and even to brid ge differences across legal jurisdictions 
(akin to processes discussed by Bodie and Merton 2005). The increased use of 
digital tools and platforms for a range of economic activities makes it possible 
to embed tailored financial products into non-financial activities, drastically 
reducing customer acquisition costs and risks. Contextualized finance will be 
discussed further below.   
 
7  While branch fixed costs may be eliminated by direct connectivity to customers, technology fixed 
cost has been variabilized at the level of the financ ial services provider but remains a high fixed cost 
offering from the technology provider(s). The rele vant market for tech infrastructure shifts from 
financial services to IT/cloud serv ices. The resulting market concentration issues are addressed below.

 • Reducing search and switch ing costs for consumers. Ad vances in connectivity 
and online search mean finding and using a financial services provider in the next 
state or province – or across the globe – can be as easy as finding one in the Box A 
Data and collateral 
Banks usually require borrowers to pledge tangible assets, su ch as real estate, to help offset asymmetric information 
problems. Collateral performs several func tions: it can indicate creditworthiness, to the extent that having accumulated 
the means to possess a tangible asset signals something abou t ability to repay a loan; it provides an alternative means 
to recover the loan in case the borrower becomes unable to repay; and it aligns interests because the potential loss 
of the collateral would be costly for a borrower who become s unwilling to repay. By contrast, big techs can use big 
data to better assess firms’ creditworthi ness. They can link repayment performanc e to other sources of value, such as 
access to new inventory or to an e-commerce platform to sell goods. These capabilities could help to reduce the 
importance of collateral in solving asymmetric information problems and maintaining alignment of interests. 
Gambacorta et al (2020) compare how credit from a big tech firm (Ant Group) and traditional bank lending 
correlate with local economic activity, house prices, and firm-specific characteri stics. Using a unique random sample 
of more than 2 million Chinese firms, the paper finds that big tech credit does not correlate with local business 
conditions and house prices when controlling for demand factors. 
Graph A1 indicates the unconditional elas ticity between the differe nt credit forms and house price. The dots in 
the figures indicate the average logarith m credit use (y-axis) and the average logarithm of housing price (x-axis) at 
the city-year level. The left-hand panel plots big tech cred it, the middle panel plots bank secured credit (mortgages) 
and the right-hand panel plots bank unsec ured credit. Linear trend lines are repo rted in each graph, together with

of unsecured bank credit is twice as high (0.184). That of se cured bank credit is five time s higher (0.488). A greater use 
of big tech credit could therefore have macroeconomic imp lications, weakening the relevanc e of the collateral channel.

 same city. On the consumer side, the marg inal cost of using multiple financial 
service providers is also reduced. Techno logies have become increasingly plug-
and-play, from the advent of common internet communications protocols and 
mark-up languages, to “open banking” and standardized APIs that facilitate data 
access and exchange. Increased access to  information about remote providers 
and their products and pric es reduces search costs fo r users. The reduction in 
search and switching costs thus applie s both to providers and individual 
customers. For example, a customer can now choose a start-up remittance 
service provider offering lower fees an d ready connectivity to the customer’s 
bank account, or an established soci al media company that already has the 
customer’s trust and connectivity to friends and family to whom remittances are 
sent. Reduced search costs could eventu ally enable those who need finance to 
connect directly to those wi th excess funds to invest, with smart loan contracts 
replacing the monitoring prov ided by intermediaries. Lo wer search, on-boarding, 
and switching costs could make  markets more competitive.  
Despite reduced costs, incr eased efficiency, and all th e new data and computing 
power available, fintech remains subject to  the same risks traditionally present in 
finance. Credit, liquidity, market, and operat ional risks can be reduced or transferred, 
but not eliminated completely. Market failures can result in financial instability, speculative bubbles, domino effects and, po tentially, systemic risks (Frost 2020). In 
most markets digital finance has not reached levels at which it presents systemic risk, 
but as fintech and big tech finance grow, and traditional banks use similar technologies to a greater degree, that will shift. P2P lending in China reached 
significant volumes before the regulatory crackdown began in 2017. This culminated 
in the November 2019 requirement that all platforms close or convert to regulated 
small loan providers within two years. P2P lending in China and the more recent Wirecard failure in Germany offer lessons on  the need for approp riate regulation and 
supervision of fintech. Big tech firms may already have reached the level of systemic 
importance (too-big-to-fail) in some econ omies, notably in China. Authorities are 
actively formulating appropriate regulatory  responses to these risks (see Section 4). 
The digital transformation of  finance also introduces – or heightens – cyber risks. 
Cybersecurity is an issue for all sectors and for traditional financial services providers 
as well as fintechs and big techs. The attack surface is broadening, however, as 
interconnectivity increases an d the disaggregation of serv ices introduces more links 
to each product chain and user interface. These factors can also increase operational 
risks as a greater number of distinct enti ties may be involved in the provision of a 
single product or service, creating comp lex webs of operational dependency. These 
risks may have increased further during the COVID-19 pandemic (Aldasoro et al 
2021). At the same time, certain core services have become more concentrated (eg 
provision of cloud services), creating the po tential that single points of failure could 
result in systemic disruption.  
Finally, there are new risks to privacy an d consumer protection . The proliferation 
of providers and tailored services, reachi ng new customers and embedding financial 
products into other activities, increase th e risks of compromising privacy, abusive 
practices or errors by unaware consumers.  Consumer protection and regulation of 
risks arising from fintech and digital transfor mation are addressed in other papers in 
the forthcoming Future  of Finance series.

 2.2 Consequences for financial services firms 
The financial services value chain consis ts of four broad components: customer 
interface, back-office function s, infrastructure, and balanc e sheet. The operations that 
‘manufacture’ financial services involve the fi rst three of these. Th e theory of the firm 
in economics highlights transactions costs as a key determinant of whether a given process or interaction will be mediated thro ugh the market or within a firm (Coase 
1937; Williamson 1971). Prior to the advent of fintech, the combination of transactions 
costs and economies of scale and scope resu lted in large financial intermediaries that 
tended to be vertically and horizontally integrated, providing all four components 
(and multitudes of subcomponents) internally. 
i. Customer interface. This consists of ph ysical networks such as branches, ATMs, 
and points-of-sale to distribute core financial products and services. In the past, 
customers needed to be physic ally present to co nduct activities such as opening 
an account, buying a product, making a transaction, and getting advice. In many cases, these activities were paper-bas ed and cumbersome. Al though the advent 
of the internet gave rise to online and mobile banking, these were again owned 
and operated by a particular financial institution. As a result, financial institutions largely remained as gatekeepers  to the consumer with a basic bank account being 
the pre-condition to participate in the economy and acquire additional financial 
services. As a result, financial institutions were also able to tap into a highly regulated, but sticky and cheap source of funding: retail deposits. 
ii. Back and middle office. This consists  of all the departments, processes, and 
internal systems to operate the bank’s  products and balance sheets. These 
functions include risk management, r egulatory compliance, credit decisions, 
fraud detection, call centres, trade re conciliation, technology operations, and 
record keeping. Prior to the advent of fintech, these processes involved manual 
and paper-based intervention and requ ired cross-departmental coordination. 
Organizational complexity and siloed legacy IT systems further increased 
transaction costs, left customer data unexploit ed, impeded the ability to 
innovate, and degraded customer experiences. 
iii. Infrastructure. This connects individual financial sector participants (including the 
central bank) to collectively comprise the financial system. This includes payment 
and settlement systems (r etail and wholesale) as well as other financial 
infrastructures such as credit inform ation bureaus and ar rangements that 
facilitate transactions across cross-border s. Many of these infrastructures still 
face inefficiencies due to, for ex ample, limited operating hours and 
interoperability constraints. Further, unt il recently, non-banks typically could not 
access these infrastructures directly an d were therefore reliant on banks. 
iv. Balance sheet. Deploying customer deposits (or other sources of funds) into 
productive loans (and other uses of funds) through balance sheet intermediation 
is one of the oldest functions in financ e. A modern balance sheet serves more 
complex functions and is optimized to attr act a mix of retail and wholesale funds, 
to match assets and liabilities across multiple dimensions (tenor, currency, etc.) 
and to maintain adequate capital and liqui dity levels. Balance sheets of regulated 
financial institutions are subject to a va riety of requirements and constraints. 
Certain types of financial institutions – eg payment service providers, mutual fund 
managers, and more recently P2P or marketplace lenders – do not create 
customer liabilities and assets on their own balance sheets. Nevertheless, balance  
 
14 BIS Papers No 117
 sheet finance remains dominant in most EMDEs. Even in advanced economies, 
assets that are ultimately  funded through capital ma rkets are often originated 
on-balance sheet before being securiti zed or sold to a ‘shadow bank.’  
As technology has reduced transaction costs, the boundaries of the firm have 
changed and the production ch ain for financial services could be more disaggregated 
(vertical disintegration). This has been taki ng place for decades; an  example is the use 
of third-party ATM and card networks to process bankin g withdrawals or payments 
transactions. First, the ATM moved the tr ansaction outside the bank branch. Then, 
connectivity and information transfer tech nologies enabled different companies to 
provide elements of the tr ansaction value chain – an issuing bank, a merchant 
processor operating a POS terminal, and a network operator. As a result, the 
customer-facing bank could focus on its core competencies and customers. With 
advances in technology, this process has acce lerated. There is an increasing array of 
products and services that can be sourced from multiple different providers, 
combined, and offered to the customer as an integrated whole. The customer-facing 
provider might incorporate features and func tions from external vendors, outsourcing 
providers, or partners. Examples include us ing third-party sales agents or internet 
marketplace originators, external credit scoring services, outs ourced card issuer 
processing, and white-label integration of fintech services.  
Advances in information and connectivity have also led to an unbundling of 
financial services consumption (horizontal disintegration). Customers now have more 
information about different providers and an increased ability to interact across 
providers, so they can choose  different providers for the different financial products 
they use. Similarly, providers have more access to information about new or potential 
customers, can market to them better, and ca n offer services directly. The availability 
of data also makes it easier for provider s to underwrite a cust omer without having 
had a prior relationship, so the inherent competitive advantage of a single provider 
in offering additional products is diminish ed. Services that were once consumed from 
one financial institution can be offered by a wide range of specialized firms. Examples 
in both personal and busi ness banking underscore th is unbundling (Graph 5). 
However, even as the consumer’s need for a horizontally  integrated provider has been 
reduced, providers can now integrate more products from different providers. The 
outcome in terms of horizontal disintegra tion depends on individual preferences, 
views on convenience, and cost s to search and assemble product sets. All of these are 
affected by changing access modes, eg from bran ch to internet, agent, or mobile app.

 Consumer interfaces are changing from ph ysical branches to convenient digital 
access from anywhere. Digital consumer in terfaces (eg web, mobile) enable new 
players to directly reach consumers both ne ar and far. By using apps from different 
competitors, consumers can build their own complete bank and gain more personalized services. This has likely reduc ed the value of legacy physical networks 
and the incumbent’s grip on the customer, who can easily  shift funds to different 
providers to access preferred services (Shev lin 2019). For example, the innovation of 
mobile money was a network- based account ledger provided by non-bank players 
and mobile network operators, leveragi ng already-ubiquitous mobile network 
connectivity infrastructure. This was co mbined with a new ecosystem of low-cost 
agents for the custome r interface, and a high degree of  automation to eliminate most 
back-office processes. Mobile money ecos ystems deliver low value/high volume 
transactions cost effectively, making this a viable offering for low income inclusive 
finance segments. Similarly, fintech payment aggregators ( eg Square and Stripe) offer 
convenient payment services to merchant s without the need for them to set up a 
merchant account with a processing bank. The aggregators act as the ‘merchant of record’ taking responsibility for compliance vis-à-vis network and bank requirements. 
A related development is th at the customer interface co uld be with institutions 
outside the jurisdictional boundaries of th e customer. On the internet, it does not 
matter to the consumer if the provider is in Kansas or Kathmandu (although it may matter to the regulator!) Servic es have adapted accordingly.  
Non-financial companies can also levera ge customer connectiv ity and data to 
offer financial services, altering the competitive landscape and blurring industry 
boundaries. As mobile applications and th e internet have become a dominant way 
through which consumers live their live s and businesses operate, e-commerce, 
telecom, online search, logistics/transpor tation, and social media platforms have 
become the new gatekeepers to the custome r. Digital platforms and big techs in 
particular are well placed to directly tap in to their vast customer  networks and data 
(BIS 2019). They are able to offer contextually  relevant financial services to their user 
bases to enhance the customer’s experience or increase sales of their core product. 
For example, e-commerce, ride-hailing, and social media platform s have integrated 
seamless payment services to strengthen the value proposition in their core markets. 
Micro-insurance has been embedded into mob ile money and the sale of consumer 
products. Users do not desire most financial services in and of themselves, but see 
them as a means to another activity (eg pa y a driver to reach a destination, take out 
a working capital loan to obtain inventory) . As such, embedding the financial service 
directly into that core activity can be attractive to the customer. It can even make the 
customer more aware of services about which they otherwise might not have known, or to which they might not have had access. Banks have used customer relationships 
to cross-sell financial services since the beginning of banking; now an increasing 
range of non-bank actors ar e doing the same thing.  
The back and middle office are bein g revamped – or eliminated entirely. 
Technology has reduced the costs of, and need for, much  of the traditional back-
office infrastructure, from pa per processing to data centres. The back office is being 
revamped to lower costs and improve communication. Process automation and 
upgrades to software and IT systems are causing a re structuring of financial 
institutions and a reduction of full-time employees. Middle-office functions such as 
reconciliations are increasingly unnecessary. Entire processes, and many of the skills 
that previously had to be hired, can be re placed with automation or expert systems. 
This has also given room for third parties to step in, such as cloud service providers  
 
16 BIS Papers No 117
 and fintechs with specialized capabilities th at sell their software-as-a-service (SaaS) 
to banks (eg data processing, credit scorin g, electronic know-your-customer (e-KYC)). 
For example, a bank can work with a credit-scoring company that leverages unique 
data and scoring expertise to prov ide a seamless customer experience.  
Unencumbered by legacy systems, some new entrants have built new software 
platforms to handle their core banking activities, while others rent. Cloud-based 
infrastructure and BaaS providers allow smaller banks to outsource technology 
operations and leverage the latest systems to compete alongside larger banks. They 
enable small start-ups to purchase not only  data processing and storage capacity, but 
also entry points into regulated infrastructure and regulatory compliance. Thus, smaller players can grow capacity in tan dem with their custom er base, without the 
initial setup costs and step function cost curves previously required.  
Technology has also accelerated the intern ationalization of back-office functions. 
For several decades there has been a trend of  offshoring back-office functions. Many 
financial firms first shifted call centre s and customer service to lower-cost 
environments; they later shif ted application processing an d IT operations. This trend 
is accelerated by the advent of cloud comp uting. Entire IT systems, including core 
banking systems, can now be hosted anywhere in the world. In regions with common 
regulatory frameworks, even th e entire provision of some products and services could 
be outside the boundaries of  the customer’s co untry. For example, a digital bank 
domiciled in Lithuania can bundle produc ts and services from elsewhere in the 
European Union (EU) and offer them to cu stomers over the enti re EU. On the other 
hand, in jurisdictions where the use of cl oud-based infrastructure and/or overseas 
data processing and storage ha ve been restricted (due to  data localization or other 
policies), efficiencies and entry may be limited. This is particularly true if the market is 
too small to support its own localized infrastr ucture. The shift of back-office functions 
– and associated processes and customer data – to other jurisdictions can raise a new 
set of supervisory challenges.  
Supporting infrastructures are changing. Much of the traditional infrastructure, 
which was both a cost and source of comp etitive advantage for incumbents, can be 
reduced or replaced, or must be shared. Digi tal identity (ID) and know your customer 
(KYC) registries are implemented in ma ny countries and ca n help redefine the 
onboarding and authentication process that  has long required in -person verification 
at a branch (D’Silva et al 2019). New infrastructures such as API platforms for 
payments or lending, and distributed ledger  systems that can support crypto-assets 
or stablecoins, could produce large networ k effects and change the role of, or even 
disintermediate, certain players (Arner et  al 2020). Open banking initiatives require 
banks to share customer data with fintechs. In some jurisdictions banks must initiate 
transactions introduced by fintechs upon  customer request, further eroding the 
traditional incumbent-customer relationship. At the same time, public payment 
system innovations have allowed access to non-banks. On the one hand, open banking APIs enable non-banks to offer pa yment initiation services, without them 
having to participate in any of the paym ent systems themselves . On the other hand 
central banks are requiring transparent an d risk-based access criteria for payment 
and settlement systems, replacing earlier restrictions of access to only banks.

 3. Implications for the industrial organization of the 
financial sector 
3.1 Implications for market entry 
Digital innovation has reduced cost barrie rs, allowing new and smaller players to 
enter. The elimination of many fixed costs and a reduction in variable and switching 
costs makes it possible for low-cost provi ders to enter the market, subject to local 
regulation. Although a trusted reputation must still be developed, small providers are 
more likely than in the past to be economic ally viable. Such new providers may strip 
away particular customer segm ents and revenue bases from traditional providers, or 
broaden access to finance fo r previously underserved segm ents, without needing to 
achieve large scale and scope. Apps an d cloud-based computing and software 
platforms have enabled entrepreneurs to qu ickly bootstrap withou t the need to raise 
huge amounts of capital to finance massive upfront investments. APIs and open 
banking initiatives have the potential to further accelerate this trend, since a new 
service need not wrench the cu stomer completely away fr om the incumbent, and can 
therefore build trust by layering a service on  top of the safety net provided by legacy 
institutions.  
Infrastructure connectivit y and a reduced need for ph ysical branches allow 
established companies from other sectors to  offer financial services as well. These 
entrants can deploy automated processes in  lieu of hiring a specialized workforce, 
connect to the financial transactions infrastructure, and leverage cloud-based 
infrastructures to reduce the cost of cross-market entry. For many of these new 
providers, such as digital platform comp anies and some telecoms, consumer trust 
and a customer base are already establish ed in their core markets and potentially 
transferable to the financial sector (Oliver  Wyman 2019). Some are able to combine 
financial services with other products or core capabilities as part of a platform 
offering. This is particularly relevant in  EMDEs where the financial system is less 
developed and access to financial services is  more limited. This affords fintechs and 
big techs more room to expand their financia l activities and compete with incumbents 
(FSB 2020). 
Entry into financial services is accele rated by the ability to turn regulatory 
compliance into a technology integration process. Several banks have built BaaS 
platforms to serve fintechs and even other banks. They can connect these clients to 
the payment system or a bank balance sheet, thus reducing the need to deal with the 
complexities of licensing, regulation, and developing their own co re banking systems. 
Leveraging BaaS, new entrants can tap into existing – and already regulated – financial 
transactions and balance sheet providers. Wh ere open banking is in force, they can 
also leverage the data, and sometimes functionality, of existing financial accounts. 
This allows a wider range of use cases into which finance can be embedded; in 
particular, a range of commercial platforms or transactional situations can layer on a financial service from a BaaS provider without much of the systems and compliance 
overhead previously required. While increasing competition, this multi-faceted and 
multi-tiered access to the r egulated banking sector intr oduces new challenges for 
regulators and supervisors,  as discussed below.   
 
18 BIS Papers No 117
 3.2 Shifting economies of scale and scope 
However, basic economic forces remain relevant. Economies of scale and scope 
remain, even as the minimum efficient sc ale for service delivery is lower for the 
individual user and for most financial services providers. That has been accomplished 
in part by shifting the scale effects to the infrastructure pr oviders; scale remains highly 
relevant in areas of cloud c omputing and data processing and software platforms. In 
fact, new forms of scale have emerged in connectivity and comp uting, along with 
previously present economies of scale in capital, including reputation, or ”trust 
capital.”  
In the digital finance era, economic fric tions have not disappeared, but take on 
new forms. The costs of services have been  reduced in many cases, but certainly not 
eliminated. Financial services providers, part icularly new non-bank providers, face two 
important costs in the unbundled marketplace: 
• Customer acquisition costs.  Customer acquisition costs, comprising marketing, 
onboarding, KYC, and initial credit assessment, remain significant relative to 
revenues, especially for retail financial serv ices. This is partly due to regulatory 
requirements, but marketing and other onboarding costs remain pertinent even 
when remote interactions are possible ( eg leveraging e-KYC). While technology 
has made it easy to directly reach us ers digitally, the cost to acquire new 
customers remains high because of user inertia, which is particularly present in retail and SME business lines. Customer acquisition costs are also significant for 
wholesale customers, as sy stems integration and busi ness process changes may 
be cumbersome, and initial credit assessment is more complex. Amortizing these and other fixed costs across more custom ers and products allows for economies 
of scale and scope. This naturally puts larger incumbents an d big techs at an 
advantage.  
• Funding costs.  As noted above, some products have natural complementarities 
that reduce the cost of pr oviding one or the other prod uct if offered in tandem. 
Most clearly, offering loans is more economical if there is a cheap source of 
funding in the form of deposits. There are other complementarities in derivatives, stock lending, insurance, etc. Size, and th e diversification it brings, can provide a 
funding advantage due to lower risk, an d greater liquidity of traded funding 
instruments (bonds, shares) issued at scal e. In general, big tech firms have a 
higher overall cost of fu nding than global systemically important financial 
institutions (G-SIFIs) because they use more equity and have no deposits. 
However, when analysing similar funding components (ie bonds) big techs tend 
to have a lower cost at issuance (Graph 6). 
   
 
BIS Papers No 117 19
 Consumers and other users also experience frictions in the unbundled financial 
services marketplace. As consumers balance choice and convenienc e, they may favour 
firms offering broader scope: 
• Assembly costs.  Simplicity and convenience have significant value, often resulting 
in preferences for a single provider that  offers an integrated suite of financial 
products and services, even if each indi vidual product may be less convenient or 
well-designed, or marginally more expens ive, than those of alternative niche 
providers. For many consumer s, there is a cost to the time, effort, and potential 
confusion of assembling fragmented se rvices from unbundled providers and 
moving funds between them. Thus, most savers still use intermediaries or platforms to deploy their savings instead of searching out in dividual borrowers. 
Similarly, “contextualized finance” embeds  the financial service into the actual 
economic activity the custom er is seeking to perform (eg pay for a trip on a hail 
riding platform, take out a loan on an e-commerce platform). This can provide 
the service that is needed exactly when it is needed. Wher e the customer is 
already using a platform provider or big tech, onboarding costs are reduced, and 
convenience for the user creates economie s of scope for the provider. The rise 
of “super apps” such as WeChat, AliPay , Yandex, and Grab, and contenders such 
as Rappi and Revolut which add multiple services, is testament to the value consumers place on being able to go to a single source for multiple services.  
• Switching costs.  For consumers, business users and financial services providers 
considering a change of vendor , there are barriers in the form of effort, inertia, 
inconvenience, and the difficulty of disentangling a service that has been linked Average spread of active bonds to be nchmark government bonds at issuance

 to multiple activities and systems. Switch ing costs can also result from intentional 
technical design. Consumers may flock to digital platforms wi th large customer 
bases to benefit from network effects. Ye t once they become large, platforms 
may seek to increase switching costs. If a service has been integrated into 
multiple activities or workflows, or has accumulated significan t user data, it may 
also able to provide better or more tailo red services that a new provider would 
not be able to match. Where proprietary protocols are in place, or historical data are difficult to share, conne ctivity across different prov iders might be hindered.  
3.3 Impact on financial services providers 
Reduced economic frictions, the ability to reconfigure the value chain, new 
opportunities for entry, and shifting economies of scale and scope will affect different financial services providers differently. The impact will depend on their current market 
positions and ability to leverage technology . Incumbents start with advantages in 
trust capital and regulatory position. Fintec hs are proving nimble at leveraging data, 
connectivity, and improved processing capaci ty, and at converting regulatory barriers 
into solvable technology challenges. Big te chs compound the adva ntages of fintechs 
with large scale existing customer bases for non-financial business lines, associated customer data, and high levels of brand trust (Stulz 2020; OECD 2020).
8 Individuals 
play a limited role as financial service providers today, interacting largely via 
intermediaries. In a future of increased connectivity and decentralized finance, 
individuals may be further empowered as di rect providers of financial services.  
Incumbents 
Although there is increasing competition,  the continued relevance of basic economic 
forces enables incumbent financial institutions with integrated product offerings to maintain – at least for now – significant ma rket share. Incumbents  have an advantage 
in having already overcome some of the information asymmetries that form a barrier 
to trust: they are regulated and have b een in the market an d demonstrated their 
reliability over time. Multi-product incumb ents ameliorate cust omer switching and 
assembly costs. Incumbents benefit from ec onomies of scale in financial capital, and 
the diversification benefits inherent in la rger scale and broader scope. Incumbents 
also have economies of scal e in customer data, which they are beginning to better 
leverage, and customers often have higher tr ust in incumbents to safeguard their data 
(Armantier et al 2021).  
Unbundling could reduce the cross-subsidies that are i nherent in the integrated 
banking model. Free use of a current acco unt is often funded by the use of the 
balances to lend to other customers, or by the value created in providing other 
products to the account holder. While pr oduct tying is often considered an anti-
competitive practice, in most markets traditional banking products have explicit 
exemption from anti-tying rules (see, eg OCC 1995). Disaggregation can disrupt this 
business model, potentially stripping away th e more profitable products and services 
that have stand-alone profitability (eg remittances), and leaving traditional providers 
 
8  Surveys of the most trusted consumer brands globally and in the US continue to place big techs well 
above financial institutions. See Morning Consult (2021). On the other hand, Arma ntier et al. (2021) 
find that US consumers trust big techs the least to safeguard their personal data, and have more trust 
in banks, followed by fintechs and the government . The difference may be explained in part by the 
difference in overall brand trust versus trust to safeguard personal data.   
 
BIS Papers No 117 21
 with an embedded cost base and products with low margins or  that the market 
expects to get for free. Open banking regu lations that require banks to offer access 
to their customers’ accounts coul d accelerate this process.  
Incumbents are innovating and upgradin g across each component of the value 
chain. Indeed, a recent World Bank survey finds that digital transformation is a 
strategic priority for the overwhelming ma jority of incumbents. They aim to shed 
overhead costs and employees, improve pr oducts, and compete for the consumer 
relationship (Feyen et al 2021). Many expect further growth in digital customer 
interactions and transactions, which will inte nsify competition. The largest institutions 
can leverage their scale, customer base, regu latory expertise, and capacity to update 
their technology stacks and manage large balance sheets in order to effectively 
compete with big tech entrants. Smaller institutions can take advantage of on-
demand infrastructure and exte rnal service providers to undertake a rapid and less 
costly digital transformation. Incumbents that  are not able to adapt in time may perish 
or be acquired. 
Some incumbents have built distribution  platforms to enrich their own product 
offering by allowing fintechs to offer their products directly to the incumbent’s users. 
In essence, these incumbents have be come marketplaces and leverage network 
effects.9 Innovations in infrastructure such as  APIs can facilitate these partnerships, 
which benefit from both the fintechs’ need to achieve scale, and banks’ continued 
centrality in the financial services relati onship for many customers. As long as 
customers remain tethered to bank accounts directly or through fintechs, banks can continue to benefit from their own economies  of scale in capital, connectivity, and 
high-fidelity consumer financial data.  
Banks continue to have deep expertise in regulation and compliance and have 
already passed key regulatory hurdles ahead of new entrants. Many  fintechs and big 
techs offer their financial services in close direct or indirect collaboration with banks 
to access the regulated financia l system at the back  office or infrastructure layers. B2B 
fintechs and big techs offer th eir services to incumbents in the form of partnerships 
or SaaS engagements. This is  also the main level where banks engage with big techs 
to procure state-of-the-art cloud comput ing and data processing services which 
require deep expertise and economies of sc ale. Business-to-consumer (B2C) fintechs 
and big techs that compete directly at the customer interface level often still rely on 
banks themselves to store va lue (eg the so-called float, or deposited funds, of mobile 
money operators). They also use banks to access the payment system, or use other 
core banking system functions that are difficult to build in-house (eg by using BaaS). 
Moreover, depending on the regulatory en vironment and the business model choices 
fintechs make, their customers often need to have an accoun t with a financial 
institution to use the fintechs’ services, driving continued deman d for at least some 
incumbents’ services. 
Incumbents also have a comparative ad vantage in managing complex, large 
balance sheets and navigating compliance with evolving regulations. This is critical 
since finance is one of the mos t highly regulated sectors. As such, many fintechs and 
big techs may be reluctant to become full-fledged regulat ed financial institutions, 
which can be a slow, costly, and uncertain process. However, regtech solutions could 
erode part of this comparative advanta ge of incumbents (Auer 2019). As another

22 BIS Papers No 117
 example, lending platforms al so rely on incumbents and institutional investors to 
purchase the loans originated on the platform.  
The main challenge for incumbents is that they are encu mbered by legacy 
systems, networks, and cultures; not all w ill be able to adapt and survive. Legacy, 
fixed-cost infrastructure cannot be easily scaled back at the same rate as it becomes 
obsolete. Financial institutions (and regu lators) are also mindful of the need to 
maintain minimum services for non-digitiz ed customer segments, especially in more 
remote locations where altern atives are limited. Incumben ts bear regulatory and 
compliance requirements that  may not apply to new competitors or that can be 
evaded via regulatory arbitrage. Incumbents  may also have service obligations not 
imposed on fintech or big tech players. Th ese regulatory and social obligations can 
present competitive disadvanta ges if steps are not taken to level the playing field.  
Fintechs 
After driving the unbundling of financial se rvices, many fintechs have begun to re-
bundle. Fintechs have been adding new products to their offerings, by themselves or 
via partnerships and platform approaches. Th is allows them to cr oss-sell to existing 
customers and make themselves more attr active to new ones. Some examples are 
shown in Graph 7. For some, this has been the result of opportunities to provide a 
better customer experience and increase reve nue. For others, it has been a matter of 
necessity. Since scale and scope economies still matter, fintechs that focused on a 
limited range of products may not be able to achieve funding synergies or amortize 
customer acquisition costs, regulatory compliance costs, and investments in brand 
recognition across a sufficiently large revenue base to be able to generate profits or 
fully compete on price with incumbents. It will be interesting to observe how these 
newly re-bundled product sets evolve. Newer companies building up a set of services 
for a particular customer base in today’s environment, leveraging high quality-data 
on market needs and customer profitability, will doubtless arrive at a different product 
set than was developed by uni versal banks through agglomeration of products over 
a long period, from the 18th to the 20th centuries.  
New entrants initially stayed away from financial activities that carry large 
licensing, capital and regulatory burdens. Mo st new players focused on activities such 
as payments, cards and financial advice , and avoided highly regulated, capital 
intensive activities such as on-balance sheet lending and secu rities underwriting. 
Indeed, the rapid rise of fintechs was facilit ated in many markets by regulatory gaps 
that allowed new service providers to en ter and operate with minimal regulatory 
burden. As regulators caught up, fintech stra tegies shifted; in so me markets they were 
forced to seek licenses.  
Some fintechs have chosen a regulated status as part of their evolving product 
strategies. For example, alte rnative finance platforms initially focused on matching 
supply and demand of capital, avoiding th e regulatory burden of intermediation. 
However, in the process of re-bundling, some fintechs have sought full banking 
licenses. In particular, lending platforms have faced challenges to fund their operations in wholesale markets or using a pure P2P funding model. As a result, they 
have become more reliant on incumbents for funding, or have sought their own 
banking licenses. For example, Grab and SoFi have sought banking licenses, while GoJek and MoneyTap partner with banks (the latter also has a non-bank financial 
company license). Other fintechs prefer to  avoid a higher regulatory burden by 
expanding across borders to reach scale wi th their existing product offering. The  
 
BIS Papers No 117 23
 COVID-19 pandemic and resu lting economic dislocatio ns have exacerbated the 
challenges of relying on crow dfunding, capital markets, or bank partners for balance 
sheet capacity. As a result, two prominent early fintech le nders, OnDeck and Kabbage, 
were sold to other companies in July and August 2020.  
Big techs 
Basic economic forces such as  scale and scope economies, along with network effects, 
also play to the fundamental strengths of big tech companies. Big techs already enjoy 
an active customer base, cr eating economies of scale an d scope and network effects 
in their core markets; they are increasing ly able to leverage these to exert market 
power in the financial sector (BIS 2 019; Frost et al 2019). Agility in systems 
development and creating easy-to-use custom er interfaces are relative strengths of 
tech companies compared to traditional fina ncial institutions, and big techs’ access 
to customer data and understanding of customer behaviours may equal or exceed 
those of financial institutions. Big techs can bundle financial services to reinforce the value proposition of the ecosystem in thei r core markets, such as e-commerce and 
social media, or offer financial services as a new product line cross-sold to the existing 
customer base. This phenom enon is manifest in devel oped and emerging markets, 
often led by the latter. Alibaba was a leader  in layering payments onto e-commerce 
with AliPay. It then developed a broad range of financial services. (By contrast, eBay’s 
integration of the original incarnation of Pa yPal did not go as fa r). Marketplaces from 
Amazon to Gojek, Grab, Jumia, Lazada, an d Mercado Libre are integrating merchant 
loans into their offerings. Because financ ial services are layered over other cash 
generating activities, these companies can subsidize the financial services. For 
instance, WeChat Pay, WhatsApp Pay and other providers allow users to send money 
to each other for free – though fees may be  higher for merchants and business users. 
In some cases, the value a big tech can gene rate from customer data by driving traffic 
to its core business may be higher th an the financial service fee income.  Fintech product offerings have expanded over time Graph 7
 
 
24 BIS Papers No 117
 Big techs have already amass ed vast troves of relevant alternative customer data 
which traditional financial institutions lack. Combined with their ability to process 
these data for insights, this has enabled bi g techs to offer tailored financial services 
such as insurance or work ing capital loans to merchants on their platforms who 
traditionally lack collateral or strong credit  histories. This has uprooted the notion of 
traditional “relationship banking” in which banks have superior proprietary hard and 
soft information about their clients thus keeping them captive. Big techs also often choose to partner with incumbent financial in stitutions to offer these services so they 
can focus on their core markets. Regardless,  bundling of services sets in motion a 
feedback loop, ie the data-net work-activities (DNA) loop (see Box B) where big tech 
ecosystems become more valuable to user s. This begets new users, higher user 
engagement, and more user data. This in turn boosts network effects and economies 
of scale and scope, which enable big techs to increase the value of their ecosystems. 
Big techs can leverage unique market powe r in providing contextual finance – 
the bundling of financial services with core activities. In addition  to the data-network-
activity feedback loop described above, “contextualized financ e” may result in 
improved operational efficien cy and portfolio performance relative to traditional 
financial institutions. A ride hailing service th at is financing the driver’s automobile 
can monitor usage, maintenance patterns, and cash flows. A distribution platform offering working capital credi t to retailers purchasing inventory could cut off the 
supply of goods if the retailer is late in repaying; similarly, an e-commerce platform 
providing logistics and financing to merchants could seize inventory. Given network effects and high switching costs, big tech s could enforce loan repayments by the 
simple threat of a downgrade or exclusio n from their ecosystem in case of default. 
Their position as customer gatekeepers in their core businesses helps establish roles 
as gatekeepers and potentially enforcers fo r financial services, as well. Although 
research has shown that fint ech and big tech credit tends to complement, rather than 
replace, other forms of credit (see Box B), some big techs have explored becoming a 
full-fledged deposit-taking financ ial institution. Big techs ac tive in EMDEs, with lower 
levels of financial development and inclusion and more permissive regulatory 
environments, have had more scope to vent ure on this path. Other jurisdictions 
impose limits to the span of activities of regulated financial institutions, with the result that big techs have not taken on a regulatory status that might restrict their ability to continue their other activities.

Individuals as financial services providers 
Technology will enable individuals to move beyond providing finance via 
intermediaries. Today, individual savers pr ovide the deposits that banks use to lend, 
and equity capital via investment and pensio n funds. There is the occasional direct Box B 
The data-network-activity feedback loop ma y explain the rapid growth of big tech 
credit 
The data-network-activity (DNA) feedback loop helps big te ch firms to correctly predict clients’ creditworthiness, 
future income and individual demands (BIS 2019). As a resu lt, big techs can have a competitive advantage over banks 
and serve firms and households that othe rwise would remain unbanked. Recent wo rk suggests that big techs’ credit 
scoring applied to small vendors outperforms models ba sed on credit bureau ratings and traditional borrower 
characteristics (Frost et al 2019; Gamb acorta et al 2019). All this could repres ent a significant advance in financial 
inclusion and help improve firms’ pe rformance (see Luohan Academy, 2018). 
Cornelli et al (2020a) find that in 2019, fintech and big te ch credit (together “total alternative credit”) reached 
nearly USD 800 bn globally (see Figure B1 ). Big tech credit has shown particularly  rapid growth in Asia (China, Japan, 
Korea and Southeast Asia), and some count ries in Africa and Latin America. By contrast, fintech credit volumes have 
declined in 2018-19 due to market and regu latory developments in Ch ina. Outside China, fintec h credit is still growing. 
These alternative forms of credit are more developed in c ountries with higher GDP per capita (at a declining rate), 
where banking sector mark-ups are higher and where banking re gulation is less stringent. Fintech credit is also more 
developed where there are fewer bank branches per capita . Moreover, these alternative forms of credit are more 
developed where the ease of doing business is higher, invest or protection disclosure and the efficiency of the judicial 
system are higher, the bank credit to deposit ratio is lowe r, and where bond and equity markets are more developed. 
Overall, both fintech and big tech credit seems to compleme nt other forms of credit, not to substitute for them, and 
may increase overall credit access.

 family loan, or high net worth angel invest or providing direct finance. Technology 
could allow this to be much mo re pervasive. P2P was an initial step in that direction. 
Reduction of the frictions that give rise to intermediation raises the prospect of 
radical disintermediation such  that individuals become financial services providers 
directly. The core of financial services is the transfer of resour ces between individuals 
directly and over time. New technologies  could decentralize decision-making, risk-
taking and record keeping (FSB 2019a). Di stributed ledger techno logies (DLT) have 
already demonstrated the potential for transf ers of value without intermediaries. P2P 
lending was designed as a way to directly transfer resources and risk, with limited 
centralized matching services by the P2P platform. Technology obviates the need for 
a bank balance sheet by synthesizing a set of contributing liabilities against each asset 
(loan) as it is originated. Even these platforms could be eliminated. Dras tic reductions 
in search costs could allow individuals at the retail level to connect directly to borrowers. Publicly available data and an alytics applications could be applied to 
investments decisions and portfolio construction at the individual level, as 
robo-advisors are already doing. Smart co ntracts could automate monitoring and 
collection processes and reduce  the coordination costs for a borrower working with 
multiple small lenders.  
To date, consumers have not broadly embraced the ro l e  o f  d i r e c t  p a y m e n t s  
provider in decentralized models. DL T-based alternative payments via 
cryptocurrencies are growing but the ma in use of cryptocurrencies has been 
speculation rather than payments. Most in dividuals using crypto-currency still prefer 
to go through crypto-currency wallet pr oviders or exchanges . While decentralized 
finance (“DeFi”) and decentralized apps (“DApps”) are growing, these are still a niche 
market (Schär 2021). Other venues that mi ght have fostered direct peer-to-peer 
exchange such as soci al media platforms and messaging  apps have either offered 
payments intermediation themse lves or linked to banks.  
Similarly, individuals have been reluctan t to act as direct lenders assuming full 
responsibility for credit screening and lending decisions. P2P marketplaces initially offered savers the ability to choose individual borrowers. The option for micro-
assembly of loan portfolios is not much used, however; most consumers chose to let 
the platforms algorithmically allocate thei r funds. Behaviour on equity crowdfunding 
platforms is somewhat different , though increasingly these platforms are also offering 
diversified fund structures to consumers who would prefer not to individually vet 
investments. OurCrowd, for example, began with a direct indivi dual selection model 
but now operates a full menu of funds to allow investors to programmatically deploy and diversify.  
The direction of technology and deve lopments in decentralized finance, 
however, suggests that thes e trends bear monitoring. Wh ile savings and investment 
activities still bear a high cost of assembly , part of the promise of technology is the 
empowerment of individuals. Technology is  reducing the need for intermediaries. Un-
intermediated finance would render any in dividual with surplus funds a financial 
services provider. While the emergence of in dividuals as direct providers of financial 
services is nascent at presen t, it cannot be discounted as a potential influence on 
market structure in the future.

 3.4 Impact on sector compositi on, competition, concentration 
The diversity of the financial sector has increased in both dev eloped and emerging 
markets. Alongside incumbents, there are ma ny different types and sizes of fintechs 
and big techs, offering a wide range of financial services. Some remain focused on a 
single product or service, while others  have leveraged their initial successes to 
broaden their service offerings (eg Square  a n d  P a y P a l  m o v i n g  f r o m  p a y m e n t s  t o  
lending). Some fintechs are converting to banks, while others have become service 
providers to, or value chain partners with banks. Depending on licensing approaches 
in different jurisdictions, a range of digita l-only or digital-mainly neo-banks emerged. 
They compete largely in the same regu latory space as incumbents, but with 
modernized business models and streamlined infrastructure. Big techs with core 
markets ranging from telecommunications to logistics, transportation, e-commerce 
marketplaces, and online search  add another set of diverse players to the industry. 
Incumbents are also adopting new technology, partnering with fintechs, setting up new digital units and otherwise adapting  to the new environment. This hyper-
diversification of financial services has im plications for competition, as well as for 
regulation (see section 4). 
Fintechs have significantly increased competitive pressu re by directly engaging 
with the consumer. The battle to ‘own the customer’ will be closely fought, since in 
most industries the links in the value chai n closest to the cust omer earn the highest 
margins (eg European Banking Authority ( 2018), OECD (2020), Petralia (2020)). Some 
fintechs have skilfully targeted high-margi n products or services and stripped those 
away from incumbents, leaving the incumbents with a lower-margin product mix. For example, companies like Wise (previously Transferwise) and Remitly targeted the 
relatively high-margin international transfer business. However, many fintechs are 
struggling to compete at scale. Through re -bundling, some digital-only banks may 
be able to broaden scope and compete at scale, but at the cost of having to maintain 
a broader product mix in which some products or customers will generate lower margins. 
Disruption may be contained in areas where fintechs them selves relying on 
incumbents for their operations. As described above, many fintechs still rely on banks 
to store value and process payments, and users often originate fintech transactions 
from an account with a financial institution. Products like Wise rely on existing bank or card accounts not only for the cash-in/cash-out (CI/CO) functions, but also for a 
layer of KYC compliance. In some markets, digital financial services providers have 
built their own infrastructure for some of these functions (eg mobile agent networks 
for CI/CO). The introduction of stableco ins and CBDCs might r educe the dependence 
of fintechs on incumbents, particularly for payment services.  
For fintechs that target back-office acti vities, the relationship with incumbents 
will be collaborative. For example, B2B fintec hs offer services to incumbents in the 
form of partnerships or SaaS engageme nts. BaaS providers present a distinct 
competitive challenge.  These regulated banks enable a range of businesses, including 
fintechs, to compete more effectively with other  banks. The ability to embed a tailored 
payment, loan, insurance or other financia l service into any economic, business, or 
social activity may be the most powerful di sruptor of traditional financial services, and 
this is an area in which big techs excel.  
Big techs have the potential to compete at scale and become dominant players. 
They already enjoy economies of scale and scope and network effe cts in their core  
 
28 BIS Papers No 117
 markets. By adding financial services to their ecosystems, on their own or using BaaS, 
they can leverage these ec onomies to compete with traditional providers and 
fintechs. They also have the clout and deep  pockets to navigate  complex regulations 
and build parallel infrastructures and closed-loop systems, which could solidify their role as gatekeepers to the consumer (and th eir relevant data) in the financial sector. 
The resulting “winner-takes-all” or “w inner-takes-most” dynamics may reduce 
competition and contestability of the sect or and trigger monopolistic behaviour as 
customers become locked-in. Some big tech s (eg AliPay) fortify customer lock-in by 
allowing funds to flow into their systems for free but charging a fee for withdrawals. 
They may tie the availability of a loan to consumption of other platform services, or 
cross-subsidize financial services with reve nues from their core business. This could 
result in consumer benefits but destructive competition for the rest of the sector and 
potentially in other sectors. While there ar e ways regulators can attempt to re-level 
the playing field,
10 the intermingling of financial and non-financial services presents 
a number of challenging financial regulation and competition policy issues (see 
below). 
Incumbents large and small are embrac ing digital transformation across the 
value chain to compete with  fintechs and big techs. Competitive pressure on 
traditional financial institutions may force even those that are lagging to transform or risk erosion of their customer  base, income, and margins. In addition to partnering 
with fintechs, some have set up their ow n digital-only banks. Where regulation 
permits, as in Thailand, some banks have countered the big tech incursion into banking with bank-centric e-commerce market place offerings (for example, Kasikorn 
Bank’s K+ market). Formerly captive loca l markets have become highly contestable 
by international players (eg DBS entry to India via Digibank). Local banks or those 
serving specific industries may still be competitive in their niche markets, if they can manage the transition to digital delivery an d maintain customer trust and loyalty, and 
the other competitors don’t turn their focus to those niches.  
The largest markets might be expect ed to receive more attention from 
innovators, but small markets are affected as well. Overall, fintech adoption seems to 
be higher in higher-income markets (Didier et al 2021), and these will often be more 
attractive for Venture Capital investment. However, some mid-size countries have 
been ahead of the digital finance curve, perhaps because they had not received 
sufficient investment in traditional financial services and there were more 
underserved segments or larger margins to  capture. Kenya’s ecosystem of digital 
payments, savings, and lending is a prominen t example. Innovators in small countries 
can leverage the cost reductions discussed above to enter markets that may not have 
been viable with a higher co st structure. For some services, however, small markets 
may lag in terms of home-grown innovation. Innovations centred on data use may 
advance faster in larger markets that generate more data (World Bank 2021). 
Emerging and smaller markets could nonetheless benefit from incumbent 
transformation or geographic extension.  The local incumbents can adopt new 
technologies to improve reach and effici ency, and large regi onal telecom and e-
commerce players could extend financial services into these smaller markets. The

permitting banks to operate e-comme rce marketplaces and offer certain IT services to their clients.

BIS Papers No 117 29
 ability to serve remotely could make a small market part of a larger market, provided 
the regulatory frameworks permit.  
More intense competition among a more diverse set of industry participants 
could result in a range of possible mark et outcomes. As diff erent institutions 
compete, cooperate or do bo th, industry structure will evolve, depending on which 
combination of three forces prevail in a given market. 
1. Economies of scale and scope:  where production costs remain significant relative 
to revenues (or cross-subsidization is possible), and network effects and 
switching costs or convenience effects are significant, we may expect 
consolidation into a set of large players who can leverage scale in capital, connectivity, and data to offer a broad ra nge of products at high volume and low 
cost. This could potentially also result in displacement of incumbent financial 
institutions by big tech firms, in particular in the retail banking domain. The conditions for “natural monopolies” coul d result from strong scale economies 
combined with low marginal costs of service provision. These are countered by 
the reduction in fixed costs that allow for smaller scale entry.  
2. Preferences for choice or convenience:  As we have seen, alongside the economies 
of scale achievable by big players, technology has enabled unbundling of 
products and services. These may vary  along price, quality, and service 
dimensions. Customer can choose a custom mix of separate products and self-
aggregate. This is more likely when cust omers are extremely price-sensitive or 
value more tailored servic es, and search an d switching costs are low. Niche 
providers can then focus on  product-market fit for a target customer base, and 
t h a t  c u s t o m e r  b a s e  c a n  e a s i l y  f i n d  t h e product and migrate to it. The niche 
providers can thrive, taking advantage of their ability to manage infrastructure costs while reaching and retaining their target customers wherever they may be. 
The unbundling effects coul d dominate, with a result ing atomization of the 
industry. In this scenario , there would be space for new players that enable 
aggregation of the services and those that provide commo n services to the entire 
market. On the other hand, too much choice can overwhelm individuals and 
undermine the benefits that choice ca n provide (Schwartz, 2005). Search and 
switching costs may reduce the convenience of self-aggregation. Customers may 
then prefer banks or platforms that integr ate services for them, even if they end 
up paying more or accepting inferi or service for one or more products. 
3. Regulation:  The above two forces will not play out independently from the 
actions of financial services and competition regulators, who will continue to shape outcomes with a vari ety of policy instruments. 
Given the diversity of providers and cons umers, the corner solutions of large 
multi-product players and small focused play ers may co-exist. As shown in Graph 8, 
the tendency of providers to seek scale (leverage scale, scope, and network 
economies) alongside consumer  preferences for choice coul d result in four potential 
configurations, of which two appear to be dominant outcomes. A small player (left 
bottom corner) attempting to provide a broad range of products will find it difficult 
to deliver fully across that product range, and will be pressured to either merge with others to grow large (left upper corner) or  to focus on niche services (right lower 
corner). A large company with an initially narrow scope (right upper corner) will find 
that its size enables it to broaden, and will tend to add products (left upper corner). 
For instance, a payments firm may choose to add lending or insurance services, while an international money services provider may start offering checking accounts.  
 
30 BIS Papers No 117
 Thus the financial services market may coalesce around one set of providers 
adopting large/multi-product strategies, and another set offering focused products 
and services. This might be termed a “barbell” distribution, with a small set of large 
multi-product players on one side, and a large set of small niche service players on 
the other.11 While this market structure reflects  in part the “winner-takes-all” or 
“winner-takes-most” character of some tech -driven markets, the impact of friction 
and cost-reducing innovation in finance leaves the door open for smaller players to 
thrive. If regulation permits, this may mean continued market fluidity from new 
entrants and cross-overs from one sub-sector to another. 
The large, multi-product players could in clude traditional players, fintechs and 
big techs – ie both incumbents and new en trants (Graph 9). Th ese may include banks 
that master the digital transf ormation, along with new financial services entrants that 
achieve scale, and big techs or other firm s that have customer data and can link to 
BaaS. A recent survey indica ted that large banks are ahead of smaller banks in terms 
of digital transformation, and are overall more positive about the impact of 
technology on their businesses (Feyen et al 2021). Banks that pull ahead in terms of 
digitization will be able to leverage the DNA feedback loop to grow market share 
relative to other banks. Some technology-s avvy and agile smaller or newer banks and 
bank-like players could also  ride this wave to grow.12 Big techs, on the other hand, 
enter the large size of the barbell on the strength of the customer base they bring 
 
11  So-called ‘barbell’ distributions, with clusters on two ends of the scale, have been observed in many 
markets, including labour markets (Autor 2019), product pricing and qua lity (Britton, 2018), and 
portfolio strategy (Rutherford 2013). Such distributions have been observed in banking markets in previous periods or disr uption, for example in the wake of mega-mergers in the US in the 1990s 
(Deogun 1996) and the financial crisis of 2008. 
12  For example, NuBank (a payment services provider ) in Brazil went rapidly from challenger to 30 
million customers, placing it in the top ranks in that  market. Cross-River Bank in the US has just one 
branch, but leveraged fintech to be one of the bi ggest lenders nationwide for the US Government’s 
pandemic response program (Cowley 2020). Corner solutions of scale vs. atomization Graph 8

Source: authors’ elaborations.  
The small, niche players could also incl ude some traditional providers alongside 
fintechs (Graph 9). Niche players may direct ly serve customers with a focused product 
set, or may serve large players with B2B se rvices. Small local institutions such as 
community banks and credit cooperative banks, for example, occupy geographic 
niches and fill gaps not served by larger in stitutions, and may have significant trust 
capital as a competitive advantage (Mester 2018). A recent study of regional banks in 
the US found that many have been able to  leverage technology and geographic focus 
to thrive against large scale players (Ale xopoulos 2020). Many fintechs enter the 
market as single product providers or with a product tailored to a specific market segment, such as small businesses in a give n industry or set of markets. Unbundled 
fintech service providers with a strong va lue proposition can viably serve a narrow 
market given the ability to reduce fi xed costs using flexible cloud-based 
infrastructure, digital channels, and othe r service delivery innovations, and build 
customer affinity with tailored products. De-centralization through DLT and other 
innovations will enable service providers to build on these new products and infrastructures to provide additional unb undled services. Small niche players could 
thus continue to thrive as they tailor their products and services to a specific market 
segment or customer base. As noted abov e, there are scenario s where individuals 
could act as direct providers of certain pr oducts or services; these would be extreme 
instances of small niche players. 
There is likely to be a degree of connectivi ty between the two en ds of the barbell. 
Some narrow, tailored services will partner with large institutions to provide their 
specialized services to the customers of the larger institutions, while big techs and 
other platforms may provide some of the co nnectivity that allows small fintechs to 
reach customers. The size of both ends  of the barbell are also influenced by 
regulations that might limit the size of a particular firm.

 A barbell is a potential steady state market  structure, as some participants grow 
larger but innovation drives continued entr y. During the current transition phase, 
small multi-product providers and mid-size pl ayers continue to operate, increasingly 
challenged to compete against the scale pl ayers or to lock in a focused niche. 
Re-bundling by the larger fo rmerly single-product fintechs is well underway in the 
more advanced markets, and entry by big tech s is adding to the large player end of 
the distribution directly. Entry can continua lly replenish the small player end of the 
distribution. Large players will inevitably leave some markets less well-served and new 
technologies will continue to reduce costs or offer the prospect of new products. As 
long as regulatory barriers are not rais ed, entrepreneurs will continue to bring 
innovative new products and services to  the market; these may not compete across 
the board with the large players but pr ovide a reservoir of contestability to 
counterbalance the concentrated end of the barbell. As illustrated in Graph 8, there will be a tendency for players to either fo cus or to move to the large/multi-product 
space. Left to market forces , the dominance of the two si des of the barbell may very 
well squeeze out the middle (except insofar as a company passes through on its growth path from one side to the other). Those providers that cannot achieve the 
scale to compete with the larger provider s but fail to focus on a sustainable niche 
may be forced to exit. A recent survey by FIS on new banking relationships established in the US in the last 12 months showed that 37% of new banking relationships went 
to large banks and 48% went to niche and neo banks (community banks, credit 
unions, online banks and non-bank entities);  the in-between regi onal banks got only 
10% (see Marous 2021). 
A barbell is not the only possible outcome, but is a central case given the 
economic forces at work. Co ntinued atomization, stalled re-aggregation, or limits on 
entry could result in a different configuration. Factors that will contribute to determining this outcome incl ude core market forces such  as the economies of scale 
and scope discussed above, r egulatory limits on entry or on re-aggregation by non-
banks, and consumer preferences for trus ted incumbents or for convenience and 
internal product linkage vs. tailored solutions and more direct control. Societal 
preferences will matter and will be express ed not only by consumers but also in the 
degree to which policies for, and regulation of, financial services, competition, and 
consumer protection shape both mark et forces and consumer behaviour. 
4. Policy implications and new trade-offs 
National authorities aim to foster the benefits of digital transformation in finance. 
These include reduced costs and frictions, increased e fficiency and competition, 
narrowing information asymmetry, and broadened access to financial services. At the same time, authorities are aware of the pote ntial risks to the financial system and to 
customers (FSB 2017). A policy agenda (“Ba li Fintech Agenda”) ou tlined by the World 
Bank and IMF advocates embracing the promi se of fintech while managing risks to 
consumers and to the stability and integrity of the financial system (World Bank/IMF 
2018). In particular, reinforcing competition  and a commitment to open, free, and 
contestable markets were seen as a foundat ion for innovation and consumer choice 
while maintaining a level playing field. The Agenda also re cognized the need to adapt 
regulatory frameworks and supervisory practices , including monitoring of new market 
participants, to facilitate the safe entry of  new products, activities, and intermediaries 
while maintaining financial stability and sustaining trust, confidence, and the ability  
 
BIS Papers No 117 33
 to respond to risks. The importance of robust data infrastructure, both from a 
cybersecurity perspective and with respect to concentration risks, data ownership, 
protection, and privacy, was also noted. 
Reinforcing competition requires taking bo th horizontal and vertical views of the 
financial services landscape, and cooper ation between financial and competition 
authorities. Horizontally, how a market is  defined is fundamental to the assessment 
of competition. The multiplicity of financial products, the tendency to bundle them, and the role of multi-sided ma rket dynamics in providing and pricing all make this a 
more complex landscape. Vertically, a compet itive market at the consumer level may 
mask concentration at different levels of the reconfigured financial services value chains. With finance increasingly embedded as an adjunct in ot her businesses, it 
becomes critical for financial regulators  to coordinate with  other regulators, 
particularly where the adjacent businesses  are themselves highly concentrated or 
subject to network effects. Co nsideration of ex ante vs ex  post remedies may need to 
recognize the particular featur es of data concentration, th e power to exclude, and the 
gateway functions inherent in em erging digital business models.  
Adapting regulatory frameworks will require recognizing new and sometimes 
heightened trade-offs between specific polic y goals. Changes in provider diversity 
and the competitive landscap e may imply a need to revisit the regulatory perimeter 
and supervisory practices. Meanwhile, auth orities may need to make tough choices 
between: (i) financial stability and market integrity, (ii) efficiency and competition, and 
(iii) data privacy and consumer protection. It is important to find policies that can 
mitigate these trade-offs and allow priority  goals to be achieved simultaneously to 
the degree possible. In the next sections  we explore the implications for the 
regulatory perimeter, supervisory practices,  and competition, an d the relevant trade-
offs between the policies that authorities are adopting in practice.  
4.1 Implications for the regula tory perimeter and supervisory 
practices 
The growing diversity of financial serv ices providers and business models often 
requires expanding the regula tory perimeter. Payments, loans, and deposit taking 
services may be provided by specialized payment service providers (fintechs), 
e-commerce platforms (big techs), and other no n-banks. It is therefore important that 
regulators develop approaches to ensure  a level playing field and provide clear 
requirements for licensing. Similar activities  and similar risks should in principle be 
treated similarly, regardless of the market  participant, underlying technology, or 
method by which the service is provided. Yet in practice, a purely activities-based 
approach to regulation may not be sufficien t. Particularly the entry of big techs may 
require more, not less, entity-based regulation, for instance to address risks around 
competition and operational resilience (Restoy 2021). Expansion of the regulatory 
perimeter can ensure that activities are appropriately and comparably regulated and 
supervised (World Bank and IMF 2018; Alonso et al 2021; Ehrentraud et al 2020). This 
may extend to the perimeter of financial sa fety nets. Data reporting perimeters may 
need to be expanded even fu rther, given the disaggregation of finance and the 
embedding of financial services into non-fina ncial activities. The adoption of targeted 
regtech and suptech solutions may merit cons ideration by regulators as part of the 
policy response to fintech develop ments (Broeders and Prenio 2018).   
 
34 BIS Papers No 117
 Expanding the regulatory perimeter may be challenging in practice. Bringing new 
entities into the fold of financial regula tion may require legislative changes, which 
could be considered controversial and may be resisted by powerful interests with 
deep pockets, such as big techs. Ther e may be resistance to granting more 
discretionary powers to supervisors, ev en though such powe rs may be needed to 
continually adapt policy approaches to a changing sector. The challenges may be 
even more acute in EMDEs, where resource constraints make it more difficult to stay 
abreast of changes and to regu late powerful (foreign) serv ice providers. Yet emerging 
policy approaches in several jurisdictions show that applying an entity-based 
approach to new players such as big te chs may be possible (see section 4.2).  
The disaggregation and reconfiguration of  finance value chains introduces new 
challenges in day-to-day supervision. For a tr aditional, vertically integrated bank, it is 
clear where responsibility lies for the financial soundness, cybersecurity, and consumer impacts of a product. When the financial services value chain is spread 
across different players with, for example,  one holding the customer relationship, 
another holding the customer funds, a th ird providing data analytics and deciding 
which customers get services, and a fourth providing technology infrastructure, it is 
more difficult to pin down responsibility for mishaps or misdeeds and to ensure that 
consumers’ interests are protected. More over, when customer  interactions are 
handled by entities that are not directly  subject to extant consumer protection 
regulations, any shortcomin gs such as unfair practi ces may not surface through 
traditional supervision focused on the regu lated entity. This can lead to undetected 
consumer protection risks. This becomes even more challenging when services are 
provided across borders.  
Complex processes and interactions across different players and systems can 
create new points of failure. Multiple entiti es and interlinkages cr eate a wider attack 
surface for cybercriminals, which requires a strong regulatory approach to promote 
cyber security. The balance of power in these partnership relationships is very 
different than in a traditional outsourcing relationship, so the ability of the regulated financial institution to enforce its own policies might be challenging. Multi-tiered 
access to regulated systems, for exampl e through BaaS models, requires that 
regulators ensure that the BaaS provider has sufficient visibility through the value chain to ensure compliance. In some circumstances, regu lators may need to extend 
their supervision past the first-tier regu lated entity, downstre am to the customer 
interface entity or upstream to infrastructure providers. 
Reconfiguration of value chains is creating concentration risks at the technology 
services level that need to be monitored from both competition and systemic stability 
perspectives. The cloud services market is highly concentrated. While provision of services to financial institutions has long been subject to concentration (for example, 
limited numbers of mainframe, ATM, ca sh transport, and payments network 
providers), growing reliance by a large swath of the financial sector on a small number 
of cloud services providers has been fl agged as carrying the potential for new 
concentration or single-point-of-failure risks (FSB 2019b). Notably, four players 
control around two thirds of the global ma rket for cloud services (Graph 10). While 
cloud providers generally have deep expert ise in systems arch itecture and cyber 
security, an operational or cyber incident at one major cloud pr ovider could have 
systemic implications for the financial system (Danielsson and Macrae 2020). Open 
infrastructure, including API hubs, KYC utilities, and changing access policy for 
existing payment systems and credit re porting infrastructures, can mitigate 
concentration risks, increase contestability , and dilute data concentrations. However,  
 
BIS Papers No 117 35
 there are indicators that a number of B2B fintech services may be equally prone to 
concentration; the example of API middleware pr oviders cited earlier is a case in point.  
As authorities contemplate the regulatory and supervisory response to fintech, 
developments need to be examined in light of  the needs in each market. Some of the 
issues related to disaggregation and the in corporation of new players into financial 
product value chains can be addressed thro ugh regulatory guidan ce on governance 
of partnerships and outsourcing, including clear allocation of responsibilities and 
supervisory reporting, applied to each individual institution. Traditionally, regulators 
have placed responsibility for regulatory compliance with the licensed institution. However, as mentioned before, this may no t work in a scenario  where the licensed 
institution has much less scope to enforce sp ecific requirements – for example a small 
niche player partnering with a big tech or  using a global cloud provider. Thus, many 
challenges, such as up- or downstream conc entration risks, may need to be addressed 
at the sector level, eg through enhanc ed oversight of syst emically important 
providers. Further, regulatory authorit ies might need to increase their ongoing 
scrutiny of the operational and process mo del of licensed instit utions and introduce 
changes to ensure that they are able to discharge their co nsumer protection 
responsibilities. 
4.2 Implications for competition policy 
Concentration risks in financial service provision may increase under the central 
scenario outlined above. Digital platform pr oviders in particular may quickly achieve 
dominant positions. On its own, this need not have a detrimental effect on consumer 
choice and welfare, even if a small number  of dominant players reduces coordination 
barriers and may increase the risk of collusion. Provided switching costs remain low, 
markets can remain contestable and deliver beneficial outcomes – even in a barbell 
market structure. On the other hand, the conc entration of big data may result in data 
monopolies. Data-driven advantages of lar ger players can increa se switching costs 
and effectively lock in certain customers, and  ex post remedies for abuse of this 
customer lock-in may be difficu lt. In such cases ex ante remedies by the sectoral 
regulators on the ability to switch or inte roperability requirements are better suited. Market share of leading firms in the cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)

 Graph 11 compares ex ante sectoral regulations with ex post competition 
interventions. As an example, the largest two mobile payment providers in China 
reached a combined market share of 94% in 2019 (FSB 2019). The authorities were 
concerned that this could also pose severe systemic risks if one such provider were 
to be impaired. In 2018 the People’s Bank of China (PBC) implem ented a new mobile 
payment regulation requiring all mobile payments to be cleared through the PBC 
rather than settled internally within the mobile payment platform provider (Liu 2019). 
In this way, a sector-specific ex ante appr oach was able to addr ess concerns  rather 
than waiting for ex post correction.  
While overall financial services may remain competitive, in certain specific 
product segments monopolies or quasi-mo nopolies could emerge. Some services, 
such as exchanges, have inherent network and scale economies that could result in 
only a very few viable providers. While this  is not new, the entry of companies from 
adjacent spaces or the emb edding of financial services into non-financial products 
means the market structure of those industries becomes relevant. A monopoly utility 
or logistics company could require customers to use its embedded payment 
instrument. It could also embed working ca pital lines that could not be obtained by 
most customers from other le nders who do not have the data and leverage of these 
providers. This would allow th em to effectively dominate a financial services segment 
by virtue of the control held in the primary industry. The movement of highly Interplay of ex ante sectoral regulations and ex post interventions by competition

 concentrated mobile network operators into payments, often setting up their own 
proprietary agent networks, is an exam ple of how a player from concentrated 
adjacent market that is regulated with re spect to competition ca n carry that market 
structure over into a financial product area where the regulation was not attuned to that issue. Kenya provides a case study of regulatory response to  concentrated market 
structure and anticompetit ive behaviours in digital payments (see Box C).  
The proliferation of new products has no t always resulted in competition at all 
levels of the restructured value chains. The consumer-facing end of payments has become more diverse, with a range of wa llets, affinity and prepaid card programs, 
and embedded payments offerings. At the un derlying transaction processing level, 
though, there is an oligopoly in many ma rkets. In 2016, the UK Payment Systems 
Regulator (PSR) review ed the ownership and co mpetitiveness of infrastructure that 
supports the three majo r UK payment systems – BACS, Fa ster Payments Service, and 
LINK – and found there was no effective co mpetition for the provision of UK payments 
infrastructure (UK PSR 2016). Various measures were proposed to increase 
competition and remove barriers to entry.  Box C 
Competition in digital paym ents: the case of Kenya 
The Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) is a state corpor ation and was established by the Competition Act No. 12 
of 2010. It is mandated to promote and safeguard comp etition in the national econom y by effectively enforcing 
competition law and rules economy-wide, to  open markets by advocating for the removal of anticompetitive sector 
regulation, and to protect consumers and suppliers. CAK has intervened in a number of sector cases. With specific 
regard to the market for digital payments, the shapes below report the identified issues, the policy actions taken, and

 A similar challenge is emer ging in the context of op en banking and APIs. The 
back-end connection to APIs to facilitate da ta exchange is a high-volume, low-margin 
business. But since each bank may have different API specifications, it can be costly 
for a specific provider, such as a fintech start-up, to develop connections to everyone. 
Aggregation occurs at a middleware level th rough players like Plaid, Tink, and Yodlee. 
These are emerging as domi nant networks of API connections, a potentially 
oligopolistic layer at the choke point betw een more competitive segments. Even in 
markets where APIs are standa rdized, API hubs are emerging to simplify the interface 
requirements. 
While unbundling would tend to reduce anti-competitive product tying, re-
aggregation and embedding potentially put ty ing at the centre of financial product 
economics. In particular, platform models that combin e free services that have 
network effects with financial services migh t represent exactly the type of situation 
anti-trust authorities were concerned with in establishing anti-tying rules: that a 
monopoly provider of one service might requ ire customers to use its other products. 
Thus a dominant social network platform that has a quasi-monopoly position over small local businesses’ connections to thei r customers might embed payments in the 
social networking experience, and make it difficult for a customer to pay the business 
through anything other than the network’s payment product. The more dominant the 
social network, the more necessary it is for a business to be present on that platform, 
effectively reducing competition in paym ents acceptance. Dominant technology 
companies have already run afoul of anti-t ying regulations (eg Apple, Microsoft). 
While regulators have moved away from considering tying arrangements to be illegal 
per se, and focused more on rule-of-reason analysis that looks at both the benefits 
and potential costs of tying, these analyses are sure to be  tested as financial services 
tying moves from the ""traditional bank prod uct exception"" space to the sphere of big 
techs and embedded finance. 
Market structures that co ncentrate data and supercha rge network effects could 
reduce intermediation costs an d broaden inclusion. In ma ny markets, however, the 
resulting market power might be seen as more detrimenta l than these benefits. For 
example, in November 2020 the US Department of Justic e sued to block the proposed 
merger of Visa, a payments company, and Pl aid, a fintech data aggregation platform; 
the merger was abandoned in early 2021. Ch inese regulators have recently addressed 
concerns of anti-competitive practices that exclude compet itors in associated digital 
services such as e-commerce and social m edia when providing services to customers 
(McMorrow 2021). As in other industries, regulators will have to balance the 
efficiencies of natural monopolies against re straining market power. This is not a new 
consideration in financial services, but is ju st one of several trade-offs that become 
more pronounced as technology re -shapes financial services.  
Different societies will also attach different preferences to market structure 
outcomes. Regulatory policies governing entr y and scope of activity of new players, 
from small fintechs to big tech platforms,  will have profound effects on competitive 
dynamics both in financial services and in the core industries of  cross-over players. 
Fintech and big tech will require changes in the way that competition authorities and financial regulators interact, and calls for more coordination between regulators 
(Petralia et al 2019). Approaches to compet ition policy differ starkly across societies. 
Some societies may welcome market structures that concentrate data and supercharge network effects if they r educe intermediation costs and broaden 
inclusion. In other markets, the result ing market power might be seen as more 
detrimental than these benefi ts. Concentration of infrastr ucture and data in state  
 
BIS Papers No 117 39
 hands may be accepted in some societies, while others may be more concerned about 
potential extension of state surveillance. As in other industries, regulators will have to 
balance the efficiencies of natural monopolies against restraining market power. This 
is not a new consideration in financial servic es, but is just one of  several trade-offs 
that become more pronounced as technology re-shapes financial services.  
4.3 New dimensions to financia l regulation policy trade-offs 
Digital innovation may thus give rise to complex trade-offs between three categories 
of policy goals. These are: (i) financial stabilit y and market integrity; (ii) efficiency and 
competition; and (iii) data privacy and co nsumer protection. Graph 12 gives a visual 
representation of these trade- offs as a triangle. This final section discusses the three 
edges of the triangle in turn – and which types of policies authorities are applying to 
mitigate these trade-offs.  
Efficiency and competition vs financial stability and integrity 
Regulators have long debat ed the relationship between competition and financial 
stability. There are broadly two schools of thought on the competition-stability nexus 
(red arrow in Graph 12). One school of thou ght argues that greater market entry, or 
at least contestability, in the financial sector  is desirable, as it fosters competition and 
reduces incumbents’ market po wer. This can lead to gr eater efficiency and better 
outcomes for customers. It can also lead to more diversified activities (Amidu and 
Wolfe 2013) and fewer institutions that are individually systemically important and 
must be treated as “too-big-to-fail.” Syst emic importance can introduce governance 
challenges and moral hazard, as well as a fina ncial sector that is, on aggregate, larger 
than would be economically optimal (Feldman 2010). An al ternative school of thought 
emphasizes that greater comp etition is not always optimal or conducive to financial 
stability. Financial institutions that are more profitable may be able to accumulate Policy trade-offs from digita l transformation in finance Graph 12

40 BIS Papers No 117
 more equity capital, have a higher franchise value  and therefore act more prudently 
(Keeley 1990). This may occur at least up to a point where they incur moral hazard by 
becoming too big to fail. An implication may be that some barriers to entry are 
justified to help mitigate risks (Hellman et al 2000). This may be particularly true in a 
period of rapid market transition. New entr ants can target high-margin products, or 
skim off the most profitable customers, leaving incumbents with loss-making and 
riskier businesses. Regulators may view ma naging incumbents’ adjustments to either 
adoption of new technology, consolidation, or exit with a slower  pace of entry or 
dampened competition as more welfare-su staining than rapid and potentially 
disruptive exits. 
Fintech and big tech entry may turn some  existing insights on their head. In 
particular, the assumption that entry increases competition may no longer be true in 
an environment supercharged by the DNA f eedback loop (see Box B). While there is 
agreement that contestability matters grea tly for the overall degree of competition 
(Claessens 2009), and the reservoir of cont estants represented by the small niche 
services side of the barbell would tend to ma intain at least some competitive pressure 
on the larger players, big te chs with control over key digi tal platforms in e-commerce, 
search or social media may establish and entrench market powe r very quickly after 
entry. Such control may also  generate conflicts of intere st when both big techs and 
their competitors (eg banks) rely on the sa me core infrastructures such as networks 
or cloud computing services.  
The traditional focus of competition authorities on a single market, firm size, 
pricing and concentration may no longer be well suited to thes e market outcomes. 
Indeed, digital platforms that pu rsue growth over profits, and data over revenue, may 
not be well-captured by competition polic y approaches focusing on prices and 
consumer welfare (Khan 2017). While indica tors of market power like large market 
share and high margins provide useful first-order indication s, they are insufficient to 
determine whether a provider has market po wer and has the incent ives to abuse it. 
Moreover, the speed of changes to market st ructure presents cha llenges, as firms can 
go from “too small to care” to “too large to ignore” to “too big to fail” in only a few 
short years (Arner et al 2017). This was appa rent particularly with the growth of the 
big techs in China, but similar growth is bein g seen in many other markets, particularly 
EMDEs. Large foreign players in particular may become “too powerful to regulate and 
supervise.” Ex post remedial action, as with traditional antitrust and mergers policies, 
may not be sufficient to address risks.  
This may be a reason that some juri sdictions have upgraded their rules and 
methodologies for assessing and addressing anticompetitive conduct. In India, for 
example, the main e-commerce platform s are prohibited from selling products 
supplied by affiliated companies on their websites – including financial products – to 
avoid potential conflicts of interest (BIS  2019). In the EU, proposals for a Digital 
Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) include ex ante  requirements on 
“gatekeepers” to prevent self-preferencing and bundling or tying,  and requirements 
on “very large platforms” around reporting, risk assessment and crisis protocols 
(European Commission 2020a,b). In the UK, the Digital Competition Expert Panel (“Furman Report,” HM Treasury 2019) re commended the establishment of a digital 
markets unit to develop a competitive code of  conduct, enable gr eater personal data 
mobility and advance data openness. In the United States, a US House (2020) 
committee recommended rules to prevent di scrimination, favouritism, and self-
preferencing, and to strengthen antitrust la ws and enforcement. In China, meanwhile, 
the State Administration for Market Regulati on (SAMR) published draft guidelines on  
 
BIS Papers No 117 41
 antitrust measures for internet companies (including big techs) , proposing to block 
anticompetitive behaviours such as exclus ivity clauses, price discrimination and 
market barriers (Restoy 2021).14  
There could be stability challenges in a barbell outcome with respect to both 
large and small players. As in the tradit ional competition-stability nexus, greater 
franchise values may create incentives for large players to act pr udently and mitigate 
risk (such as those around cyber security, where the expertise of big techs is clear). 
However, systemic importance (too big to fail) may entail pressing risks to financial 
stability. Meanwhile, small, specialized play ers may help to serve specific market 
segments, but their lack of diversificatio n may also mean less stability. The niche 
providers would not have the diversificatio n to survive a demand shock affecting their 
segments, and a specific market segment dependent on only a few niche providers 
could be particularly hard hit when a spec ialized player exits. In  addition, costs to 
authorities to effectively supervise a large numb er of small entities is significant; this 
would be particularly burdensome for many EMDEs.  
Authorities may also need to revisit existing rules on the relationship between 
banking and commercial activities. In some jurisdictions (eg the UK and Japan), it is 
common for non-financial institutions to ow n financial institutions subsidiaries, while 
in others (eg the US) there is an explicit separation between banking and commerce.15 
As the boundaries between digital financial services and other services blur, there 
may be new challenges. For instance, would a big tech that partners with a small bank 
and provides financial services have indirect power to influence lending decisions without having to have an ownership stake? Can cross-subsidization of financial and 
non-financial services introduce systemic risks, either from the “real” or financial side 
of such links? These and fu rther aspects may require additional attention.  
Efficiency and competition vs privacy and consumer protection 
As data become an even more important source of market power, a trade-off 
between efficiency / competit ion and privacy / consumer pr otection arises. This is 
represented by the blue s egment in Graph 12, and has implications for financial 
inclusion and market structure.  
The massive volumes and types of data powering new financial services offerings 
have unique characteristics. On e special aspect of the use of big data as an input to 
production is that data can be used many times and by any number of firms 
simultaneously, without being depleted. This is referred to as “non-rivalry.” Data are 
often generated at zero marginal cost as a by-product of other digital services. Re-
use and exchange of data ca n generate large welfare gain s, but market mechanisms 
may result in re-use and exchange at be low optimal levels (World Bank 2021).  
The control by providers of their customers’ data maintains privacy but can 
reduce competition. The non-rivalry of data  can generate increasing returns for data 
in both scale and scope (Farboodi et al 2019;  Boissay et al 2021). Any single additional 
piece of data (eg payments information or a client’s review on a firm’s product) has 
 
14  Meanwhile, regulatory sandboxes ma y facilitate new entry into the ma rket. Cornelli et al (2020) show 
that in the UK, firms in the regulatory sandbox were able to attract greater funding given lower 
information asymmetries and regulatory costs.  
15  In China, rules stipulate that big techs may only hold a 30% share in financial institutions – hence the 
30% stake of Alibaba in Ant Grou p, and of Tencent in WeBank.   
 
42 BIS Papers No 117
 additional value when it is combined with an  already existing large stock of data. For 
this reason, data are more valuable to big tech firms and other firms with a wide range 
of business lines, giving rise to so-called digital monopolies. Data may thus become 
an “essential facility” in an antitrust sense. Fuelled by big data, algorithmic price discrimination is able to parse the popula tion of potential customers into finer and 
finer subcategories – each matched with a different price. Large multi-product 
providers could in principle capture the entire consumer surplus (Bar-Gill 2019).  
In the absence of privacy concerns, wider sharing of data could in principle be 
more efficient. If markets are competitive, it could be socially desirable to enable data 
sharing with providers able to make better  use of the data, for example as manifested 
by being able to sell a product to the cu stomer and therefore being willing to pay the 
data producer for access. This could incr ease efficiency and personalization and 
enhance competition and financial inclusion. This consideration has been an important driver behind open banking rule s, which allow customers to share their 
data between providers (eg banks and fint echs), and thus suppo rt competition.  
Privacy concerns are valid, however; free sh aring of data can harm individuals. In 
the case of personal data, open access to data can bring im portant costs, as 
individuals value their privac y (Acquisti et al 2019). Bank transaction data can be an 
important input into credit scoring decisi ons, and it can reveal a wide array of 
information about consumers’ preferences, buying habits, location and a host of 
other attributes, particularly when combined with other data sources. Open access to 
personal data can allow for identity theft, reputational  damage and the manipulation 
of behavioural biases to sell consumers products that are not in their interests – to 
name only a few examples (Ru and Schoar  2016). Open access across providers could 
also leave consumers worse off th rough high, personalized prices.
16 In insurance 
markets, greater data could allow for more  granular pricing, thus undermining the 
risk pooling or solidarity function of insurance (IAIS 2017).  
Control over personal data may be subject to market failures. These come about 
as data are non-rival and only partially  excludable (Carrière-Swallow and Haksar 
2019), and due to challenges in obtaining re liably informed consent. This can invite 
too much data sharing (Acemoglu et al 2021) , hoarding of data, too little investment 
in cyber-security, and fragmentation across borders. While it would in principle be 
optimal to define “property rights” over da ta – a decentralized or “Coasian” solution, 
in line with Coase’s classic th eory of property rights (Coase 1960) – this may not be 
easily applied in practice. In particular, large, multi-product institutions may have 
access to types of data that others do no t have, and given returns to scale and scope 
they may be able to bid more  for such data than specialis t providers. Thus, data can 
be the source of further comp etitive distortions. In additi on, consumers cannot always 
fully process available information, and th e information available when they grant 
 
16  In a recent paper Brunnermeier et al. (2020) argue that big data an d machine learning invert adverse 
selection problems. Artificial intelligence allows insu rers to infer many statistical insights from the 
insurance customer and thereby reverses the information advantage from the customer to the insurer. This determines an “inv erse selection.” A customer know s her multiple attributes, but a 
platform and only a platform ca n connect them. Given this comparative advantage, the insurer can 
try to protect its statistical information by offering only a few screening contracts. In this case, forcing the insurance company to reveal its statistical information to the customer can be welfare-improving. 
Their research shows indeed that in a setting with naïve agents that do not perfectly infer statistical 
information from the price of offered contracts, pr ice discrimination significantly boosts insurers’ 
profits.

 ‘consent’ may be incomplete. This could result in consumers over-sharing, or under-
valuing their own data  property rights.  
Given the network effects underlying comp etition, the competitive playing field 
may be levelled more effectively by placin g well-designed limits on  the use of data. 
Introducing some additional rules regarding privacy – while at the same time allowing 
selectively for the sharing of some type s of data – could increase effective 
competition, because the additi on of such limitations on the use of data could curb 
big techs’ exploitation of network effect s. Just as governments have decided that 
certain information – such as gender or pre-existing medi cal conditions – cannot be 
used in the pricing of health insurance contracts, there ma y be a need for legislatures 
to define types of personal da ta that cannot be used in cr edit decisions or other types 
of financial services. Moreover, policies ma y be needed to give individuals greater 
control over their data. Jones and Tonetti (2020) show in a theoretical model that 
endowing individuals with data rights may le ad to outcomes that are close to optimal. 
Design of such policies must also recognize that mandating data sharing could 
reduce incentives to produce high quality da ta, or to provide valuable services that 
depend on the provider monetizing data (World Bank 2021).  
Data mobility requirements may also he lp to mitigate trade-offs. Work on 
consumer data rights in the EU, Australia and Canada are examples of steps in this 
direction. Proposals on data mobility ar e also included in the EU DMA and DSA 
proposals and the UK Digital Competition Ex pert Panel (2019). Making data “portable” 
across providers and increasing data subjects’ control of their data could help to allow 
the efficient uses of data while preventing  data monopolies from arising. While some 
types of data (eg genome data, social cont acts) may still be judged “off-limits” for use 
in financial services, the ability to port permissible data between different providers 
may allow for efficiency an d competition in a way that empowers and benefits 
consumers, reducing rents by providers.  
Beyond data privacy, new entrants ar e often shifting credit, market, and 
operational risks to consumers with limited validation of informed consent or product appropriateness. Marketplace finance platforms were initially designed as a 
regulatory arbitrage, gath ering funds through a non-deposit mechanism to avoid 
being termed a bank. The platforms introduc ed competition to banks, reducing costs 
to borrowers, and offering higher yields to  investors. The increased efficiency of the 
platforms, stems in part from the reduc ed regulatory overhead, minimal required 
capital, and absence of deposit insurance premiums (some P2P platforms do set aside 
funds to self-insure). Investors in many marketplaces have looked at P2P as an 
alternative to bank savings products, but in most cases they bear direct credit risk 
without any type of deposit insurance, an d often are not aware of that risk. Robo-
advisors and gamified trading platforms expo se consumers to market risks from new 
instruments with which they may have limit ed familiarity. Cryptocurrencies have been 
subject to volatility risk that might not be  anticipated by those seeking to use them 
for payments. DLT-based payments embed operational risks with respect to the 
exchanges, and even th e underlying consensus mechanisms, that are not always well 
understood. While Stablecoins seek to addre ss volatility against a pa rticular basket of 
currencies, they fundamentally alter the pr otection for the holder by removing the 
guarantee of redemption at  par that e-money issuer s and banks provide their 
customers. Increased usage of digital me ans of communication between providers 
and customers might expose th e customers to clever social  engineering attacks. The 
increased speed of processing of transactions  affords little or no time to rectify any 
mistakes by customers.

 Regulators need to balance the innovation and efficien cy introduced by broader 
competition with the potential dampening e ffects of consumer pr otection oversight 
and enforcement. Much depends, as with da ta privacy, on whether consent can be 
adequately ‘informed’ and whether there are reliable objective tests for product 
suitability. The challenge of protecting the consumer will become more acute as the 
consumer takes on more direct roles in assembling, and even providing, financial 
services (eg unintermediated P2P). Depending on how the regulatory perimeter is set, 
new approaches to disclosure, determining  product appropriateness, and informed 
consent need to be developed to ensure the promise of increased efficiency does not 
come at the cost of custom er losses and reduced trust. 
Privacy and consumer protection vs financial stability and integrity 
Data sharing can alleviate problems of as ymmetric information and thus could be 
beneficial for financial stability and integrity. This potentially introduces a new trade-
off between privacy (and consumer protec tion more generally) on the one hand and 
financial stability and market integrity on th e other. This trade-off is represented by 
the green segment in Graph 12. 
In the credit market, there is ample eviden ce that more data can improve stability. 
Credit registries (CRs), for instance, can counter adve rse selection and reduce 
information asymmetry between lenders an d borrowers. CRs allow loans to be 
extended to safe borrowers who had prev iously been priced out of the market, 
resulting in higher aggregate lending (Pagano and Jappelli 1993) and furthering 
financial inclusion. They can also counter moral hazard by increasing borrowers’ cost 
of default, thus increasing debt re payment (Padilla and Pagano 2000).17 Conversely, 
sharing of credit-related information has the benefit of reduci ng the information 
monopoly a lender has on its borrowers. For example, banks with long-standing 
relationships with their borrowers have ex clusive information that allows them to 
charge higher interest rates and extract ot her rents from those high-quality borrowers 
(Padilla and Pagano 1997). CR s can counter this. Finally , they can reduce over-
indebtedness by revea ling borrowers’ debt exposure to  all participating lenders, 
leading informed borrowers to extent them less credit (Bennardo, Pagano and Piccolo 
2015). Brown and Zehnder (2007) show that an  information sharing institution helps 
lenders avoid serious losses from short term borrowers. 
As the experience with credit registries shows, this is not without its downsides 
for consumers. In the United  States, for instance, consum er advocates have criticized 
systems that screen for past overdraft fees  and allow banks to deny account services 
to individuals (Baradaran 2015). Transparency in how personal data are used, and 
recourse in the event of misuse, provi de some mitigation for these potential 
exclusionary effects. A large body of r egulations has allowed borrowers to gain 
insights into their personal  credit score and the informat ion collected about them. In 
a world of digital innovation, in which a mu ch wider range of data is available for 
screening, there may be an even higher premium on givi ng individuals such access 
and rights, commensurate with the growing im pact of providers’ use of individuals’ 
data on availability of services.  
 
17  Doblas-Madrid and Minetti (2013) fi nd that if lenders enter a credit  information shar ing institution, 
their borrowers improve their repayment performance – delinquent payments on leases and loans 
decrease.  
 
BIS Papers No 117 45
 For example, there are concer ns that opaque algorithmic processing of personal 
data in banking could result in biases an d discrimination. AI/ML-based credit scoring 
is supposed to reduce the in cidence of non-performing loans, thereby contributing 
to stability. However, sophisticated ML algorithms may not be as neutral as their mathematical nature suggests  at first glance. While less human intervention means 
that taste-based discrimination may dec line, algorithms devel oped by humans or 
trained on historical data can introduce new biases (Morse and Pence 2020). Using 
data on US mortgages, Fuster et al (2019) find that Black and Hispanic borrowers are 
disproportionately less likely to gain from the introduction of machine learning in 
credit scoring models. This suggests that  the algorithm may develop differential 
effects across groups and increase inequa lity (Graph 13, left-hand panel). Borrowers 
to the left of the solid vertical line repres ent “winners,” who are classified as less risky 
by the more sophisticated algorithm than by the traditional model. Based on the 
cumulative share, about 65% of White Non- Hispanic and Asian borrowers would win, 
compared with about 50% of Black and Hispan ic borrowers. In another study, fintech 
does not seem able to close the gender gap in access to financial services, as women 
have a lower propensity to share data than men. Chen et al (2021) find that men are 
more likely to use fintech product services than women (27% vs 19%) and that this 
pattern holds in every country (except for Pe ru and India; Graph 13, right-hand panel). 
Moreover, women report being more worried about their security  when dealing with 
companies online, and less willing to share data  for better offers on financial services.  
Reducing illicit activity is another area wh ere use of personal data can potentially 
improve stability and market integrity, but carry costs in terms of privacy and financial 
exclusion. For example, anti-money laun dering (AML) and comb ating the financing 
of terrorism (CFT) practices require the exch ange of detailed information on all parties 
involved in a financial transaction. This could result in exclusion of individuals who cannot present sufficient docu mentation or have not had prior access to demonstrate 
positive patterns that the screening mechanisms  may seek. The data analysis may 
reveal habits and preferences that are not re lated to illicit activity but are nonetheless 
sensitive or personal. Since sanctions monitoring, KYC remediation, AML measures, 
and transaction monitoring are among the most expensive elements of compliance 
by banks, the motivation to use advanc ed data analytics is  strong. Increased 
automation and use data gener ated at low marginal cost could drive down costs and 
enable more low income customers to be accredited. However, a general raising of 
the bar as data coverage of the more active  and/or high income customers improves 
will exacerbate the data divide relative to  previously excluded segments. Tiered KYC 
requirements attempt to address this as a way of balancing data  coverage and market 
integrity requirements.  
Discussions around central bank digi tal currencies put these issues into 
particularly sharp focus. Some central banks,  such as the People’s Bank of China, are 
considering CBDC architectures in which th e central bank will have full access to 
transactions data so as to support AML/CFT and prudential supervision. Other central 
banks are leaning against having access to such data, and looking into so-called 
“intermediated” options where private sector  intermediaries keep such data and the 
central bank only has a ledger of wholesal e transactions (Auer et al 2020b; Carstens 
2021). Given the stark divergence in prefer ences for privacy-stab ility tradeoffs across 
different jurisdictions, it is possible that fi nal designs may also differ in this regard.  
   
 
46 BIS Papers No 117
 Addressing these trade-offs, too, will r equire a societal discussion on data 
sharing. Data protection rule s like the EU General Data Pr otection Regulation (GDPR) 
and California Consumer Protection Act (CCP A) have represented important steps in 
protecting privacy and limiting data use based on consumer consent. Yet further 
debate will be needed to determine under wh ich circumstances privacy rules may be 
relaxed to improve stability and integrity, and how consumers can be protected from 
algorithmic discrimination. This remains a frontier issue in policymaking in the 
financial sector and the digital economy mo re generally, where di fferent jurisdictions 
may continue learning from one another goin g forward.  
5. Conclusions 
This paper has shown that digital innova tion is bringing about economically 
meaningful changes in the production of fi nancial services, with implications for the 
industrial structure of fi nance. Improvements in connectivity  and computing  can help 
to enhance efficiency and competition. In many cases, financial services have seen an 
un-bundling of different products and services. At the same time, financial frictions  
and forces  that drove the need for financial interm ediators in the first place have re-
asserted themselves. The financial sector may be tending toward a barbell outcome 
in market structure, in which large multi- product institutions exist alongside more 
specialized niche institutions. 
Regulatory and supervisory policy tools w ill have to adapt. Existing regulatory 
perimeters may not adequately cover emergi ng providers of financial services, and 
new players may pose challenges for day- to-day financial supervision. It is 
increasingly challenging to balance compet ition and stability, both among financial 
services providers and across myriad player s in reconfigured financial product value Winners and losers of machine learning credit scoring and the fintech gender gap Graph 13

 chains. Rules for control over data, and whic h data are allowable fo r specific services, 
will need to be defined – ideally in a way th at gives individuals control, balances 
competition and efficiency with privacy and consumer protec tion, and enhances 
financial inclusion. New forms of discrimi nation and bias will need to be understood 
and countered. A new balance will have to be struck across consumer protection, 
privacy considerations and stability and integrity in a way that respects societal 
preferences in different jurisd ictions around the world, and within different societies. 
Monetary policy, systemic stability, and consumer protection tools, which have been 
left largely beyond the scope of this pa per, may also need to adapt. Challenges 
include access to lender of last resort programs by new providers, stabilizing credit 
markets in which non-bank players become major lenders, and maintaining the viability of deposit insurance programs where new players become large.  
Authorities need to be intentional with re spect to market stru cture. Prior notions 
around the trade-offs between competitio n and stability need to be re-examined. 
Longstanding precepts on the separation of banking and commerce are already being 
upended. Existing approaches to competit ion policy and antitrust may not be well-
suited to digital financial services, where measures of pricing and concentration for 
one market or firm may have become less informative. The nature of contestability 
must be understood anew in markets driven by increasing returns to scale but also 
increasingly low entry barriers for niche se rvices. The desirability of a barbell market 
configuration will depend in part on consum er behaviours and skills that determine 
switching costs in a given market. Market forces are already being shaped by 
minimum capital, licensing requirements, activity restrictions and other policies. 
Pretending that market forces are just runni ng their course is inaccurate at best, and 
at worst could lead to negative outcomes for consumers and macro stability.  
Several authorities are taking promising policy measures to mitigate trade-offs. 
Recent entity-based measures around big tech s, such as the proposals in the EU, UK, 
US and China can take a more ex ante approach to addre ss risks, prevent 
anticompetitive behaviours, an d in the process promote a level playing field. Data 
privacy protections and data mobility requir ements can support consumer protection 
and may also promote compet ition. Still, a societal debate will be needed on what 
types of data should be permissible for us e in financial services and when privacy 
rules can be relaxed in the service of stability.  
To tread into this new territory effectively, and to balance the necessary policy 
goals, authorities will need to collaborate. At the domestic level, central banks and 
other financial sector regulators need to c ooperate with industry  regulators (eg for 
telecoms and other utilities that may offer financial services) as well as competition 
and data protection authorities. At the international level, authorities are working together to share expertise on financial regulation of both new entrants and 
incumbents, and to coordinate policies. This becomes ever more important given the 
cross-border spillovers of anti-trust and da ta governance decisions, and the potential 
to improve service efficiency through harm onization of standards in areas such as 
cybercrime prevention, data protection, and interoperability (World Bank 2021). 
Collaboration can help to ensure regulato ry consistency and peer learning between 
countries, and ultimately higher welfare for their populations.

The advertising and marketing industry is constantly evolving, facing unprecedented disruption and trans -
formation as new technologies emerge. For leaders in this space, it’s crucial to stay informed of the latest 
trends in order to understand how they will impact future strategic decisions. 
It is imperative to look beyond consideration of what is trending and into why the trends are relevant 
now. Trends may be inspired by or change as technology changes but people are at the heart of what the 
marketing and advertising industry is all about. In order to move hearts and minds, and shift behavior to 
drive a specific outcome, it’s important to first understand consumer behavior, their preferences and what 
drives them. 
Trend Hunter is a go-to source for spotting emerging consumer trends before they hit the mainstream. 
To identify what is trending, they use a methodology that relies on their global online community; Trend 
Hunter crowdsources thousands of ideas which are then tracked, scored, and crowd-filtered through a 
combination of their 250 million-person focus group and our proprietary machine-learning tool. This fil -
tered data turns into custom trend reports offering relevant insights into what consumers want across 
a multitude of industries. 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) knows advertising and marketing: with a comprehensive set of pur -
pose-built AWS Services, AWS Solutions, and over 150+ AWS Partner offerings to help customers inno-
vate faster, operate efficiently, and interoperate together across 5 solution areas: Audience and Customer

Business Trend 1: 
First-party data 
activation is 
paramount in the 
privacy-conscious 
consumer era.
SIMPLICITY
The Simplicity Megatrend explores why consum-
ers value the power of omission in a world over-
flowing with choices. Consumers are constantly 
connected, leaving them overwhelmed. The irony 
is, this connectivity results in increased consum -
er data they share in exchange for convenience. 
This transaction -- data in exchange for simplified, 
streamlined experiences -- is core to consumers in 
the digital age.
Concerns around privacy are therefore essential in 
that consumers do not want to be the ones to solve 
for this issue. Recent data privacy regulation poli -
cies like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation 
Act) and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy 
Act) outline ways organizations can satisfy the 
consumer desire for safe data usage. Achieving a 
delicate balance between convenience and privacy 
has become imperative.6
TECHNOLOGY TREND 1:   
First Party Data Activation 
requires Privacy-
enhancing tools
In today’s data-driven world, first-party data has become an essential tool for marketers looking to effec-
tively reach and engage their target audiences. There is certainly no shortage of data, as an estimated 2.5 
quintillion bytes of data are created each day according to Forbes. Leveraging first-party data to its full 
potential requires marketers to lay a solid data foundation with robust identity resolution and data collab -
oration capabilities. Data is at the center of every application, process, and business decision, and is the 
cornerstone of almost every organization’s digital transformation, fuelling new experiences and leading 
to insights that spur innovation. According to Forrester , advanced insights-driven businesses are 8.5 
times more likely than beginners to report at least 20% revenue growth. Gartner also notes that only 14% 
of companies have a 360-view of the consumer. Additionally, less than 5% use this view to systemically 
grow their business. Getting ahead of this trend creates a unique opportunity for businesses, with leading 
enterprises continuously moving the management of their first party data in-house because it represents 
a competitive advantage.
Identity resolution is defined as “the process of accurately associating data with people who interact with 
your business” ( Informatica ), and it is important to address the need to create a single, accurate view of 
each customer across various data sets. Records containing information about customers, businesses, 
or products are increasingly fragmented and siloed across applications, channels, and data stores, mak -
ing it difficult for organizations to link related records together to create a singular view and gain better in -
sights. Despite this, almost every business needs to create a cohesive understanding of their customers 
and prospects across all consumer touchpoints and data sources in order to effectively grow revenue via 
customer growth, retention and acquisition. A unified view of the consumer enables segmentation and 
more efficient processing, boosting marketing, advertising and customer experiences. These consumer 
interactions generate data that iteratively feed back into a customer’s unified profile, providing the foun -
dation to deliver personalized and connected consumer campaigns, experiences and journeys. 
Without strong identity resolution, marketers risk communicating with customers through inconsistent, 
irrelevant messages that damage brand perception, with 60% of marketers saying their biggest challenge 
is in connecting the dots across omnichannel customer journeys ( IAB). Most work with an identity data 
service provider to resolve identities in real-time to maintain a persistent understanding of customers 
interactions across channels.
Likewise, data collaboration tools that enable privacy-enhancing data processing both within organiza -
tions and with partners are pivotal enablers of first-party data activation. External data partnerships can 
also be leveraged by marketers to uncover unique insights and growth opportunities for better overall 7
consumer experiences. However, navigating data collaboration introduces more challenging privacy, se -
curity and governance concerns. Organizations must implement proper permissions, consent flows, and 
data anonymization to handle data ethically and maintain customer trust. That is why the most success -
ful businesses facilitate controlled data sharing that balances value creation with privacy protection.
A data clean room helps businesses and their partners more easily and securely analyze and collaborate 
on their collective datasets–without sharing or copying each other’s underlying data. Data clean rooms 
also help businesses collaborate with other organizations to generate unique insights about advertising 
campaigns, investment decisions, and research and development. Without robust identity resolution 
and data collaboration capabilities built into the marketing data stack, first-party data risks becoming an 
unused, underutilized asset. Thoughtful identity hygiene and strategic data partnerships prime first-party 
data for advanced targeting, personalization and measurement use cases that drive remarkable custom -
er experiences. With clean, unified customer profiles and ethical data collaboration unlocking rich behav-
ioral and contextual insights, organizations gain the understanding of customers necessary to activate 
first-party data to its full potential. The businesses that invest in a strong data foundation with these now 
will gain an advantage in using first-party data to deepen customer relationships over the long-term.
Notable Examples:
AWS Entity Resolution  and partner solutions  offer 
capabilities to help companies easily match, link, 
and enhance related records across applications, 
channels, and data stores. Entity Resolution offers 
advanced matching techniques such as rule-based, 
machine learning (ML)-powered, and data service 
provider matching including built-in integrations 
with LiveRamp, TransUnion, and the open source 
framework UID2, which enable customers to more 
accurately link and enhance related records of cus -
tomer information across first and third party data 
sets. For example, customers can use AWS Entity 
Resolution to more easily create a unified view of 
customer interactions by linking recent events (e.g., 
ad clicks, cart abandonment, and purchases) with 
pseudonymized signals from their data service 
providers into a unique entity ID.
LiveRamp RampID™  - Their identity resolution and 
translation capabilities make them a data collab -
oration platform of choice for the world’s most 
innovative businesses. As a leader in consumer 
privacy, data ethics, and enterprise identity, Liv-
eRamp is setting a new standard for building a 
connected customer view with unmatched clarity and context while protecting brand and consumer 
trust by enabling customers to extend their consol -
idated audience profiles with RampID™, LiveRamp’s 
durable, privacy-centric identifier for connecting 
the digital ecosystem. LiveRamp offers flexibility to 
collaborate wherever data lives to support a wide 
range of data collaboration use cases—within orga-
nizations, between brands, and across its premier 
global network of top-quality partners. Hundreds 
of global innovators, from iconic consumer brands 
and tech giants to banks, retailers, and healthcare 
leaders turn to LiveRamp to build enduring brand 
and business value by deepening customer en-
gagement and loyalty, activating new partnerships, 
and maximizing the value of their first-party data 
while staying on the forefront of rapidly evolving 
compliance and privacy requirements.
TransUnion TruAudience® This identity product 
line brings advanced identity resolution capabil -
ities to customers, improving their data hygiene, 
and customer insights while helping to better 
protect their data by minimizing its movement, 
as it reads records where they already live. This 
matching workflow which is integrated into AWS 
Entity Resolution helps marketers to directly ac-
cess TransUnion’s high quality data, ID graph, and 8
machine learning capabilities to drive advanced 
identity resolution use-cases, including verifying, 
correcting and deduplicating first-party data to 
more effectively reach customers, linking discon -
nected data sets across customer touchpoints to 
ensure consistent and relevant experiences and 
enriching data with new insights to help marketers 
better understand their customers.
UID2  Framework – The Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) frame-
work provides double encryption of email or phone 
number CRM data for use across the digital ad -
vertising ecosystem facilitating audience creation, 
targeting and measurement use cases. The privacy 
and security-conscious nature of UID2
protects CRM data while being transported be -
tween partners and platforms and through the bid
stream. Only participants with authorized keys can 
generate or decrypt UID2s, with express permission 
by the data owner. Personally identifiable attributes 
are isolated and encrypted so they are inaccessi -
ble without authorized keys. Access is encrypted 
and audited through security controls built into 
AWS. For entity resolution, trusted matching ser -
vices leverage encrypted personally identifiable 
attributes to determine if two UID2s represent the 
same real-world identity. This allows coordination 
across services without exposing raw identifiers 
like email addresses. Matching is policy-controlled 
and uses anonymization techniques like bloom 
filters for additional privacy. The UID2 framework 
aims to improve interoperability and privacy, as an 
upgrade to identity across digital ecosystems.AWS Clean Rooms – AWS Clean Rooms helps mar -
keters and data analysts to more securely collabo-
rate with their partners to perform joint data anal -
ysis, without having to share their underlying data 
with each other. Clean Rooms enable more effec-
tive data activation while helping maintain data pro-
tection and security. By facilitating privacy-enhanc-
ing data analyses, AWS Clean Rooms empower 
marketers to gain valuable insights from a broader 
set of data to better understand their customers 
and optimize marketing strategies and campaigns. 
Data collaboration is therefore a critical capability 
for marketers seeking to fully leverage the value of 
their first party data assets together with insights 
from their partners’ data. 9
Implications for Marketers:
Respecting data privacy regulations
According to TechCruch , “data is the world’s most valuable (and vulnerable) 
resource.” With growing data privacy needs, regulations like the General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are and California Consumer Privacy Act 
(CCPA) are putting user consent and transparency in focus. Marketers will 
need to carefully balance data collection and personalization with privacy. 
Strategies like privacy by design and zero-party data, can help build consumer 
trust. Zero-party data is “that which a customer intentionally and proactively 
shares with a brand” and “can include preference center data, purchase inten -
tions, personal context, and how the individual wants the brand to recognize 
[them].” (Forrester )  The regulatory environment will likely remain complex, 
making privacy manuals and consent management essential. With sound 
data governance, marketers can still gain insights while respecting user 
preferences. Additionally, until zero-party data as an option for consumers 
becomes mainstream, first-party data, gathered from user interactions with 
a brand’s websites, apps, or physical stores, will continue to offer indirect 
insights into consumer behavior.
Partner with Service Providers
According to a recent DemandGen survey, “96% of businesses anticipated 
a yearly rise in revenue that can be attributed directly to marketing efforts 
carried out within their partner networks.” In seeking to better solidify a data 
strategy approach that involves keeping up with these newer technology 
trends, advertisers and marketers are increasingly looking to partner with 
experts who can help guide and support implementation and management 
across the various data service providers, technology solutions and media 
publications. Check out AWS service providers like Deloitte Digital, Slalom, 
Merkle, and Capgemini. See data collaboration partners here. 
 
Boosting investment in privacy-enhancing tech for  
responsible growth
Advertisers and marketers require trusted consumer data for making sound 
investment decisions, including emerging technologies like privacy-enhancing 
data solutions. Building a strong data foundation begins with understanding 
what data is needed for what purpose, how it is collected, where and how it 
is stored, evaluating new tools like identity resolution or data collaboration, 
making informed choices on implementation, and demonstrating the value of 
these investments to key stakeholders within an organization.1

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
 
Artificial Intelligence, as a Megatrend, embodies 
the concept that technology’s primary purpose is 
to accelerate human progress. This aligns with the 
intrinsic human desire for continuous advance-
ment, where complacency is not merely a threat 
to success but to our very survival. In this way, the 
AI Megatrend applies to more than literal artificial 
intelligence technologies. It embodies your average 
consumers’ attitude toward technology, which is to 
care less about what the technology actually is and 
how it works, and more about how it improves their 
lives and increases their own capabilities.
The increasing popularity of generative AI exempli-
fies this and its emergence represents an inflection 
point, greatly increasing both the access and appli -
cation of AI. Generative AI “describes algorithms 
that can be used to create new content, including 
audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos” 
(McKinsey & Company ). Like all AI, it is powered by 
machine learning (ML) models that are pre-trained 
on vast amounts of data and commonly referred to 
as foundation models. Generative AI represents a 
transformative leap forward, unlocking “a new set 
of opportunities for businesses and professionals 
that perform content creation,” ( Harvard Business 
Review). It also marks a pivotal shift in how tech -
nology can empower consumers to push boundar-
ies, by extending its reach not only into new indus -
tries, but also into the daily lives of consumers.Business Trend 2: 
With increased 
accessibility, Generative AI 
will transform advertising 
and marketing processes.11
Generative AI will define a new normal in what consumers come to expect as recipients of advertising or 
as targets of marketing campaigns. Consumers will come to expect a new level of personalization–from 
the use of the technology powering customized content–and these expectations will set increasingly 
higher demands for businesses to perform effectively.
Marketers are always trying to keep pace with changing customer expectations and demands, to meet 
customers where they are, and where they are going to be. These marketing automations and person -
alization will play an increasingly outsized role in structuring how customers understand and relate to a 
brand, and to the specific products/services that brand provides. In other words, the stakes here are not 
just who pulls ahead of their peers, but who falls behind and int o the risk of irrelevancy.
Rather than viewing generative AI as a replacement for marketing talent, we should recognize that it en -
ables new talent and enhances existing expertise. As process automation increases, marketers will shift 
toward higher-value tasks, emphasizing creativity and expertise. This will allow businesses to allocate 
marketing resources more effectively, with an increased emphasis on planning and strategy over tactics. 
Successful marketers will use AI as part of their strategic engagement, not as a replacement for it. At the 
same time, advertisers and marketers will use generative AI as a more effective market research tool. AI’s 
ease of digestion and model tuning will revolutionize research, providing insights into the behaviors and 
motivations of both prospect and consumer. For example, it will simplify data extraction and correlation, 
leading to refinements in lookalike modeling. This, in turn, will enable marketers to create better customer  
taxonomies, segmentations for their customers, and product-market fit, ultimately benefiting generative 
AI advertising efforts.
Digital marketing has always been about seizing the most opportune moments to deliver engaging con -
tent to drive purchasing decisions. Historically, this goal has been challenged by the time-consuming na -
ture of processing information, leading to missed opportunities. AI and ML ’s ability to ingest and process 
information in milliseconds has enabled new solutions, enabling retail data insights in real time, leading 
to more timely campaigns and better alignment with customer preferences.
The other challenge to delivering the right message at the right moment is that even if you can identify 
the moment, there exists a bottleneck around content production. By the time human agents receive the 
relevant information, and craft a relevant response, the moment might have passed. A customer might be 
distracted or induced into a competing product funnel. With the possibilities of generative AI, prospects 
can be engaged by personalized, automated copy, video, display ads, and more, without missing the TECHNOLOGY TREND 2:   
Generative AI Boosts 
Innovation12
Notable Examples:
Amazon Bedrock  – is an easy way for customers 
to build and scale generative AI-based applications 
using FMs, democratizing access for all builders. 
Amazon Bedrock makes FMs from Amazon and 
leading AI startups including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, 
Cohere, Meta and Stability AI accessible through 
an API. Bedrock offers the ability to access a range 
of powerful FMs for text and images—including 
Amazon Titan FMs, which consist of two new 
large language models (LLMs)—through a scal -
able, reliable, and secure AWS managed service. 
Bedrock supports secure customization—keeping 
customers’ data private and secure. Customers 
simply point Bedrock at a few labeled examples in 
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and 
the service can fine-tune the model for a particular 
task without having to annotate large volumes of 
data (as few as 20 examples is enough).
Omnicom  – Omnicom was a first-mover to collabo-
rate with AWS, leveraging AWS’s generative AI and 
industry-leading cloud infrastructure. It integrated 
Amazon’s Bedrock and Trainium chips into Om-
nicom’s proprietary Omni operating system. Bed -
rock’s powerful foundation models and Trainium’s 
optimized ML performance will supercharge Om -
ni’s capabilities. Campaign elements like creative briefs, media plans, ad creative and more can be 
generated and optimized at unbelievable speeds. 
Tasks that previously required whole teams of 
people may soon be automated. This frees up hu -
man time and resources for higher value work. For 
marketers, it means better insights, experiences 
and performance. Omnicom plans to create pro-
prietary foundation models optimized specifically 
for advertising use cases. This will provide their 
teams an advantage leveraging AI that is tailored 
to their needs. Working with AWS, Omnicom will 
advance its AI-powered platform Omni – an open 
operating system which today uses AWS to ingest 
trillions of advertising signals monthly and store 
more than 14 petabytes of data – by creating new 
foundational models that help automate activities 
such as developing creative briefs, media plans, ad 
creative, audience segmentation, and performance 
measurement.
Credera, an agency within the Omnicom Precision 
Marketing Group (OPMG), is now offering genera-
tive AI as a service including generative AI content 
creation, customer journey modeling and optimiza -
tion, customized large language models (LLM) with 
enterprise fine tuning, expert augmentation through 
AI co-pilots, and computer vision offerings that 
train AI learning systems to understand images 
and videos to automate tasks that previously relied 
on human vision.moment. Imagine digital video that retargets a customer based on their own travel preferences, integrat-
ing recently searched destinations, preferred hotels in those areas, and tourist or travel packages, all in 
one seamlessly generated and compelling video ad. With AI to collate increasing amounts of data, we 
will not only see better product-market fit, but also better product and server experiences, which will lay 
the groundwork for the next generation of market defining offerings. Imagine more granular information 
than what is currently available through rudimentary focus group or conjoint analysis, based on which 
functions yield higher marketing return on investment, or faster development planning cycles, thanks to 
improved efficiency collecting voice of the customer from retention marketing campaigns.
Of course, marketing doesn’t end with a customer using a product, nor does it end with them being sat -
isfied with that product. Rather, retention-based marketing is built on understanding customer sentiment 
and the reasons for customer satisfaction. By using AI tools and processes to gather, collate, and analyze 
data about customer sentiments, marketers and product teams alike can better understand the drivers of 
satisfaction, which can then be used as part of marketing efforts, or in iterative product design.

Coca-Cola “Masterpiece” Campaign - Coca-Cola 
is at the forefront of harnessing the potential of 
generative AI to elevate its marketing strategies. 
In a notable move, the company appointed Pratik 
Thakar as its Global Head of Generative AI, a clear 
testament to its dedication to integrating artificial 
intelligence into its marketing initiatives. This stra-
tegic decision underscores the brand’s belief in AI’s 
transformative capacity to reshape customer en-
gagement and advertising. Furthermore, Coca-Cola 
has introduced a visually captivating AI-generated 
advertising campaign  titled “Masterpiece”. This 
groundbreaking endeavor takes classical art mas -
terpieces and infuses them with a contemporary 
twist, breathing new life into timeless works of art. 
What sets this campaign apart is an accompany -
ing virtual gallery platform, inviting consumers to 
explore AI-generated artwork crafted by emerging 
artists in collaboration with the brand. This innova-
tive approach not only redefines the boundaries of 
artistic creativity but also strengthens Coca-Cola’s 
engagement with its audience. By embracing gen -
erative AI, the brand not only pioneers the fusion 
of technology and art but also cultivates a deeper 
connection with consumers through immersive and 
visually stimulating experiences.

Digital Marketing Agencies embrace generative AI service offerings  
Digital marketing agencies, like Credera for example, are beginning to offer 
AI capabilities as a part of a package or a la carte offering: generative AI 
services like content creation, AI large language model tuning, computer 
vision, optimizing the customer journey through next best action modeling, 
and leveraging AI models to augment expertise as co-pilots. Agencies view 
generative AI as a useful tool to quickly create marketing assets and content 
that resonates with target audiences. With the adoption of generative AI, it is 
likely that more than 20% of current marketing operations can be automated, 
resulting in changes to how marketing and advertising agencies are struc-
tured, how they plan their offerings, how they gain competitive advantage or 
drive their margins, and more. 
Leveraging AI-generated artwork to fuel user-generated creative contests 
User-generated creative contests centered around AI created artwork have 
the potential to inspire new ideas for marketing. By having consumers en-
gage with and create content based on AI art, businesses can source in -
novative marketing concepts. This trend of crowdsourcing ideas from user 
contests built around AI art presents an opportunity for fresh and creative 
marketing campaigns.
Generative AI accessibility to transform marketing processes 
The increased accessibility of generative AI will allow marketers to gain more 
insights, automate more tasks, and create more customized and engaging 
content, changing how marketing campaigns are strategized and executed. 
Tasks that would consume significant amounts of time and labor, from proof -
reading copy to managing ad campaign workflow, from updating customer 
information in a database to analyzing customer sentiment regarding a prod-
uct or the shopping experience itself, from broader sentiment analysis to 
improvements in how we think about and position brand identity will become 
increasingly automated, advertisers and marketers will focus on higher-value 
marketing tasks that augment the marketer’s creativity and expertise, and 
businesses will be able to effectively allocate marketing talent where it’s most 
needed. Rather than thinking that generative AI will replace marketing talent, 
the better paradigm is to assume that these technologies will enable new 
marketing talent and augment existing expertise. Planning will matter more. 
Strategy will become more important than tactics. And the marketers that rise 
to the top will be those that use AI as part of their strategic engagement, not 
as a replacement for it.1

3Implications for Marketers:15
Business Trend 3: 
Emerging media 
gives marketers new 
opportunities for reach 
and presents new 
challenges for marketing 
measurement.
CURATION:
The megatrend of Curation  acknowledges that with 
increased media consumption comes increased 
expectations to see carefully selected content 
according to one’s own preferences. Social media 
has empowered individuals of all generations, from 
Generation Z to Baby Boomers, to curate their digi -
tal experiences, making authenticity and interactiv-
ity key. As the algorithms behind these apps learn 
more about consumer preferences, consumers, in 
turn, become more accustomed to hyper-targeted, 
finely curated content that is constantly available.
Curation supposes that consumers not only crave 
customization, but have come to expect it as stan -
dard. Similar to the Simplicity Megatrend, consum-
ers are exchanging their data and preferences for 
content that demonstrates a true understanding 
of their preferences. This opens up new avenues 
for brands to establish deeper and more mean -
ingful connections with their audience. In a world 
where consumers expect customized experiences, 
marketers must embrace curation as a powerful 
tool to stay relevant and resonate with their target 
demographic. As a result, marketers are now curat-
ing traditional ads based on the apps consumers 
use, as exemplified by Uber and Instacart in-app 
ads. Others are turning to dedicated retail media 
networks, in an effort to acknowledge consumer 
desires for tailored content.16
The media landscape is rapidly evolving, providing new and innovative ways for brands to reach today’s 
digitally connected consumers. As consumer behavior shifts towards increased mobile usage and 
streaming, the advertising industry must adapt to take advantage of emerging opportunities. Marketing 
on emerging media requires adaptability and new analytical approaches, and is a useful tool for gathering 
valuable consumer insights and expanding brand awareness. With smart goals and metrics tailored to 
each platform and campaign, marketers can leverage digital innovations while demonstrating concrete 
ROI. The challenge is translating the excitement of creative potential into measurable impact.
One area of growth is retail media networks. As consumers browse and purchase more online, retailers 
have a wealth of shopper data and can enable targeted advertising within their owned properties. For ex-
ample, Walmart Connect offers brands the ability to place ads on Walmart’s website and app. Advertisers 
can use insights into purchase intent and past purchases to reach consumers while they’re in shopping 
mode. Another example of this is Last Yard, a retail media technology that empowers retailers to rapidly 
innovate their in-store customer experience with a digital shelf edge that dynamically updates with pro-
motional information in store.
Connected TV (CTV) is also on the rise. With the shift away from linear TV, brands can now engage 
streaming audiences programmatically. Ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) services like Hulu and 
Tubi are gaining popularity, offering brands access to engaged viewing environments. Programmatic CTV 
provides advanced creative, targeting, optimization and measurement capabilities to meet campaign 
goals. It’s predicted that “more than $30 billion will be spent on CTV ads by 2025” ( eMarketer). With more 
viewers cutting the cord and shifting to streaming platforms on their internet-connected TVs, CTV adver-
tising provides a huge opportunity to reach engaged audiences at scale. 
Many consumers are heading to streaming platforms in search of a better viewing experience. With 
consumers demanding shorter commercial breaks from their content providers, it comes as no surprise 
that streaming services have turned to new ways to reach consumers and meet their business objectives. 
New virtual product placement solutions implement advertising directly within the content stream that 
audiences are watching and serve to increase monetization opportunities for publishers while minimiz -
ing or complementing current ad loads. This leads to a better consumer experience and more effective 
advertising, all done programmatically. Additionally, by leveraging the technology to power these inte -
grated ad experiences partners can enrich the ecosystem with new contextual marketers and ultimately 
enhance targeting within the neighboring commercial break.TECHNOLOGY TREND 3:   
Emerging Media Opportunities to Reach On-The-Go 
audiences - CTV, Retail Media & Transportation Ad 
Networks 17
Notable Examples:
TripleLift  - Programmatic advertising technology 
company TripleLift  pioneered a solution for dy -
namically inserting product placement ads into 
streaming TV shows by using a combination of 
custom-built models and machine learning (ML) 
on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The solution first 
identifies locations and surface areas in premium 
video and TV content using an ML pipeline; it dy -
namically composites brands and nonintrusive ad 
units into select scenes; and then it inserts the new 
scenes into the real-time stream using server-side 
ad insertion, all without interrupting the viewing 
experience. As consumers move toward streaming 
TV and are looking for lower ad loads across plat -forms, this is a unique way for marketers to reach 
audiences with compelling and relevant advertising 
while they are engaged with content. By using this 
solution, TripleLift enables advertisers to improve 
ad effectiveness and recall and provides publish -
ers with automated ways to increase revenue per 
stream for over-the-top (OTT) and connected TV 
environments.
SpringServe  - now part of Magnite , is the leading 
independent ad serving platform, purpose-built for 
OTT, CTV and video advertising. Its software offers 
a full stack of ad serving, optimization and automa -
tion solutions that make video ad serving smarter 
across devices. Trusted by leading publishers & 
advanced TV distributors, its platform delivers con-Fragmentation across different devices, platforms and apps makes measurement much more complex, 
prompting marketers to adjust their measurement strategies to make the most of CTV. Advertisers and 
marketers need to unify cross-screen measurement by leveraging identity solutions for CTV. As viewers 
move between devices, marketers need a persistent and privacy-compliant way to understand their be -
haviors. Through integrations with identity providers like LiveRamp, TransUnion and UID 2.0, AWS em-
powers marketers to create consistent consumer IDs across channels. This unified approach is key for 
measuring true campaign reach and frequency across CTV and other screens. Advertisers and marketers 
are also encouraged to shift to outcome-based measurement models for CTV. Rather than optimizing 
for vanity metrics like clicks and impressions, marketers need to connect ad exposures on CTV to real 
business outcomes. AWS enables this through integrations with CRM data, multi-touch attribution mod-
els and machine learning to quantify how CTV ads impact metrics like site traffic, registrations and sales. 
This focus on business impact is crucial for understanding CTV’s value.
The third area of note is the emergence of in-app transportation advertising. Ride sharing and food deliv -
ery platforms have amassed large, valuable user bases. Brands like McDonald’s and State Farm advertise 
in apps like Uber to connect with audiences literally on the go. Geo-targeting and user context, like know-
ing that a user is headed to the airport, allow for highly relevant messages. As daily activities become 
increasingly digitized, new media exposure opportunities emerge.
The common thread across these emerging channels is the ability to combine data and context to 
deliver the right ad to the right user at the right time and place. As consumers spend more time across 
mobile, streaming and transactional ecosystems, advertising must meet them there. Brands that lever-
age these capabilities and new environments will propel their business growth. With innovation unfold-
ing at a rapid pace, agility and testing will be critical. Advertisers must stay on the pulse of consumer 
shifts and platform opportunities to optimize reach and relevance. While change brings complexity, the 
possibilities to achieve business goals by engaging digitally-savvy audiences in compelling new ways 
are tremendous. By leveraging retail media, CTV and in-app ads, brands can break through the clutter 
and creatively connect with target consumers in the moments that matter most.18
trol, transparency, and analytics to help increase 
ad performance and revenue from media sales. 
SpringServe is certified as one of the first compa -
nies to join Amazon Publisher Services’ Ad Server 
Certification Program. This allows publishers to 
implement a simplified APS header bidding integra-
tion while maximizing the benefits of programmatic 
monetization across their streaming TV endpoints. 
In addition to publishers, advertisers also benefit 
through increased access to streaming TV invento-
ry with APS header bidding.
Last Yard - Last Yard is an in-store marketing auto-
mation technology that allows retailers to design 
and execute promotions at the shelf edge using 
real-time product and pricing data. Their Digital 
Shelf Edge (DSE) is used to attract attention to a 
specific product, promotion or brand. DSE supports 
high quality eye-catching visuals on the shelf edge. 
The Last Yard Platform serves as a central hub that 
houses over 400 of our customer’s business rules. 
These rules process data from 25 data sources 
and automate over 100,000 decisions per day for 
this large supermarket chain. These decisions in -
clude whether or not a ticket should be printed (or 
taken off the shelf), the product details that appear 
on tickets or screens, and how they are presented 
visually. You can find this solution  available at AWS 
Marketplace.Uber in-app video advertising - Uber announced 
video advertising an option to reach users as they 
wait for their ride to arrive. This opens up a new 
opportunity for Uber to generate revenue through 
video advertising while riders are essentially a cap -
tive audience. The move comes as Uber looks for 
new sources of income beyond its core ride-hailing 
business. For Uber, video ads present a smart way 
to monetize their platform beyond basic ride fees. 
While they take a cut of all rides, ads give them 
an additional revenue stream. As a bonus, riders 
may perceive waiting time to go faster when they 
have ads to watch. For a service based on conve-
nience, the perception of faster pickup is a big win 
for Uber. Uber’s new capability should excite mar-
keters. The targeting options provide strong foun-
dations for executing highly focused campaigns. 
The launch opens up possibilities for creative new 
campaigns. A sports apparel brand could show an 
inspiring ad of athlete preparation and persever-
ance before big events. A quick-service restaurant 
could display a lively montage of delicious food 
that connects with hungry users at mealtimes. The 
options are endless. 19
Implications for Marketers:
Brands need to advertise where consumers are spending their time.   
The consumer today is spending more time shopping online, making the need for a retail 
media network more important than ever. Retail Media Network solutions on AWS help 
retailers build an advertising infrastructure to meet the consumer where they are. Re -
tail media networks can help brands reach and engage shoppers, whether that means 
shopping online, in stores, or browsing an app. For retailers looking to capitalize on this 
fast-growing advertising market, AWS provides proven technologies and retail expertise 
to quickly get started. With scalable audience reach, actionable insights, and innovative 
ad formats, AWS retail media networks present a major revenue growth channel that also 
supports core retail operations.
Leveraging expert consultants for new connected TV marketing  
measurement approaches 
Connected TV (CTV) advertising is a fast-growing channel that marketers cannot ignore. 
CTV provides an engaged, receptive audience in a premium content environment. How -
ever, running effective CTV campaigns requires expertise in areas like audience target -
ing, ad creative optimization, and campaign measurement. This is where working with 
experienced partners and leveraging cloud infrastructure from AWS can make a major 
difference. Partnering with global solution integrators and agencies are a good place to 
start to bring deep marketing strategy experience and proprietary tools to help brands 
plan, execute, and measure CTV campaigns. Their strategic approach includes defining 
campaign objectives, ideating relevant creative, building targeted audience segments, 
forecasting reach and frequency, optimizing media planning, and continuously improv -
ing performance. With an array of proprietary tools and methodologies in areas like 
audience insights, creative testing, and multi-touch attribution enable them to maximize 
campaign effectiveness. 
Ensuring a solid first-party data foundation strategy to consumer  
reach across devices 
Having a strong first-party data foundation strategy is critical for brands to reach and 
engage with consumers across devices in a relevant way. First-party data is any informa -
tion that a brand collects directly from its own customers, site visitors, app users, email 
subscribers, and other owned channels. This type of data is extremely valuable because 
it provides direct insights into who your customers are, what they care about, and how to 
engage them across the buyer’s journey. With a strong first-party data foundation, brands 
can develop personalized experiences, predict customer needs, and measure market -
ing performance accurately. Recommend marketers to: 1/ Identify your data collection 
points. 2/ Develop or invest in a customer data platform (CDP) 3/ Implement analytics 
and attribution modeling. 4/ Build a data science team. 5/ Aim to create a unified custom -
er profile for marketing activation across media plans 6/ Test out new media placements 
that target captive audiences or changing consumer habits like transportation ads.1

Business Trend 4: 
It’s more crucial than 
ever for brands to 
lead with purpose in 
both their message 
and their business 
practices.
CATAL YZATION: 
The Catalyzation  Megatrend is driven by the aspi -
ration to become better individuals, with brands 
serving as catalysts in this endeavor. This trend 
holds particular significance for Millennial and Gen 
Z consumers, who predominantly rely on consum-
er-generated media for their news. Consuming 
news from a grassroots perspective instills in them 
a sense of personal responsibility to contribute to 
global betterment. Additionally, they will respond 
well to brands that join them in their cause.
 
In the realm of marketing, authenticity is para-
mount, as consumers can discern if sustainabili -
ty efforts are merely superficial. Because of that, 
sustainable marketing should be accompanied 
by tangible, transparent practices that address 
the growing skepticism surrounding greenwash -
ing messaging.21
In an era where environmental and social responsibility are taking center stage, sustainable marketing 
and advertising have emerged as powerful tools for businesses to convey their commitment to the planet 
and to society. These practices involve promoting environmentally and socially responsible products, in-
tegrating sustainable values, and championing initiatives that align with global objectives. Going beyond 
marketing alone, brands are changing the way they work with strategies like the migration of workloads 
to the cloud in an effort to reduce their overall carbon footprint.  
 
As consumers become increasingly aware of the impact businesses have on the environment and so -
ciety, sustainability has moved from a fringe issue to a critical mainstream concern. Brands that fail to 
communicate and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability risk losing consumer trust and loyal-
ty. However, sustainability in marketing and advertising cannot be treated superficially. Greenwashing, 
or overstating a company’s environmental credentials, can backfire with today’s savvy, purpose-driven 
consumers, prompting brands to integrate sustainability into their core business model and messaging in 
authentic ways.
Take Patagonia, an outdoor apparel company with a long history of environmental activism. Patagonia’s 
marketing does more than pay lip service to sustainability - its entire brand ethos centers around pro-
tecting nature and empowering a movement of responsible consumers. Through compelling storytelling, 
thought leadership, and consistent business practices, Patagonia makes environmentalism accessible 
and inspiring to its community. Similarly, consumer goods giant Unilever has committed to a business 
model that delivers growth sustainably. With over 400 brands including Dove, Lipton, and Ben & Jerry’s, 
Unilever set ambitious sustainability goals around waste reduction, sustainable sourcing, and decreasing 
its carbon footprint. Importantly, these goals shape how the business operates and how brands commu -
nicate to customers. Unilever CEO Alan Jope declared, “Brands with purpose grow. Brands with purpose 
last. And brands with purpose drive change.”
Consumers are holding businesses to higher standards and voting with their wallets accordingly. While 
some businesses have always prioritized sustainability, it’s more crucial than ever for all brands to lead 
with purpose in both their message and their practices. Brands must back up sustainability messag -
ing by making substantial commitments and investments, like Walmart’s pledge  to become  emissions  
neutral by 2040  or IKEA’s move  to use only renewable  and recycled materials  in products and packag-
ing. Moreover, initiatives like B Corporations  provide frameworks to embed sustainability into the DNA of 
a company. Migrating technology to the cloud can help businesses be more sustainable, AWS can lower 
the workload carbon footprint of average on-premises data centers by nearly 80% today and up to 96% 
once AWS is powered with 100% renewable energy.TECHNOLOGY TREND 4:   
Sustainability in 
Advertising and Marketing 
is in Focus22
Notable Examples:
 
AWS Climate Pledge Friendly - The AWS Climate 
Pledge Friendly initiative is a part of Amazon’s 
broader commitment to sustainability and envi -
ronmental preservation, and is focused on helping 
consumers discover and purchase more sustain -
able products. To achieve this, Amazon collabo-
rates with trusted third-party certifications and has 
developed its own certifications. These certifica -
tions are then used to identify products that meet 
sustainability standards, promoting eco-friendly 
choices. Climate Pledge Friendly is designed to 
highlight products that have made improvements 
in at least one aspect of sustainability. It is an 
ongoing effort, with plans to expand the range of 
certifications and work closely with manufacturers 
to certify more products over time. Consumers can 
easily identify Climate Pledge Friendly products 
while shopping on Amazon, with labels prominently 
displayed on eligible products in search results and 
on individual product pages. This label provides 
information about the specific sustainability cer -
tifications that the product has earned, making it 
easier for environmentally conscious consumers 
to make informed choices. Amazon’s commitment 
to sustainability extends beyond this initiative. Through The Climate Pledge and other sustainabil -
ity efforts, the company aims to reduce its environ-
mental footprint and provide sustainable shopping 
options. By promoting Climate Pledge Friendly 
products, Amazon contributes to the preservation 
of the natural world and encourages sustainable 
consumption among its customers. This initiative 
reflects Amazon’s dedication to minimizing its 
impact on the planet and fostering a more environ-
mentally responsible approach to e-commerce.
LEGO makes long-term commitment to sustain-
ability of product  - showcases the progression of 
a long term sustainability commitment The LEGO 
Ideas Treehouse and Sustainability Mission - You -
Tube).The LEGO brand is marketing themselves as 
a sustainable brand with a purpose both in method 
and in messaging. LEGO launched a sustainability 
initiative in 2017 with the goal of making all LEGO 
blocks from sustainable materials by 2030. The 
company recently opened a carbon-neutral facto-
ry in Virginia , representing its latest milestone as 
LEGO continues efforts underway since 2016 to im-
prove the environmental impact of its manufactur -
ing operations through steps like using renewable 
energy and finding recycled/bio-based substitutes 
for plastics.Advertising, too, must reflect this focus on positive impact. Creative that connects sustainability with 
emotions and aspirations, not just rational benefits, resonates most powerfully with audiences. The 
brands that will thrive today understand that sustainability can’t be an afterthought or a nice-to-have - it 
must be a core value. With pressing societal challenges ahead, businesses have both an imperative and 
an opportunity to drive change through their advertising, innovation, supply chains and culture. As expec -
tations rise, the bar for corporate leadership and accountability will only get higher. Brands that embrace 
sustainability as central to their purpose will stay ahead.
Authenticity is paramount in building consumer trust. Sustainability is a long-term commitment rather 
than only a trend. Transparency is key in communicating sustainable efforts, as consumers become 
increasingly more discerning and seek evidence of genuine environmental and societal commitment 
from the brands they align themselves with. While marketing and advertising play pivotal roles, business -
es should also address the environmental impact of these practices. In particular, exploring sustainable 
advertising methods or migrating business practices to the cloud are essential considerations to reduce 
the carbon footprint associated with digital advertising, and aligns with causes that are key to today’s 
consumer.23
Traceable Textile - Traceable textiles refer to 
fabrics and clothing that can be traced back to 
their origin, including the materials and processes 
used. This traceability allows for more transpar-
ency and accountability in the textile supply chain, 
supporting sustainability by ensuring fair labor 
practices, reduced pollution, and ethical sourcing 
of raw materials. Promoting traceable textiles is an 
important element in making the fashion industry 
more sustainable overall. An example of this is the 
OEKO-TEX® brand which promotes the traceable 
nature of their textile products in their marketing.

Implications for Marketers:
Demonstrating a commitment to environmental and societal 
well-being beyond marketing messaging
This will enhance brand reputation and foster customer loyalty. Eval-
uate the products or services sustainability model at its core versus 
approaching at a surface level only focused on marketing messag -

top-down leadership level to drive real impact.
Ensuring authenticity in sustainability claims 
Deceptive practices can erode consumer trust. Challenges include 
avoiding greenwashing – examples like Traceable Textile and AWS 
Climate Pledge Friendly address this by promoting transparency
Prioritizing sustainable advertising practices  
Consider measuring and offsetting carbon footprints for accountabil -

Business Trend 5: 
A new era of 
modularization of 
marketing technology 
stacks customized to 
fit bespoke business 
needs is rising in 
popularity.
PERSONALIZATION:
As seen in the Simplicity and Curation Megatrends, 
Personalization  is a Megatrend that shows con -
sumer behavior impacted by increased connectivity 
and what consumers expect in return for their data. 
Unlike Simplicity and Curation, Personalization is 
about custom-made services. These fully bespoke 
pieces are often informed by technology that en -
ables both data collection and easy customization. 
Composable tech stacks are a prime example 
of this, and are revolutionizing the foundation on 
which consumers construct their technological 
frameworks, ushering in an era of unprecedent -
ed customization. This shift is not merely about 
the ability to sell these tools à la carte but rather 
represents a profound evolution in the marketing 
paradigm. The concept of composable tech stacks, 
akin to building blocks, empowers consumers to 
craft bespoke marketing infrastructures tailored 
to their unique requirements, ensuring agility and 
adaptability to emerging trends. However, the true 
essence of this transformation lies in the augmen -
tation of personalization capabilities.26
Personalization has become an irreplaceable cornerstone of modern marketing. Customer data plat -
forms (CDPs), serving as the foundation for invaluable customer information, allow marketers to harness 
the power of personalization effectively. The implications for marketers are endless, as they now possess 
the means to not only comprehend their customers on a deeper level but also to connect, enrich, and 
enhance their data through strategic partnerships. The consolidation of data within CDPs simplifies the 
marketer’s task by providing a holistic view of customer information, thereby streamlining decision-mak -
ing processes. As a result, achieving personalization by leveraging composable tech stacks is a timeless 
trend underscoring the importance of reaching the right person with the right message at the right time. 
Composable marketing technology stacks provide users with modular, building block-like tools that align 
seamlessly with the escalating demand for hyper-personalization. They empower users with a truly à la 
carte approach to digital system construction, allowing them to unpack the bundled offerings of the past. 
This shift is enabling the creation of highly customized and relevant solutions that are inherently modular 
by design. Composable marketing technology stacks, renowned for their interconnected nature, empower 
organizations to construct technology architecture capable of effortlessly adjusting to ever-changing de -
mands. They play a pivotal role in enhancing data connectivity, seamlessness, better customization and 
operational efficiency – essential for those looking to excel in an era driven by hyper-personalization. 
Personalization has become table stakes for brands looking to engage and retain customers in an in -
creasingly crowded marketplace. Research shows personalized experiences lead to higher conversion 
rates, increased lifetime value, and greater customer satisfaction. However, delivering personalized, om-
nichannel experiences at scale remains a challenge for many organizations. This is where composable 
customer data platforms come in. 
In today’s digital landscape, marketers need technology solutions that are as agile and adaptable as their 
strategies. Opting for a composable approach provides marketers the flexibility to use best-of-breed 
solutions for each of their needs, rather than being locked into a single vendor’s limited capabilities. As 
marketing strategies evolve, composable marketing technology stacks can evolve right alongside them. 
A composable marketing technology stack is made up of integrated yet independent tools that each ex -
cel at one function. Designed to work together seamlessly, these tools pass customer data and insights 
between platforms, allowing marketers to swap out or add new tools as needs change, without disrupting 
the entire tech stack. The most critical component binding these solutions together is the CDP , serving as 
the foundation on which modular stacks are built. A marketer’s chosen CDP ingests and organizes cus -
tomer data from all channels and sources into a universal framework, distributing data across the tech -TECHNOLOGY TREND 5:   
The Rise of the 
“Composable” Marketing 
Technology Stacks27
nology stack in a ready-to-use format. This approach solves two major challenges of modern marketing, 
first eliminating data silos by centralizing all data into a single CDP to give marketers a complete view of 
each customer. Secondly, it provides flexibility to use the right tools for each marketing need, meaning 
marketers are no longer confined to solutions from a single solutions provider.
An AWS composable framework offers the flexibility for marketers and advertisers to build hybrid solu -
tions powered by AWS. Each component can be interlocked with each other to create a single solution 
that meets marketers business objectives, combining both AWS Services and AWS Partners. For exam-
ple, marketers for airline companies may be looking to ‘increase ancillary sales per user and plane book -
ing’, whereas a retail marketer may be interested in ‘lowering customer acquisition cost, increase average 
basket value and repeat purchases’ and in the gaming industry, marketers may be looking for ‘to acquire 
new players and monetize them’. An AWS composable framework for marketers enables them to build 
a marketing technology stack that fits their bespoke business needs to engage marketers on their most 
critical challenges. 
For example, a composable marketing technology stack may include a variety of solutions providers from 
different categories such as customer data, customer intelligence, or customer experience:
Service partners play a crucial role in bringing together composable tech stacks by uniting various com -
ponents and contributing to a platform’s overall success by integrating specialized technologies and 
diverse points of view.  Explore the list of AWS advertising and marketing service partners here.
Together, these tools create a modular stack that aligns perfectly with the marketer’s strategies and objec-
tives. As needs evolve, the marketer can replace or upgrade tools without needing to rip and replace the 
entire stack. What makes them “composable” is their modular components that can be assembled in dif-
ferent combinations to meet specific business needs. Instead of an all-in-one black box, composable tech 
stacks let you select only the capabilities you want. This makes them adaptable, flexible and scalable.

Implications for Marketers:
Leverage holistic customer insights
A composable CDP breaks down data silos, aggregating behavioral, transac-
tional, and observational data from across an organization’s marketing tech -
nology stack into a single customer record. This provides a more holistic view 
of customer interactions and preferences across channels over time. These 
unified profiles enable deeper customer segmentation and more precise tar -
geting. Marketers can leverage these tools to consolidate diverse data sourc-
es, gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, and employ 
precise targeting strategies.
Ensure more agile deployment 
Marketers can start small and add capabilities as needed with compos -
able architecture. Compostable architecture allows you to deploy specific 
use cases like personalized site experiences or triggered messages across 
platforms, without investing in capabilities you don’t need yet. This fail-fast 
approach gets campaigns launched faster. As your needs evolve, you simply 
plug in new data sources or applications.
Future-proof flexibility
Marketers can ensure they’re staying on top of constantly changing customer 
data infrastructure requirements. Flexible marketing technology stacks allow 
marketers to respond rapidly to new trends like digital wallet IDs or emerging 
channels like the metaverse. Their microservices approach makes it easy to 
swap individual components in and out, so you can innovate without
disrupting existing systems.1

 cultivating online communities to foster brand loyalty.   The digital landscape has also led to a surge in 
omnichannel shopping experiences. Consumers expect a seamless transition between physical and digital 
touchpoints, blurring the lines between online and offline retail. This has compelled businesses to create 
integrated strategies that deliver consistent experiences across various platforms, from e -commerce 
websites to mobile apps and brick -and-mortar stores.  
The Impact of Digital Transformation on Business Strategies.  
1. Data -Driven Decision Making:  
The availability of vast amounts of data has revolutionized the way businesses make decisions. Through 
data analytics, companies can gain insights into consumer prefer ences, market trends, and operational 
inefficiencies. This empowers businesses to make informed choices and tailor strategies that resonate with 
their target audience.  
2. Personalization and Customer -Centricity:  
Digital transformation has shifted the focus  from mass marketing to personalized experiences. Businesses 
now have the tools to understand individual customer preferences and behaviors, enabling them to offer 
tailored products, recommendations, and marketing messages. This level of personalization en hances 
customer engagement and loyalty.  
3. Omni -Channel Engagement:  
The integration of digital platforms has blurred the lines between online and offline experiences. 
Businesses are now required to provide a seamless omni -channel experience, where customer s can 
transition effortlessly between different touchpoints, whether it's a physical store, a website, or a mobile 
app. This demands cohesive strategies that maintain consistency across various platforms.  
 
4. Agile and Adaptive Strategies:  
The rapid pace of  technological change necessitates businesses to be agile and adaptive. Traditional long -
term business plans are being replaced by more flexible strategies that can respond quickly to market shifts 
and emerging opportunities. This dynamic approach allows b usinesses to stay relevant and competitive in a 
rapidly changing landscape.  
5. Innovation and Disruption:

 6. E-Commerce and Digital Marketing:  
The rise of e -commerce has compelled businesses to rethink their sales and marketing strategies. Online 
storefronts, secure payment gateways, and efficient supply chains are crucial components of modern 
business strategies. Digital marketing, including social media campai gns, content marketing, and search 
engine optimization, has become essential to reach and engage consumers effectively.  
 
7. Collaboration and Partnerships:  
Digital transformation has fostered an environment of collaboration and partnerships. Companies are 
increasingly collaborating with tech firms, startups, and even competitors to harness each other's strengths 
and innovate together. These alliances allow businesses to access new markets, technologies, and resources 
they may not have otherwise.  
Moreover, t he effects of digital transformation extend beyond individual businesses and consumers, 
influencing the broader economic landscape. Let's delve deeper into some of the additional impacts, 
considerations, and future prospects brought about by this ongoing t ransformation.  
 Supply Chain Transformation:  The digitization of supply chains has been a critical aspect of 
business adaptation. With real -time data sharing, organizations can monitor inventory levels, track 
shipments, and optimize production processes. This leads to increased efficiency, reduced 
operational costs, and improved responsiveness to changing market demands. Supply chain 
visibility also enables better risk management by identifying potential disruptions and allowing for 
timely adjustments.  
 Data as a Strategic Asset:  In the digital age, data has emerged as a valuable resource that drives 
decision -making and innovation. Businesses are harnessing the power of data analytics to uncover 
insights about consumer preferences, market trends, and operati onal inefficiencies. This data -driven 
approach helps in the development of tailored products, personalized marketing campaigns, and 
more accurate demand forecasting.  
 Rise of Artificial Intelligence and Automation:   Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automati on 
technologies have significantly impacted various industries, influencing both consumer experiences 
and business operations. Chatbots and virtual assistants, powered by AI, provide instant customer 
support and enhance user engagement. On the business sid e, AI -driven algorithms analyze vast 
amounts of data to optimize processes, from supply chain management to targeted advertising.  
Automation has transformed routine and repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources for more 
strategic and creative endeavors.  While this has led to concerns about job displacement, it also 
creates opportunities for upskilling the workforce to manage and maintain these technologies.  
 Environmental Sustainability:   Digital transformation has also enabled businesses to adopt more 
sustainable practices. The transition to paperless operations, remote work arrangements, and the use © 2018  JETIR October 2018 , Vol ume 5, Issue 10                                                    www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)  
JETIR1810B2 4 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org  509 
 of digital platforms for communication and collaboration has reduced the carbon footprint of many 
organizations. Additionally, data analytics can be leverage d to identify areas where energy 
consumption can be minimized, contributing to environmental conservation.  
 Challenges and Ethical Considerations:  Digital transformation has brought about ethical 
dilemmas and challenges as well. Issues related to data priva cy, security breaches, and the 
responsible use of AI are at the forefront of discussions. The collection and analysis of vast 
amounts of personal data raise concerns about consumer privacy and the potential for data misuse. 
Striking a balance between utili zing data for business growth and safeguarding individual rights 
remains a delicate challenge.  
Furthermore, the digital divide presents a significant social concern. While digital transformation offers 
tremendous benefits, not all individuals and communiti es have equal access to technology and the 
opportunities it brings. Ensuring inclusivity and accessibility should be a priority to prevent exacerbating 
existing social inequalities.  
CASE STUDIES:  
To illustrate the real -world impact of digital transformation on consumer behavior and business 
strategies, let's consider a few case studies from different industries.  
1. Amazon:  Transforming Retail and Customer Expectations  
Amazon's digital transformation journey has fundamentally changed the retail landscape. By 
leveraging data analytics and AI, Amazon offers personalized product recommendations, efficient supply 
chain management, and seamless checkout processes. This has set a new standard for customer 
expectations in terms of convenience, speed, an d customization. As a result, traditional retailers have had to 
adapt by investing in e -commerce platforms and enhancing their online presence to remain competitive.  
2. Airbnb: Redefining Hospitality and Trust  
Airbnb's platform -based model has disrupted  the hospitality industry, allowing individuals to rent 
out their homes to travelers. Through digital transformation, Airbnb has built a platform that prioritizes 
user reviews, ratings, and transparent communication between hosts and guests. This approach has fostered 
a sense of trust and authenticity, reshaping consumer preferences for travel accommodations and 
encouraging a shift away from traditional hotels.  
3. Nike: Fusion of Retail and Technology  
Nike has embraced digital transformation by integrating technology into its retail strategy. The Nike 
app offers personalized shopping experiences, exclusive product launches, and fitness tracking capabilities. 
The Nike Training Club app provides customers with workout plans and training sessions, creating a 
holistic brand experience beyond traditional retail. This fusion of technology and retail has allowed Nike to 
engage with customers on a deeper level.  © 2018  JETIR October 2018 , Vol ume 5, Issue 10                                                    www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)

to technology. Bridging the digital divide is crucial to ensure inclusivity and prevent exacerbating existing 
inequalities, requiring innovative approaches to provide equal opportunities for all.  
4. Ethical Considerations: As AI and automation become more integrated into business strategies, ethical 
concerns arise. Businesses must navigate issues related to bias in al gorithms, job displacement due to 
automation, and the responsible use of AI to ensure a positive impact on society.

development of new products, services, and business models. Businesses that embrace disruptive 
technologies have the opportunity to reshape markets and gain a competitive advantage.  © 2018  JETIR October 2018 , Vol ume 5, Issue 10                                                    www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)  
JETIR1810B2 4 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org  511 
 4. Global Reach: The digital landscape enables businesses to reach a global audience without the

5. Agile Decision -Making: Real -time data a nalytics empowers businesses to make agile, data -driven 
decisions. This ability to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and consumer preferences positions 
companies to seize opportunities and respond effectively to challenges.  
6. Sustainability Init iatives: Digital transformation can contribute to sustainability efforts. By optimizing 
supply chains, reducing paper usage, and adopting remote work practices, businesses can reduce their 
environmental footprint and appeal to eco -conscious consumers.  
Future Prospects:  
Looking ahead, the trajectory of digital transformation shows no signs of slowing down. Emerging 
technologies such as 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and augmented reality (AR) are poised 
to further reshape the consumer -business dynamic. These technologies will enable even more seamless 
connectivity, greater personalization, and novel ways of interacting with products and services.  
CONCLUSION:  
The impact of digital transformation on consumer behavior and business  strategies has ushered in a 
new era of connectivity, innovation, and opportunities. The evolution of technology has fundamentally 
altered the way consumers interact with brands and make purchasing decisions. Access to information, peer 
recommendations, an d personalized experiences has  become integral aspects of the modern consumer 
journey.   Businesses, in turn, have undergone a paradigm shift in their strategies. The integration of data 
analytics, artificial intelligence, and e -commerce has allowed for a d eeper understanding of consumer 
preferences, leading to tailored marketing initiatives and enhanced customer engagement. The transition 
from traditional ownership models to access -based sharing economy platforms exemplifies the adaptability 
of businesses i n catering to evolving consumer demands.  However, this transformation is not without its 
challenges. Data privacy concerns and cybersecurity threats demand stringent measures to protect 
consumer information and maintain trust. Moreover, ensuring inclusivit y and bridging the digital divide 
becomes imperative, as not all segments of society have equal access to the benefits of digital 
transformation.   In this landscape, businesses that prioritize customer -centricity and agility will stand to 
gain the most. Th ose who can navigate the challenges of data security, harness the power of digital tools, 
and maintain an unwavering focus on delivering value to consumers will not only thrive but also shape the 
future of their industries.   In essence, the impact of digit al transformation transcends mere technological 
change; it touches upon every facet of consumer behavior and business strategy. By leveraging these 
changes and aligning them with consumer expectations, businesses can forge a path towards sustained 
growth, innovation, and success in an increasingly digital world.  © 2018  JETIR October 2018 , Vol ume 5, Issue 10                                                    www.jetir.org (ISSN -2349 -5162)
